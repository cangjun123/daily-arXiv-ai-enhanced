While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "TANDEM\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u4ec7\u6068\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ece\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u534f\u540c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u957f\u7bc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f80\u5f80\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u867d\u7136\u81ea\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u662f'\u9ed1\u7bb1'\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc1\u636e\uff08\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8eab\u4efd\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TANDEM\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4e32\u8054\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8ba9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7ea6\u675f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTANDEM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728HateMM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522bF1\u5f97\u5206\u8fbe\u52300.73\uff08\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u597d\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad830%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u6d4b\u867d\u7136\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u5192\u72af\u6027\u548c\u4ec7\u6068\u6027\u5185\u5bb9\u4f9d\u7136\u56e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u6838\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\u3002"}}

An Exploratory Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors.

We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point.

Through a three-phase iterative design study (N = 8), we empirically mapped this tension. Phase I revealed a \"Safety-Guidance Gap\": while a Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) robot established safety (d = 3.27), users felt insufficiently coached. Phase II identified a \"Scaffolding Paradox\": rigid feedback caused cognitive overload, while delayed feedback lacked specificity. In Phase III, we resolved these tensions by developing an Agency-Driven Interaction Layer. Synthesizing our empirical findings, we propose the Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem, a conceptual framework that redefines robotic coaching not as a static script, but as a dynamic balance between affective support and instructional challenge, mediated by user agency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \\(-11.6\\%\\) with the baseline LLM to \\(+9.5\\%\\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality.

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $\u03c6^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u53cc\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u65cf\uff08\u6709\u7406\u4e09\u6b21\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u3001\u4e09\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u5168\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u3001\u5177\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u9006\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66ff\u4ee3\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f84\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u80fd\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u8026\u5408\u6d41\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5bfb\u627e\u65e2\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f3a\u53c8\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u548c\u6613\u5904\u7406\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u53cc\u5c04\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u5149\u6ed1\u4e14\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u9006\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff1b\u5355\u8c03\u6837\u6761\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u4f46\u4ec5\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u4e14\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u6709\u754c\u57df\u4e0a\uff1b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u5b9e\u73b0\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u9006\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5404\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u5c04\u65cf\uff1a\u6709\u7406\u4e09\u6b21\u3001\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u3001\u4e09\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\uff08C\u221e\uff09\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u5168\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u3001\u5177\u6709\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u6790\u9006\u3002\n2. \u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cc\u5c04\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u5f84\u5411\u5750\u6807\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89d2\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "1. \u57281D\u548c2D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u5728\u8026\u5408\u6d41\u4e2d\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6837\u6761\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\n2. \u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f84\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u80fd\u7528\u6bd4\u8026\u5408\u6d41\u5c111000\u500d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\n3. \u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u03c6\u2074\u6676\u683c\u573a\u8bba\uff09\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eff\u5c04\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u53cc\u5c04\u65cf\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff08\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u3001\u5168\u5b9e\u6570\u57df\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ID\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0eOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u521d\u59cb\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u57fa\u51c6\u540e\u53cd\u800c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u548cOOD\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8ffd\u6c42ID\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9aResNet-50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u752821\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406SOTA OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u572856\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u7684ImageNet\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u57288\u4e2aOOD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ID\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0eOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u521d\u671f\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a81\u7834\u57fa\u51c6\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u4e0eOOD\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u65e0\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d7\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651OOD\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u8ffd\u6c42ID\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3002"}}

While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible.

We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case.

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\\% without degrading performance on stronger requests.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate. Unusually, these actuators are also light-emitting, as a fraction of optical energy is transmitted through the membrane. These opto-mechanical actuators have many potential applications in tactile displays, human interface engineering, wearable computing, and other areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training.

We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines.

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u6062\u590d\u534f\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6545\u969c\u7ea7\u8054\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c42\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\u3001\u65e0\u9650\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a\u6d88\u606f\u5951\u7ea6\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u89c4\u8303\u5c42\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff09\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u9650\u5b9a\u5404\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u4ef2\u88c1\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u5c42\u51b3\u7b56\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1147%\u7684\u6545\u969c\u7ea7\u8054\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53472.3\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6307\u660e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify (\"Is this statement correct?\") versus attributed to a speaker (\"Is this speaker correct?\"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through co-design sessions (N=10), we elicited 69 disclosure designs and implemented four prototypes that visually disclose human-AI collaboration in journalism. We then ran a within-subjects lab study (N=32) to examine how disclosure visualizations (Textual, Role-based Timeline, Task-based Timeline, Chatbot) and collaboration ratios (Primarily Human vs. Primarily AI) influenced visualization perceptions, gaze patterns, and post-experience responses.

However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.\n  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models.

These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance.

However, discovering the salient graph patterns that form this structure is notoriously difficult for two reasons.

Defining meaningful noisy patterns and detecting them efficiently is a currently unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose to use well-ordered matrices as a tool to both define and effectively detect noisy patterns. Specifically, we represent a graph as its adjacency matrix and optimally order it using Moran's $I$. Standard graph patterns (cliques, bicliques, and stars) now translate to rectangular submatrices. Using Moran's $I$, we define a permitted level of noise for such patterns. A combination of exact algorithms and heuristics allows us to efficiently decompose the matrix into noisy patterns. We also introduce a novel motif simplification that visualizes noisy patterns while explicitly encoding the level of noise.

How do we select among them? Using validity, reliability, reproducibility, and replicability as guides, we explore the significance of: (1) model openness, (2) model footprint, (3) training data, and (4) model architectures and fine-tuning. While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance.

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present a study with 13 participants with upper-limb impairments, comparatively evaluating how participants collaborate with their copilot in human cooperation and partial automation.

Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality.

In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations.

Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a \"time-on-chat vs. exploration\" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information. Qualitative findings reveal tension between the copilot's Socratic approach and users' desire for efficiency.

Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bcd\u5143\u5206\u6570\u8868\u8c03\u6574\u89e3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u5ea6\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u90e8\u5c42\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93z\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5bf9\u6570\u51e0\u7387\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bcd\u5143\u5206\u6570\u8868\u6765\u504f\u79fb\u89e3\u7801\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5199\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u5f0f\u5ea6\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe47\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u534750\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors.

Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design.

While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa FAConvLSTM\uff08\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529bConvLSTM\uff09\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3aConvLSTM2D\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u95e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfConvLSTM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5143\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u6709\u9650\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea71\u00d71\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u5faa\u73af\u95e8\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u9053\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b2. \u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u5f20\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u5206\u652f\u548c\u6324\u538b\u6fc0\u52b1\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b3. \u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u9065\u76f8\u5173\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b4. \u4e13\u7528\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5934\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFAConvLSTM\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ConvLSTM\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "FAConvLSTM\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ConvLSTM\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

In nomadic, walk-and-talk learning, such as tours in makerspaces, these screens can distract learners from real-world objects, increasing extraneous cognitive load. HCI research lacks empirical comparisons of potential alternatives, such as robots with in-situ projection versus screen-based counterparts; little knowledge has been derived for designing such alternatives. We introduce ProjecTA, a semi-humanoid, gesture-capable TA that guides learners while projecting near-object overlays coordinated with speech and gestures.

However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "HOSL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u9636\u6b21\u7684\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e73\u8861\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u62b5\u6d88\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "HOSL\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u91c7\u7528\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u5047\u8ba1\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u5b58\u50a8\uff1b\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728OPT\u6a21\u578b\uff08125M\u548c1.3B\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u76846\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHOSL\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5ba2\u6237\u7aefGPU\u5185\u5b58\u8fbe3.7\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u4f4e0.20%-4.23%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u96f6\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe15.55%\u3002", "conclusion": "HOSL\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u9636\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u5c55\u540c\u6b65\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u8bfb\u5199\u52a8\u4f5c\u5916\u65b0\u589e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56db\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u7ec4\u3001\u7701\u7565\u548c\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5ef6\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5\u542b\u8bfb\u5199\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u7ec4\u3001\u7701\u7565\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u540c\u6b65\u7ffb\u8bd1\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56db\u7c7b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1a\u53e5\u5b50\u5207\u5206\u3001\u5220\u9664\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u6982\u62ec\u548c\u4ee3\u8bcd\u5316\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u8003\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u65f6\u5ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684TTS\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u82f1\u6c49\u3001\u82f1\u5fb7\u3001\u82f1\u65e5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u53c2\u8003\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff1b\u5220\u9664\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u5207\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u5728\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7ffb\u8bd1\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u673a\u53e3\u8bd1\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Mimicry-Discovery Cycle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u5ffd\u89c6\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u4e2d\u6613\u7528\u7684\u725b\u987f\u516c\u5f0f\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4ec5\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u611f", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u30022) \u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u4e3aMimicry-Discovery Cycle\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u5730\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5PhysRVGBench\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86transformer\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u548cMDcycle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u611f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f"}}

While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules.

However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGD\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u79bb\u5f00\u5c16\u9510\u4f4e\u8c37\u3001\u8f6c\u5411\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u77ac\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u6700\u7ec8\u7a33\u5b9a\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SGD\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SGD\uff09\u4e3a\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u5e73\u5766\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6839\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aSGD\u9009\u62e9\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790SGD\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eSGD\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u91cd\u5851\u666f\u89c2\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u91cf\u58c1\u5792\u589e\u957f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77ac\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u51bb\u7ed3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0SGD\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u6682\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u53cd\u590d\u9003\u79bb\u5c16\u9510\u4f4e\u8c37\u5e76\u8f6c\u5411\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eSGD\u566a\u58f0\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u80fd\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u77ac\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u589e\u5927\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u58c1\u5792\u4f1a\u6291\u5236\u5c71\u8c37\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u56f0\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u76c6\u5730\u4e2d\uff1b\u63d0\u9ad8SGD\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u53ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5411\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3SGD\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts.

In this paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing sociotechnical challenges of machine learning grounded in qualitative fieldwork, a review of longitudinal deployment studies, and co-design workshops with healthcare and social welfare practitioners. The framework comprises (1) a categorization of eleven sociotechnical challenges organized along an ML-enabled care pathway, and (2) a process-oriented account of the conditions through which these challenges emerge across design and use. By providing a parsimonious vocabulary and an explanatory lens focused on practice, this work supports more precise analysis of how machine learning tools function and malfunction within real-world care delivery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3ML\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7167\u62a4\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u793e\u4f1a\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u6216\u6280\u672f\u7ea6\u675f\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u6027\u5b9e\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u7eb5\u5411\u90e8\u7f72\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u793e\u5de5\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u7c7b11\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u7ea6\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u4f53\u7cfb\u548c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5206\u6790ML\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7167\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u969c\u788d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u9886\u57df\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MGF-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5143\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u505c\u7535\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5173\u952e\u8d1f\u8377\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u53d1\u7535\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4f7f\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u505c\u7535\u914d\u7f6e\u6216\u53d1\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "MGF-RL\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u505c\u7535\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5c31\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEEE 13\u603b\u7ebf\u548cIEEE 123\u603b\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMGF-RL\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eMAML\u7684\u5143RL\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u505c\u7535\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRL\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "MGF-RL\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u5176\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8377\u6062\u590d\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections.

However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains.

Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them.

To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIGA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u56fe\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVIGA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u7684\u7f16\u5199-\u8fd0\u884c-\u6e32\u67d3-\u6bd4\u8f83-\u4fee\u8ba2\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u767d\u4e16\u754c\u5f00\u59cb\u91cd\u6784\u6216\u7f16\u8f91\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u66ff\uff09\u548c\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6e32\u67d3\u5386\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVIGA\u5728BlenderGym\uff08\u63d0\u534735.32%\uff09\u548cSlideBench\uff08\u63d0\u5347117.17%\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5728BlenderBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347124.70%\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u5f15\u64ce\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VIGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u56fe\u5f62\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u59823D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f02\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region.

Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window.

However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543).

While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods.

While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged.

Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Integrity Shield\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u6c34\u5370\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30PDF\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLMs)\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u7b54\u8003\u8bd5\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89c6\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e0a\u4f20\u7684PDF\u8003\u8bd5\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u89e3\u7b54\u6574\u4e2a\u8003\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u548c\u6210\u7ee9\u8bc1\u4e66\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u6216\u5047\u8bbe\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e13\u6709\u9ed1\u76d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u65e0\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Integrity Shield\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u6c34\u5370\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30PDF\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5f0f\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u7684\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89c6\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6c34\u5370\u80fd\u591f\u9632\u6b62MLLMs\u56de\u7b54\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u8003\u8bd5PDF\uff0c\u5e76\u7f16\u7801\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u7b7e\u540d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5b66\u751f\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u572830\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d6STEM\u3001\u4eba\u6587\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cIntegrity Shield\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u9632\u6548\u679c(91-94%\u7684\u8003\u8bd5\u7ea7\u522b\u963b\u6b62)\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027(89-93%\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u68c0\u7d22)\uff0c\u8de8\u8d8a\u56db\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1aMLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "Integrity Shield\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u7b54PDF\u8003\u8bd5\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u8bda\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u6c34\u5370\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u9884\u9632\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fdd\u969c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.\n  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.\n  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs.

We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content.

Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks.

Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types.

To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches.

While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research.

In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity.

Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact.

Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image.

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues.

We propose \\textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines.

Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u5145\u8db3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u975e\u8ba1\u5212\u6027\u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u65ad\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u7ef4\u4fee\u8d39\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1) \u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u5e38\u548c\u6545\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u793a\u4f8b\uff1b2) \u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5065\u5eb7\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5e38\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u6545\u969c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u53d1\u52a8\u673a\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u9700\u6545\u969c\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5e94\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6298\u8877\u3002"}}

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation.

Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\u03ba$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\u03ba$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt\u03ba m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrt\u03ba$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(\u03ba^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\u03ba^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features.

By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "WetSAM\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684SAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e7f\u5730\u7cbe\u786e\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e7f\u5730\u5236\u56fe\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5355\u65f6\u76f8\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff1bSAM\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6e7f\u5730\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWetSAM\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSAM\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u65f6\u5e8f\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u652f\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u6e7f\u5730\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7269\u5019\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u533a\u57df\u751f\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b\u53cc\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u7ea65000km\u00b2\u7684\u5168\u7403\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cWetSAM\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1-score\u8fbe85.58%\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e7f\u5730\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "WetSAM\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6e7f\u5730\u5236\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences.

While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics.

Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions.

Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns.

We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $\u0394\\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \\in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge.

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms.

Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation.

First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation.

Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 \"disagreement\" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection.

Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency.

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A Brief Empirical Analysis of Tokenizers", "comment": null, "summary": "Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic.

UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR.

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05.

While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation.

Code: https://github.com/rarazafin/score_diffusion_ensemble", "summary": "Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging.

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\\mathrm{Re}\\approx2\\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain.

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
