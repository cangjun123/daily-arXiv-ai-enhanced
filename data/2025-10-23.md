*Xueqi Ma,Yanbei Jiang,Sarah Erfani,James Bailey,Weifeng Liu,Krista A. Ehinger,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PICK框架，该框架结合多层次分析与知识注入，提升了多模态语言模型在心理分析中的应用，特别是在HTP测试中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多模态大型语言模型在心理分析中的应用，尤其是情感丰富的领域

Method: 通过分解绘画为语义上有意义的子绘图，构建分层表示，并使用强化学习训练的特征提取模块，生成心理特征画像，最终集成多维度信息以进行心理评估。

Result: 提出了PICK框架，显著提升了多模态大型语言模型在心理分析中的能力，并验证了其作为通用框架的有效性

Conclusion: PICK框架为理解人类心理状态提供了结构化和可解释的方案，能够有效整合多方面的信息以符合专家级推理。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

### [2] [A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559)
*Nidham Tekaya,Manuela Waldner,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估VLM对时间意识的能力，提出TIME10k数据集和时间线表示方法，旨在提升时序推理的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在时间信息理解方面的能力，以提升其在时序推理任务中的表现。

Method: 通过构建TIME10k数据集和创新评估方法，分析37个VLM的时间意识，并在嵌入空间中建立时间线表示。

Result: 提出了TIME10k数据集，并通过新方法评估了37个VLM的时间意识，发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈现低维度非线性结构。

Conclusion: 提出的时间线方法在准确性和计算效率上优于传统的基于提示的方法。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文综述了降维技术在遥感数据处理中的重要性，并提出未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着地球观测数据量的不断增长，自动化信息采集变得尤为重要，以应对社会、经济和环境挑战。

Method: 文献综述

Result: 探讨了降维技术及其在遥感数据中的应用，识别了未被充分研究的降维算法机遇。

Conclusion: 降维技术为提高遥感数据处理效率和效果提供了有力支持，未来需要进一步探索其算法和应用。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段的视觉-语言问答系统，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强，在自动驾驶问答任务中取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够回答高层次感知、预测和规划问题的自动驾驶视觉-语言问答系统，以提高自动驾驶系统的决策能力和可靠性。

Method: 第一阶段使用一个大型多模态LLM，并通过自一致性集合提升答案可靠性；第二阶段通过nuScenes场景元数据和类别特定的提示信息进行增强。

Result: 在驾驶问答基准测试中，该方法显著优于基线Qwen2.5模型，取得了高达67.37%的整体准确率，并在视觉干扰严重情况下保持96%的准确率。

Conclusion: 经过精心设计的提示和上下文增强可以显著提升预训练视觉-语言模型在高层次自动驾驶问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种新型的时间感知状态空间模型，旨在提高纵向医学成像的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在不规则时间间隔内建模高分辨率序列图像的挑战，以充分利用空间和时间信息。

Conclusion: 该模型展示了在处理复杂患者筛查历史时的高效性，为纵向图像分析建立了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

Result: 通过在多个数据集和用户研究中进行实证评估，该方法在生成视频的物理合理性和文本一致性上均显示出显著改善。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持文本提示一致性方面显著提高了视频生成模型的物理常识性。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

Conclusion: UniHPR有效地对齐了跨模态的人体姿态表示，并在相关任务上展示了出色的性能，推动了人体姿态估计的研究。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Conclusion: 整合注意力机制的3D U-Net模型有效改善了脑肿瘤分割的表现，具有较高的临床诊断可靠性。

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Result: 研究结果表明，采用FedProx方法可在保护患者隐私的同时提升肿瘤分割的准确性。

Conclusion: FedProx方法在非独立同分布的数据集上成功训练出96%准确率的全球模型，显示出良好的肿瘤分割能力。

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究团队战术如何从个体玩家的视角和他们对队友意图的预测、解释和适应能力中产生，尤其在电子竞技等复杂环境中，现有方法多集中于第三人称视角。

Method: 通过收集多个玩家的第一人称视角视频流，开发CECL方法，通过对齐队友的视觉流来提升战术情境意识。

Result: 提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning（CECL）方法，推动了多智能体决策和战术理解的研究。

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电子竞技中的跨视角多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，拓展了人类-人工智能协作和时空推理的研究领域。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Conclusion: PruneHal是一种简单有效的方法，无需额外训练，能够提升模型对关键视觉信息的注意力，从而减轻幻觉现象，并在多个基准上显示出优越性。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 传统的奖励函数对视频生成的时间一致性关注不足，本研究旨在提升生成视频的整体质量，特别是时间一致性。

Method: 通过引入视频一致性距离（VCD）指标，利用频域分析技术进行模型的奖励微调。

Result: 本文提出了一种基于奖励的微调视频扩散模型的新方法，通过引入视频一致性距离（VCD）指标，显著提高了生成视频的时间一致性。VCD专注于频域分析，从而在图像到视频生成任务中更有效地捕获帧信息，解决了传统奖励函数在视频序列质量上的局限性。实验结果表明，与传统方法相比，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型在保持其他性能的同时，大大增强了时间一致性。

Conclusion: 使用视频一致性距离（VCD）可以有效提升生成视频的时间一致性，且不会降低其他性能。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MoE-GS的框架，通过整合多个专家和体积感知像素路由提高动态场景重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景下性能不一致的问题。

Method: 提出了Mixture of Experts的动态高斯样条框架，结合了单次多专家渲染和门控感知高斯剪枝等方法。

Result: MoE-GS在N3V和Technicolor数据集上的实验结果表明，表现优于当前最先进的方法，且效率得到提升。

Conclusion: MoE-GS框架在保持渲染质量的同时，通过多种策略实现了更高的效率，展示了其在动态高斯点云重建中的优越性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/w/MoE-GS-68BA/.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

Result: 在模拟和现实世界基准测试中，FadeLead在不同带宽设置下均表现优越。

Conclusion: FadeLead在多种带宽设置下均优于现有方法，证明了丰富背景信息的前景特征共享的有效性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 所提方法有效提升了图像的结构完整性和真实感，是一种高效的超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning
strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from
true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future

Method: 提出了一种统一的强化和模仿学习(RIL)算法，结合了强化学习和对抗模仿学习的优势。

Result: 通过RIL算法，学生模型能够模仿大型教师模型的文本生成能力，利用强化信号不断提升其生成能力。

Conclusion: RIL算法显著缩小了轻量级视觉语言模型与顶尖模型之间的性能差距，并在某些情况下超越了它们。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Motivation: 在面对日益严峻的气候和人类活动压力的浅水环境中，准确、详细且定期更新的海底地形图及复杂语义内容至关重要。但现有方法将深度或海底分类单独处理，无法充分发挥其相互作用的优势。

Method: 利用双分支编码器进行深度估计和海底分类，通过注意力特征融合模块与窗口化Swin-Transformer融合块实现跨任务特征整合，并通过动态任务不确定性加权平衡目标。

Conclusion: 联合建模深度与基质和海底栖息地可以实现协同增益，提供了一个稳健的集成解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 研究强调了规模偏移在领域泛化中的重要性，提出了Scale Shift Domain Generalization的研究方向。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了CLIP中间层的丰富对象信息，未能与大脑的功能层次相一致，导致图像解码效果不佳。

Method: 通过多层融合方法，BrainMCLIP结合了人类视觉系统的功能层次，消除了对单独VAE路径的需求。

Result: 实验结果显示，BrainMCLIP在高层语义指标方面表现优异，并在参数上减少了71.7%。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP exhibits superior performance in decoding fMRI images, achieving high-level semantic accuracy with fewer parameters, and effectively utilizing intermediate CLIP features.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在开放词汇图像分割和物体识别任务中表现出色，展示了其有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

Conclusion: AegisRF能够在多种下游任务中有效保护NeRF模型的知识产权，同时维持高视觉质量。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench 为评估和推进空间基础的 VLMs 和 VLA 提供了标准化的评估协议和数据资源，有助于加速相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Motivation: 随着电子商务的发展，提高仓库操作效率变得至关重要，数字双胞胎的应用为此提供了新的思路。

Method: 使用19台宽角摄像头从天花板观察地面，进行位置追踪并通过对脚部位置进行图像对齐来减少失真。

Result: 本文探讨了在电子商务快速发展的背景下，物流市场的扩大以及改善仓库运营效率的必要性。研究重点是利用19台安装在仓库天花板上的广角摄像头进行员工定位追踪。通过基于地面表面的对齐方法，克服了广角摄像头在图像边缘的显著失真，尤其是垂直方向的失真，从而提高了追踪准确性超过20%。

Conclusion: 通过对齐方法和特征比较，有效提升了工人追踪的准确性，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 在实际的集成电路缺陷分类任务中应用深度分类技术和自动光学检测模型面临挑战，主要因真实世界数据分布的高度不平衡和类别属性的复杂性。

Method: 使用多专家分类框架，整合区域通道注意力模块、度量学习损失、硬类别挖掘策略和知识蒸馏过程。

Result: 提出了IC-Defect-14数据集及ReCAME-Net模型，解决了深度学习在高度不平衡缺陷数据中的分类难题。

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net在IC-Defect-14数据集上优于之前的模型，同时在一般公共数据集上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了通过预测先验信息，可以有效加速MRI成像，提升重建图像质量。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像中由于云层等因素导致的系统性缺失像素问题，以减少自动特征提取模型中的表示偏差。

Method: 通过多重插补方法和加权重采样方案来解决标签与覆盖率之间的依赖性。

Result: 经过插补和重采样，两者均显著降低了表示偏差，同时保证了平衡准确率、精确度和召回率。

Conclusion: 去偏差模型在低覆盖图像中探测气体羽流的效果显著提升。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Result: Cauvis方法在SDGOD数据集上表现出优越性，相较于现有领域泛化方法提高了15.9-31.4%的性能，并在复杂干扰环境中显示出显著的鲁棒性优势。

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效应对域偏差和伪特征纠缠问题，提升了模型对于未见目标域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: CARES是一种轻量级预处理模块，能够根据图像-查询对预测最小的输入分辨率，从而在保持任务性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在各种任务中的广泛应用，处理图像时需要保持高分辨率以保持有效性，但这会导致计算量和延迟增加，因此需要找到一种方法来优化输入分辨率。

Method: CARES利用一个紧凑的视觉语言模型提取特征，并通过离散分类器训练在不同分辨率下的输出。推理时，它能够在连续分辨率间进行插值，以实现更精细的控制。

Result: CARES模块在任务性能不降低的情况下，能够将计算量减少多达80%。

Conclusion: CARES通过预测最小有效输入分辨率，成功实现了计算降低和性能保持，适用于多种视觉语言任务。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Result: 实验表明PoseCrafter在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的表现显著提升，尤其是在小重叠图像对的场景中。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter在小重叠图像对的相机姿态估计中表现显著优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Conclusion: 通过针对性的训练，仅对输出层进行微调，可以提高视觉语言模型在计数任务上的准确性，最多可提高21%。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 提示复杂性对合成数据的影响需要进一步研究，尽管提高复杂性可以减少合成与真实数据之间的分布差异，但同时却可能降低生成数据的一致性和多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Motivation: 在高速度运动、高动态范围环境及动态背景干扰下提高物体追踪效果

Method: 提出了分层非对称蒸馏(HAD)框架

Result: HAD在多个实验中始终超越了现有的最先进方法，并通过消融研究验证了各组件的有效性和必要性

Conclusion: HAD有效地解决了不同成像机制间的时空不对称性，为多模态整合提供了一种有效的方法。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 研究发现视频感知系统在处理alpha通道时存在安全漏洞，亟需发展针对性的防御措施。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Conclusion: VGD方法在保证几何一致性和渲染质量方面表现优越，适用于自主驾驶场景重建。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Conclusion: 研究结果显示，该框架在单模态推理场景下，针对多种EO应用展示了优于现有技术的方法的一致预测改进。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对传统光学镜头的景深限制及多焦点图像融合领域所面临的多重挑战，如数据稀缺和合成数据与现实场景之间的差距。

Method: 通过蒸馏变分自编码器和一个强大的融合模块，同时处理多达七张图像以提升融合效果。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的多焦点图像融合方法VAEEDOF，解决了光学镜头的景深限制。尽管传统和深度学习方法已有所进展，但仍面临训练数据有限、合成数据集的领域差异以及缺乏信息区域的困难。VAEEDOF采用蒸馏变分自编码器以实现高保真、高效的图像重建，融合模块可以同时处理多达七张图像，增强了在不同焦点下的鲁棒性。为了解决数据稀缺问题，本文引入了新的合成4K数据集MattingMFIF，模拟了真实照片的景深效果。方法达到最先进的结果，生成无缝无伪影的融合图像，缩小合成和真实场景之间的差距，为复杂的多焦点图像融合挑战提供了重要的突破。

Conclusion: VAEEDOF在多焦点图像融合领域取得了显著进展，生成高质量、无伪影的图像，并成功缩小了合成与真实场景之间的差距。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统纸质 ECG 转换为可用于现代自动化诊断的数字信号，以应对大量存在于纸上的 ECG 的问题。

Method: 使用了一种全自动的框架，通过处理扫描或拍摄的 ECG 图像，将其转换为数字信号，并在多个数据集上进行了验证和评估。

Result: 提出了一种全自动、模块化的框架，经过广泛验证，并在各个子类别中优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该软件的开放源代码将促进重现性和进一步开发，帮助解锁历史 ECG 档案，促进 AI 驱动的诊断的获取。

Abstract: Millions of clinical ECGs exist only as paper scans, making them unusable for
modern automated diagnostics. We introduce a fully automated, modular framework
that converts scanned or photographed ECGs into digital signals, suitable for
both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191
ECG images with 1,596 collected at Akershus University Hospital, where the
algorithm obtains a mean signal-to-noise ratio of 19.65 dB on scanned papers
with common artifacts. It is further evaluated on the Emory Paper Digitization
ECG Dataset, comprising 35,595 images, including images with perspective
distortion, wrinkles, and stains. The model improves on the state-of-the-art in
all subcategories. The full software is released as open-source, promoting
reproducibility and further development. We hope the software will contribute
to unlocking retrospective ECG archives and democratize access to AI-driven

### [44] [CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597)
*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff模型通过生成多个多样化的定位图，提供更可靠的图像篡改检测，超越了现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像取证领域，准确识别图像中受操纵或篡改区域的像素级别非常关键。现有方法通常生成单一的确定性定位图，缺乏高精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用的需求。

Method: CBDiff通过引入伯努利噪声到扩散过程中，并使用时间步骤交叉注意力（TSCAttention）结合语义特征指导，增强操控检测的能力。

Result: 提出了一种先进的条件伯努利扩散模型（CBDiff），能够生成多个多样化且合理的定位图，从而提供更丰富和全面的篡改分布表示。

Conclusion: CBDiff在八个公开基准数据集上的大量实验中表现出显著优于现有最先进方法的能力，展示了其在实际应用中的强大潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

*Haozhe Luo,Shelley Zixin Shu,Ziyu Zhou,Sebastian Otalora,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了视觉语言模型在胸部X光图像中的可解释性，发现其对小病变的定位能力不足，并提出需对模型进行可解释性基准测试以保证临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，深入探讨其文本概念与视觉证据之间的一致性变得尤为重要，以支持临床应用和可解释性。

Method: 通过生成交叉注意力和基于相似性的定位图，定量评估了模型与放射科医生标注区域之间的对齐程度。

Result: 本研究系统性评估了七种基于CLIP风格的视觉语言模型在胸部X光图像理解中的跨模态可解释性。通过生成视觉解释并量化其与放射科医生标注区域的一致性，发现当前的视觉语言模型虽然在识别大病变方面表现良好，但在小或弥漫性病变的定位能力上表现不足。此外，针对胸部X光特定数据集预训练的模型在可解释性方面优于通用领域数据集的模型。此外，模型的总识别能力与其对视觉证据的可靠性存在很强的相关性。这些发现强调了现有视觉语言模型在临床可靠性方面依然存在不足，并突显了在医疗实践中使用前需要进行针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在胸部X光成像中的强识别能力并未转化为可靠的临床可解释性，因此在医疗实践应用前需要进行更严格的可解释性评估。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

*Junfei Zhou,Penglin Dai,Quanmin Wei,Bingyi Liu,Xiao Wu,Jianping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的GenComm机制，旨在通过特征生成解决异构多智能体系统之间的感知挑战，同时在集成新智能体时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于适应和重建的方法在异构协作中由于传感器和模型差异导致的领域间隙问题以及高计算成本。

Method: 提出了一种新的生成通信机制（GenComm），通过特征生成来实现异构多智能体系统之间的无缝感知。

Result: GenComm在集成新智能体时，在计算成本和参数数量上减少了81%。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，GenComm在性能和效率上均优于现有方法，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零外部依赖的增强时刻检索框架AMR，旨在克服现有方法的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义判别不足等瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法在数据稀缺、边界不明确及语义区分不足等方面存在显著瓶颈。

Method: 通过两阶段训练框架，先进行课程学习以建立基础的边界和语义意识，然后采用双查询集进行蒸馏适应。

Result: AMR显著提高了时刻检索的性能，更好地处理了边界和语义的歧义问题。

Conclusion: AMR在多个基准测试中表现优于现有最先进的方法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗领域通用视觉语言模型表现不佳的问题，尤其是在缺乏高质量医学影像数据集和粗到细的诊断过程方面。

Method: 提出了MedReason-R1模型，结合了区域兴趣嵌入和GRPO强化学习框架，增强了推理能力。

Result: 在CT疾病诊断任务中，MedReason-R1超越了现有的医疗和通用视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中实现了最先进的表现，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS方法解决了3D高斯分裂在复杂场景中产生过度重建伪影的问题，显著提升了光线合成的质量和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯分裂在复杂场景中表现不佳的根本原因，特别是过度重建伪影问题。

Method: 提出基于重激活原则的ReAct-GS方法，引入了重要性导向的密集化标准和重激活机制。

Result: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)在实时光线合成中表现出色，但在复杂场景中由于过度重建伪影（如局部模糊和针形失真）而面临挑战。传统方法认为这些问题是由于大规模高斯的划分不足所致，而我们认为其根本原因有两点：在密集化过程中梯度幅度稀释，以及重要高斯在复杂区域被冻结现象，同时次优的高斯被困在局部最优中。为解决这些挑战，我们提出了基于重激活原则的ReAct-GS方法，包含：1）利用多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域的原始高斯生长的重视密集化标准；2）通过自适应参数扰动来复苏被冻结的原始高斯的重激活机制。大量实验表明，ReAct-GS可以有效消除过度重建伪影，在标准的光线合成指标上达到最先进的性能，同时保留复杂的几何细节。此外，我们的重激活机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）结合时，均展现出一致的提升，表明其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS有效克服了复杂场景中的伪影问题，实现了光线合成的高质量与高性能，同时适用于其他相关方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Method: 提出了一种策略世界模型（PWM），结合了世界建模与轨迹规划，并采用了一种无动作的未来状态预测机制和动态增强的并行令牌生成机制。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的驾驶范式，称为策略世界模型（PWM），它将世界建模和轨迹规划整合在一个统一的架构中，并通过无动作的未来状态预测方案利用学习到的世界知识来增强规划能力。PWM通过协作状态-动作预测，模拟类似人类的预期感知，从而实现更可靠的规划性能。此外，文章还引入了一种动态增强的并行令牌生成机制，以提高视频预测的效率。尽管仅使用前置摄像头输入，所提方法的性能与依赖多视角和多模态输入的先进方法相当或超越。

Conclusion: 策略世界模型在仅依赖前置摄像头输入的情况下，能够有效融合世界建模与轨迹规划，展现出优于或等于现有多视角输入的先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Motivation为了解MLLMs的视觉处理机制，并探索其感知能力与人类之间的相似性，提出视觉搜索作为一个有效的评估工具。

Method: 我们借用经典的视觉搜索范式，通过控制实验评估MLLMs在颜色、大小和光照特征下的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，MLLMs在颜色和大小的基于单一特征的搜索中显示出类人跳跃效应，并在多特征搜索中有能力限制，同时验证了它们如何利用自然场景先验信息。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，MLLMs在视觉处理方面可以通过经典的视觉搜索范式进行有效评估，展现出人类相似的感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术常扭曲微小曲线结构，影响医学成像中的诊断可靠性和定量分析，特别是在眼科和血管成像中，细微形态变化具有重要的临床意义。

Method: 将曲线结构提取模块整合进基线模型，进行拓扑监督，从而在无配对翻译过程中明确保护细微曲线结构。

Result: CST在三种影像模态下的综合评估显示，其提高了翻译的保真度，并在CycleGAN和UNSB上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CST通过强化几何完整性，在医学影像的跨域转换中开辟了一条遵循曲线结构意识的原则性路径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Motivation: 提高深度学习（DL）面部展示攻击检测（PAD）系统的可解释性，以理解其决策依据

Method: 提出了一种名为Ensemble-CAM的新技术

Result: 通过可视化解释提升了面部PAD系统的透明度和可信度

Conclusion: 通过提供视觉解释，该技术改善了DL基础的面部PAD系统的行为理解，以及增强了系统的信任度。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

TL;DR: LyTimeT是一种提取动态变量的框架，通过空间-时间注意力和稳定性约束改进了视频预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取高维视频中的真实动态变量面临背景干扰等挑战，需发展更鲁棒与可解释的模型。

Method: LyTimeT框架分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用基于TimeSformer的自编码器提取鲁棒的潜在状态，第二阶段通过线性相关分析和Lyapunov稳定性正则化优化动态转移。

Result: LyTimeT是一个两阶段框架，用于从高维视频中提取动态变量，能够应对背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰因素。在第一阶段，LyTimeT使用基于时间变换器的自编码器，利用全局注意力集中于动态相关区域，学习鲁棒的潜在状态并进行准确的长期视频预测。在第二阶段，通过线性相关分析探测学习到的潜在空间，选择物理意义最强的维度，并使用Lyapunov基的稳定性正则化来完善转移动态，减少错误累积。实验表明，LyTimeT在多个合成基准和真实动态系统中具有较高的预测准确性和物理可解释性。

Conclusion: 结合空间-时间注意力与稳定性约束，LyTimeT在动态变量提取和预测任务中表现优异，兼具准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K 是一个大规模、高质量的图像编辑数据集，为下一代文本引导图像编辑模型的训练和基准测试奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了单目深度估计评估指标的不足，并提出了一种新指标与可视化工具来提高评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计领域缺乏标准化的评估方法，且现有的评估指标在不同情况下的表现尚不明确。

Method: 进行现有评估指标的定量分析，关注其对地面真实值不同类型扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较。

Result: 发现现有评估指标在处理曲率扰动时严重缺乏敏感性，进而提出一种基于相对表面法线的新评估指标，以及新深度可视化工具和创建复合指标的方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的评估指标与工具，提升了单目深度估计的评估精度与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity

current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖于两步过程，效率低且效果差，推动了本研究的开展。

Result: 在基准数据集上评估后，与多个基础模型相比，新模型在性能上具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该模型在出域数据集上表现出色，达到最新的性能水平。

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

TL;DR: MiniLM为地球科学文献提供了一种高效、低成本的信息检索方法，展示了在多个应用领域的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大型语言模型（LLMs）在科学文献中的应用与潜在问题，旨在探索一种精确、快速且成本低的信息检索方法。

Method: 建立了一个基于小型语言模型（MiniLM）的信息检索框架，通过语义搜索和句子级索引进行高效信息提取。

Result: MiniLM通过分析情感语调和主题聚类，成为追踪领域动态与研究优先级的强大工具，能处理大量专家验证的信息。

Conclusion: MiniLM在地球科学领域具有重要应用潜力，能够高效提取信息，追踪学术进展与问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型被广泛部署，但系统评估其指令遵循能力仍面临挑战，需要新的评估方法来判断实际能力。

Method: 构建了一个精简的评估框架，通过20个精心设计的提示评估大型语言模型的指令遵循能力，涵盖多样的任务类别。

Result: 在2025年10月14日进行的大规模实证研究中，我们测试了331个模型中的256个，通过验证每个模型的基本功能以确保方法学的严谨性。

Conclusion: 本研究为当前大型语言模型的指令遵循能力提供了一种实用的评估工具，并进行了一项全面的实证分析，揭示了模型在不同任务中的共性和特定挑战。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在低资源语言翻译中，如何提升翻译质量，特别是Bengali到Sylheti的翻译

Method: 对多语言Transformer模型进行微调并与零-shot大语言模型进行比较。

Result: 微调后的多语言Transformer模型显著优于零-shot大语言模型

Conclusion: 微调模型在低资源语言翻译中表现更佳，强调了适应性的重要性，有助于推动语言技术的包容性发展。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

TL;DR: 通过微调编码器的SLM模型，本文在多语言文本和代码检测中实现了更高的准确率和更低的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在多语言文本和源代码生成中，机器生成内容的检测器面临准确性和效率的挑战。

Method: 采用预训练的RoBERTA和CodeBERTa模型进行微调，并使用专门的数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 微调编码器仅的小型语言模型(SLM)在二分类任务中显著优于大型语言模型(LLM)，同时计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 微调的SLM模型在性能上优于现有的LLM，同时在计算效率上具备显著优势。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase通过将社交媒体短文本进行重新表述来改善主题建模的效果，特别是在公共卫生相关的社交媒体分析中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台提供丰富的数据用于分析公共话语，尤其是在危机期间，但社交媒体短文本的简短性、非正式性和噪声常常影响传统主题建模的有效性。

Method: 开发了TM-Rephrase框架，利用大语言模型对原始推文进行标准化和正式化的重新表述，以提升后续的主题建模效果。

Result: 研究表明，TM-Rephrase提高了多个主题建模方法的主题一致性、独特性和多样性，同时减少了主题冗余，尤其是在LDA算法中效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，重新表述策略能够有效提高主题建模的表现，对公共卫生危机及其他重要领域的公共话语理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

TL;DR: ODiS算法通过考虑多个维度的评估，结合主成分分析，确保在数据选择中保持质量和多样性，从而提升大规模语言模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的高质量预训练数据对其性能至关重要，但现有的评分选择方法在确保数据多样性方面存在缺陷，导致性能下降。

Method: ODiS算法通过多维度评估数据，使用主成分分析去相关各维度，训练Roberta模型进行数据回归，并在每个正交维度中选择顶尖数据。

Result: 提出了一种新的ODiS算法，能够在数据选择过程中同时保持质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 经过ODiS选择的数据展示了较少的维度重叠，且模型在下游基准测试中表现明显优于其他基线，强调了正交和多样化数据选择的必要性。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法在对话环境变化时缺乏适应性，导致模型的公平性和一致性下降。

Method: 动态、可逆的剪枝框架，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，并应用自适应遮罩调节其影响。

Result: 提出了一种在推理时提供细粒度、内存感知的减轻措施的方法，保持了知识的完整性，增强了多语言单轮和多轮对话的连贯性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在实际对话中实现动态公平控制，提升语言模型的表现和适应性。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在线平台上虚假信息的快速传播削弱了人们之间的信任，并妨碍了知情决策。

Method: 使用基于变压器的预训练语言模型（PLMs）检测虚假信息，采用两步优化策略对RoBERTa和DistilBERT进行调优，并集成LIME和SHAP实现可解释性。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop这两个真实世界基准数据集上进行测试，DistilBERT在准确性上可与RoBERTa媲美，同时需要更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: PLM结合合理的微调和可解释性，可以成为一种有效的可扩展、值得信赖的虚假信息检测框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance

are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了一个新的对话数据集SCRIPTS，评估大型语言模型在推断人际关系方面的社会推理能力，发现其表现有限，尤其在韩语中，强调需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在人与人工智能交互中的应用增加，评估其在社交推理方面的能力变得至关重要。

Method: 引入SCRIPTS数据集，通过评估模型在对话中推断说话者人际关系的能力来测试模型的社会推理能力。

Result: 在对九个模型的评估中，当前的专有大型语言模型在英语数据集上取得75-80%的成绩，而在韩语上的表现仅为58-69%。模型在其响应中选择不太可能的关系占10-25%。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型在社会推理能力方面存在显著局限，亟需开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

Motivation: 针对现有心理健康支持工具的局限性，提出新的基准工具，提升对大型语言模型的评价方法，以促进其在心理健康领域的应用。

Method: 采用综合性的数据集和统计方法，通过对比高效LLM评审者与人类专家的评分，分析其一致性、可靠性和偏差。

Result: 本研究旨在评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理健康支持中的有效性，面对治疗对话的情感和认知复杂性，现有基准在规模和可靠性上都较为有限。为此，研究者们引入了两个基准工具：MentalBench-100k和MentalAlign-70k，前者整合了10,000个来自真实场景的数据对话和LLM生成的响应，后者则通过评估四种高效LLM评审者与人类专家在70,000个评分上的表现，采用了情感与认知一致性框架进行数据分析。分析结果显示，LLM评审者在认知属性如指导和信息性上表现可靠，但在同情心和安全性等方面存在不可靠性。总体而言，本研究为LLM在心理健康领域的评估提供了新的方法论和实证基础，并将基准和代码发布。

Conclusion: 本研究为心理健康领域内大型语言模型的可靠性评估奠定了新的方法论和经验基础。

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大语言模型在生物医学术语规范化中的表现，发现术语类型对模型的记忆和泛化能力有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的生物医学数据集成依赖于自动化术语规范化，即将自然语言生物医学术语映射到标准化标识符。这一过程对于语义互操作性至关重要。

Method: 通过微调Llama 3.1 8B模型，评估了不同生物医学本体的术语映射表现，并进行了基线准确性和嵌入分析。

Result: 对多种生物医学本体的记忆能力（训练术语表现）和泛化能力（验证术语表现）进行了评估，发现不同术语表现显著不同。

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了一个预测框架，帮助理解在何种情况下微调能够增强事实回忆能力，以及在稀疏或非词汇化标识符的情况下为何会失败。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Method: 通过构建和解释知识冲突的框架，进行代码生成的实验和评估。

Result: 发现足够大的语言模型能够在其参数中编码知识冲突的概念，实现高达80.65%的准确率来检测知识冲突，同时采用激活级别引导可获得最多12.6%的成功引导提升。

Conclusion: 模型的有效性依赖于模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡，实验代码和数据将在接受后公开。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大型语言模型中，区分事实推理与幻觉仍然具有挑战性，因此需要一种新的分析框架来理解模型行为。

Method: 建立光谱分析框架，通过图信号处理定义诊断指标，分析不同类型的幻觉和事实陈述的光谱特征。

Result: 实验证明，基于光谱特征的检测器实现了88.75%的准确率，高于75%的基于困惑度的基线，展示了光谱分析在实际应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: 光谱几何可能捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为大型语言模型中的幻觉检测提供了潜在框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

Motivation: 研究Transformer架构在多语言处理中的内部计算特征及其对性能的影响。

Method: 利用图信号处理技术分析注意力引起的标记图，从而跟踪在语音交替过程中代数连通性的变化。

Result: Phi-3-Mini表现出明显的英语特定早期层中断，而其他模型和语言的表现则有所不同，表明训练强调可能导致可检测的计算印记。

Conclusion: 不同的Transformer架构通过不同的连通模式实现相同的语言计算，且这些特征与模型的语言处理能力和架构偏见相关。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

Motivation: 现有的迭代提示方法效率低，导致生成可预测的标记序列，造成不必要的标记使用和不稳定的终止。

Result: TSSS在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上达到了最新的准确性，并在RAG-CoT方法中展现出竞争力的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS在效率受限的场景下（如设备内推理）表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

Method: 构建了evolveQA基准，通过分析三个真实时间戳数据集（AWS更新，Azure变更，WHO疾病爆发报告），生成针对不同知识截止日期的问题和答案。

Result: 通过evolveQA基准测试，发现12个开源和闭源的LLMs在处理动态演变知识时相比静态知识问题的性能显著下降，最高达31%。

Conclusion: evolveQA为评估大型语言模型在处理时间演变知识方面提供了有效工具，并揭示了其在这一领域的性能缺陷。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Result: 我们的表示和复合距离在多项NLP任务中持续提高了性能。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种新的方法，能够有效聚合语言距离信号，为多语种研究提供更有效的工具。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型中幻觉问题，提高检测流程的性能和可信性。

Method: 提出JointCQ框架，通过联合声明提取和查询生成，利用评估标准筛选训练数据并微调语言模型。

Result: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）常面临幻觉问题，即生成看似真实但实际上不可靠的内容。传统的幻觉检测流程包括响应分解、查询生成、证据收集和声明验证。然而，现有方法在前两个阶段存在局限性，如声明提取中的上下文丢失和查询生成的低特异性，导致幻觉检测流程的性能下降。本研究提出了JointCQ，一个联合声明和查询生成框架，旨在构建一个高效的声明-查询生成器。我们的框架利用精心设计的评估标准来筛选合成训练数据，并对语言模型进行微调，实现联合声明提取和查询生成，为下游的搜索和验证提供可靠和信息丰富的输入。实验结果表明，我们的方法在多个开放领域问答的幻觉检测基准上优于以前的方法，推动了更可信和透明的语言模型系统的目标。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，本研究提出的JointCQ框架在幻觉检测基准测试中效果优于现有方法，推动了语言模型系统的可信性和透明性。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their

acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

### [86] [HAD: HAllucination Detection Language Models Based on a Comprehensive Hallucination Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19318)
*Fan Xu,Xinyu Hu,Zhenghan Yu,Li Lin,Xu Zhang,Yang Zhang,Wei Zhou,Jinjie Gu,Xiaojun Wan*

TL;DR: 研究提出了HAllucination Detection模型（HAD），旨在检测和纠正NLG模型中的幻觉现象，并在多个任务中展示了优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对大语言模型依赖性的增加，幻觉现象的可靠性和准确性问题愈加突出，亟需开发有效的检测与纠正机制。

Method: 介绍了一种综合的幻觉分类法，提出HAD模型，结合幻觉检测和修正，经过大规模数据集训练。

Result: 本文介绍了一个关于自然语言生成（NLG）模型的研究，特别是针对模型产生虚假信息（即幻觉现象）的探讨。研究提出了一个全面的幻觉分类法，共分为11类，并提出了HAllucination Detection (HAD)模型，该模型整合了幻觉检测、跨度级别识别和纠正功能于一个推理过程中。HAD模型是在约90K的精细合成数据集上进行训练的，具有较强的通用性，可以应用于各种NLG任务。此外，研究还注释了一个用于幻觉检测的测试集HADTest，包含2,248个样本。评估结果表明，HAD模型在领域内和领域外的测试集上普遍优于现有基准，在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench上实现了最新的状态，证明了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: HAD模型在幻觉检测和纠正方面显示出卓越的能力，具备良好的通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的超体积优化策略，旨在通过强化学习优化大语言模型的多目标文本摘要生成，提高摘要的一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有的文本摘要生成中多目标优化的问题，提出对大语言模型进行强化学习的优化。同时，探索如何更好地平衡摘要的一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性。

Method: 通过引入超体积优化（HVO）策略，动态调整强化学习中的评分，逐步逼近帕累托前沿，以实现多目标摘要的平衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用HVO方法的模型在多个代表性摘要数据集上表现优于群体相对策略优化，并在不同维度上显示出更为均衡的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在多项摘要数据集上超越了现有的群体相对策略优化方法，且生成的摘要在多个目标上表现更为均衡，7B基础模型的表现与GPT-4相当，同时生成长度更短。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/ai4business-LiAuto/HVO.git

TL;DR: 提出将推理能力集成到语音大语言模型中以完成插槽填充任务，利用链式思维框架分解任务，创建推理数据集并进行有监督微调，显示推理步骤引入后性能提升，hybrid speechLLMs优于单一操作模式模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到最新推理大语言模型发展的启发，探讨如何增强语音大语言模型的性能。

Method: 将插槽填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，通过构建推理数据集并对模型进行有监督微调来实现。

Result: 引入推理步骤的实验表明，性能有所提升，但主要针对数学、逻辑和编码领域的文本推理大语言模型作为基础模型可能不如其他选择，混合模型性能最佳。

Conclusion: 混合语音大语言模型在保持直接和推理操作模式方面表现优于仅使用单一操作模式的模型。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 探讨在个性化大型语言模型（Persona-LLMs）中，注释者的人物角色如何影响其对仇恨言论的敏感性，尤其是涉及共享或不同身份之间的偏见

Method: 使用谷歌的Gemini和OpenAI的GPT-4.1-mini模型以及两种人物提示方法（浅层人物提示和基于检索增强生成的深层上下文化人物发展的方法）

Result: 分析了使用内群体和外群体注释者角色对模型检测性能和不同社会群体之间公平性的影响，展示了将社会人口属性纳入语言模型的能力与限制

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了宝贵的见解，强调了个性化方法在减少偏见方面的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

*Prakrithi Shivaprakash,Lekhansh Shukla,Animesh Mukherjee,Prabhat Chand,Pratima Murthy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 我们开发的LOGICAL系统通过微调的GLiNER模型高效地去除了临床记录中的个人可识别信息，表现显著优于现有方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去除临床记录中的个人可识别信息对于研究和人工智能的发展至关重要，尤其是在资源有限的环境中，传统的高计算成本的模型和API服务存在隐私风险。

Method: 本研究开发了LOGICAL系统，该系统基于经过微调的GLiNER模型，能够有效地从临床记录中去除个人可识别信息（PII）。

Result: 经过评估，LOGICAL系统在去除PII方面表现出色，总体微平均F1分数为0.980，显著优于对比方案。同时，它能够在标准笔记本上高效运行，且95%的文档完全被清洗干净。

Conclusion: 微调的GLiNER模型提供了一种准确、高效、安全的解决方案，适合在资源有限的环境中使用。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探讨手势在轮流交谈中的互补性，更好地理解人类交流中的多模态线索。

Method: 采用Mixture-of-Experts框架，结合文本、音频和手势信息进行多模态轮流交替预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，语义化手势的引入在轮流交替预测中优于基线模型，证明其在多模态交互中的辅助作用。

Conclusion: 研究表明，融入语义手势能够显著提升轮流交替预测的准确度，强调了手势在多模态交流中的重要性。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新基准，旨在评估多说话者对话理解的能力，特别关注说话者归属的问题，揭示了当前模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估当前模型在多发言者、多轮会话中的表现，特别是针对说话者归属推理的能力。

Method: 通过构建M3-SLU基准，结合四个开放语料库，设计了说话者归属问答和发言匹配两个任务，并提供基线结果。

Result: 基于基线测试结果，尽管模型能够捕捉到发言内容，但在识别说话者方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，揭示了当前模型在说话者归属理解方面的不足，并为进一步研究提供了挑战性标准。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型（LLM）在数学推理方面的表现，解决目前数据集低质量和信息丰富度不足的问题。

Method: AgenticMath pipeline

Result: 在只使用30-60K的数学样本数据集上微调3B-8B参数的LLM，相较于使用400K或2.3M样本的基线模型，效果具有竞争力或更优。

Conclusion: 高质量的目标数据生成比大规模低质量数据更有效地提升LLM的数学推理能力。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

TL;DR: LoongRL是一个数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain增强长上下文推理，显著提高多跳问答的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对长上下文推理的挑战，现有的强化学习方法尚未深入探索，因此需要一种新的方法来提升长上下文的推理能力。

Method: 通过KeyChain将短多跳问答转化为长上下文任务，重点在于增强模型的推理链追踪和信息检索能力。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为LoongRL的增强长上下文推理的强化学习方法。该方法通过KeyChain，将短期多跳问答任务转化为高难度的长上下文任务。模型需要一步一步追踪正确的链，识别真实问题，并检索相关事实进行推理。LoongRL在Qwen2.5模型上显著提升了长上下文多跳问答的准确性，并在长上下文检索方面表现出色，且保留了短上下文推理能力。

Conclusion: LoongRL证明了通过特殊的数据驱动策略，可以在长上下文推理中取得显著进展，并与更大型模型相媲美。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 针对现有MoE模型在灵活性和适应性上的局限性，提出了一种新的模型-系统协同设计方法。

Method: 通过离线重构引擎将单一的专家模型细分为多个细粒度的"子专家"，并利用在线调度引擎实现服务质量感知的调度。

Result: 在对三个不同MoE模型的评估中，MoE-Prism提供了超过4倍的稳定操作点，使得AI服务在严格延迟预算下的吞吐量提高了最多19.9%，或在资源有限情况下延迟降低了最多10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism显著提高了混合专家模型的灵活性和效率，使其能够更好地适应不同的服务水平目标，解决了资源过度配置的问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于手语数据集上缺乏广泛可获得的手语注释，并且不同数据集之间的注释差异显著，存在改进手语翻译系统的需求。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督，而无需任何手动注释，且在原始文本数据上学习。

Result: 在涵盖德语和美国语手语的数据集上进行评估，结果表明该方法比其他不依赖注释的方法表现更出色。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著优于其他不依赖注释的方法，为缺乏注释的手语翻译数据集设定了新的最先进技术，缩小了不依赖注释的系统与依赖注释的系统之间的差距。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Motivation: 解决传统SLT方法在多语言和跨语言泛化方面的局限性，并克服数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用多语言的语言无关多模态嵌入进行手语翻译监督，并通过耦合增强方法结合多语言翻译和视频扰动来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 本研究针对传统手语翻译(SLT)训练中存在的语言局限性和跨语言泛化问题，提出了一种新的方法。该方法利用了多语言的语言无关的多模态嵌入，以支持SLT，实现直接的多语言翻译。为了应对数据稀缺问题，研究者提出了一种耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强和视频级扰动，从而提升模型的鲁棒性。实验结果表明，相较于仅使用文本句子嵌入监督的方法，该方法在BLEURT评分上获得了一致的提升，尤其是在低资源环境中效果更显著。

Conclusion: 语言无关的嵌入监督与耦合增强的方法为传统手语翻译训练提供了一种可扩展和语义稳健的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了DFKI-MLT在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中的提交，提出了一种新的端到端架构，学习时空特征表示以提高翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在改善手语翻译过程，特别是克服标准方法在时序特征利用上的不足。

Method: 使用了一种集成时空特征表示和翻译的单一模型的端到端架构。

Result: 开发集上最佳系统表现为$5	ext{±}1$ BLEU分数，但测试集仅为$0.11	ext{±}0.06$ BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 虽然开发集上的最佳系统达到了$5	ext{±}1$ BLEU分数，但测试集的表现显著下降。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

*Yuan Gao,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0 提供了一个新基准，用于测量模型对自然学习者错误的选择性容忍，并验证了其在评估语言习得模式中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在弥合以性能为导向的基准与认知启发模型评估之间的差距。

Method: 该研究通过构建 BLiSS 1.0 基准，使用超过 280 万个自然学习者句子，提供 136,867 个控制三元组来测试选择性容忍的能力。

Result: 通过对不同模型的实验表明，选择性容忍是一种与标准语法能力不同的能力，且性能在训练范式上表现出明显的聚类。

Conclusion: BLiSS 1.0 是一个强有力的工具，可以测量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得的系统模式之间的对齐程度。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MINED基准，专注于评估大型多模态模型对时间敏感知识的理解能力，并通过多项任务分析其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估大型多模态模型对时间敏感知识的理解能力，因此需要一个新的评估框架。

Method: 在Wikipedia基础上，由两名专业注释员构建MINED基准，包含2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖六种知识类型，评估六个关键维度。

Result: 在对15个广泛使用的LMM进行评估时，Gemini-2.5-Pro模型表现最佳，而大多数开源模型对时间理解能力欠缺，尤其是在体育知识上表现最弱。

Conclusion: 大多数开源模型在处理时间敏感知识方面表现欠佳，建议通过知识编辑方法改善其更新能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于MBR解码在文本生成任务中表现优异，推测其在语音转文本任务中同样有效。

Method: 通过实验评估MBR解码与束搜索在ASR和ST任务中的表现，使用Whisper及其衍生模型。

Result: MBR解码在大多数实验设置下的准确性超越了束搜索。

Conclusion: MBR解码在离线自动语音识别（ASR）和语音翻译（ST）任务中展现出高准确性，是一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过对会员推断攻击和机器生成文本检测的研究，推动这两个独立研究领域之间的相互理解和知晓。

Method: 理论证明两项任务的最佳性能指标相同，并通过大规模实证实验验证了跨任务性能的强相关性。

Result: 实证实验结果显示，跨任务的性能之间有很强的排名相关性，特别是Binoculars在两项任务中均表现出色，证明了方法的可转移性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在会员推断攻击和机器生成文本检测之间需要更大的跨任务意识和合作，MINT评估工具为这两项任务的公平评估提供了支持。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在BabyLM预训练中序列长度的影响，发现最优长度与任务和架构相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在BabyLM预训练中序列长度的影响，以及在训练Baby LMs时应该使用的最佳序列长度。

Method: 使用100M字的训练数据，在固定计算预算下比较125M参数的Mamba和OPT模型。

Result: 较长序列通常表现较好，但对于语法泛化任务，较短序列已足够，而较长上下文则对形态类比推理任务更有利。

Conclusion: 在BabyLM的预训练中，最优序列长度依赖于具体任务和模型架构。

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lookahead是一个新提出的路由框架，通过预测模型输出的潜在表示，优化多模型系统的查询路由，显著提升获取性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前路由方法缺乏对输出信息和上下文的深入利用，限制了对复杂查询的处理能力，需改进以实现更好的路由决策。

Method: 提出了一种基于潜在输出预测的路由方法，通过因果和掩蔽语言模型实现。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的路由框架Lookahead，通过预测潜在输出的表示来优化多模型系统中的查询路由，提高了多样化语言模型的效率。该框架救助了仅依赖输入查询进行路由的传统方法的不足，包括对复杂查询的深层语义理解能力的缺失。实验证明，Lookahead在多个基准测试中相较于现有路由方法表现更优。

Conclusion: Lookahead框架通过更精准的模型选择方法，提高了多模型系统的查询处理效率，表现优于传统路由方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

Result: 该论文提出了一种统一的评估分类法，旨在解决不同语音模型及其任务的评估不一致性问题。分类法定义了三个正交维度：要测量的评估方面、模型所需的能力，以及执行任务所需的协议要求。通过对现有评估和基准的分类，该研究为模型选择合适的评估方法提供了框架，同时揭示了当前评估覆盖的系统性空白，指明了未来基准设计的优先事项。

Conclusion: 该研究为语音处理模型的评估提供了概念基础和实际指导，有助于更有效地选择和扩展评估方法。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在多语言基础模型的微调中，灾难性遗忘现象影响未见语言的表现。我们通过系统研究发现，模型与数据规模的相对关系是遗忘的主要决定因素，并且模型的指令跟随能力对保留多语言知识至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言模型微调中灾难性遗忘的产生条件，解决文献中关于何时遗忘的问题。

Method: 我们进行了控制实验，考察不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法对灾难性遗忘的影响。

Result: 发现相对的模型和数据规模是遗忘的主要决定因素，且参数效率微调并未表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: 跨语言对齐可以减轻遗忘，同时促进对未见目标语言的积极转移。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其与社会规范的一致性成为关键问题，而在波斯文化背景下针对社会偏见的资源仍然明显不足。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，利用250个不同群体的问卷，开发出一个包含16个文化类别的综合性基准数据集。

Result: 对几种开源大语言模型、一个闭源模型和波斯特定微调模型进行了基准测试，结果发现这些模型在波斯文化中存在明显的社会偏见，并且往往重复人类的偏见模式。

Conclusion: 本文介绍的PBBQ数据集为评估波斯大语言模型的社会偏见提供了一种基础，并指出当前模型在波斯文化中表现出了显著的社会偏见。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

TL;DR: 随着社交媒体的增长，风格化字体在用户间流行，但其对NLP模型造成隐患，本文提出SAD攻击方法，并验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体的发展导致用户使用风格化字体和类似字体的表情符号表达个性，这类文本视觉上吸引但对NLP模型造成隐患。

Method: 设计两种攻击强度的SAD，分别为轻量型和强型，通过对传统模型、大型语言模型及商业服务进行实验证明其效果。

Result: 提出了一种称为Style Attack Disguise (SAD)的基于风格的攻击方式，展现了其针对多种任务的强大攻击性能。

Conclusion: SAD在情感分类和机器翻译等任务上的测试结果显示其具有很强的攻击性能，对多模态任务也构成潜在威胁。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在代码补全中，如何有效整合外部上下文以提高生成质量，同时减少推理延迟是关键问题。

Method: 通过使用小型项目模块，将代码压缩为语义丰富的表示，并仅用少量单向向量来表示其上下文。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用压缩上下文的LLM可以在行完成任务中实现20-38%的Time-to-First-Token减少，相比于完整的RAG管道，延迟几乎无增。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架有效压缩上下文，在保证生成质量的同时，显著降低交互环境中代码补全的延迟。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Conclusion: 通过优化提示设计和情感分组，可以有效提升情感识别模型的性能，进而改善情感分析、人机交互以及用户行为理解。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

Conclusion: DiffAdapt为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径，证明了在不同难度问题上的适应性。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Result: 本研究提出了CoSense-LLM，这是一个以边缘为先的框架，将连续的多模态传感器流（如Wi-Fi CSI、IMU、音频、RFID以及轻量级视觉）转换为紧凑、可验证的语义标记，并在明确的延迟、能耗、带宽和隐私约束下与大型语言模型协同工作。CoSense-LLM包括四个部分：
(i) SenseFusion，一个轻量级编码器，将传感器嵌入与语言对齐，并将其压缩为简短的离散代码序列；
(ii) Edge-RAG，一个本地混合检索层，将生成内容与特定地点的策略和记笔记相结合；
(iii) PromptRouter，一个关注成本和不确定性的策略，选择仅边缘生成、边缘加检索或压缩云提升；
(iv) Secure Execution，一个可审计的修订路径，实施数据最小化，因此原始波形永远不会离开设备。该系统利用现代服务优化（包括分页或流式KV缓存、FlashAttention风格的内核、投机解码和量化LoRA适配器）以及在非独立同分布漂移下的设备个性化和联邦更新。在家庭、办公室和诊所的部署中，CoSense-LLM提供了基于事实的解释，同时满足严格的服务级别目标：其在边缘主导路径上维持每次决策的端到端延迟小于1秒（第95百分位数），通过优先本地检索的响应减少了跨层令牌和带宽成本，并通过仅传输离散代码和修订的元数据来保护隐私。消融试验表明，Edge-RAG改善了事实一致性，减少了矛盾，经过校准的不确定性使选择性回避和控制升级成为可能，KV加解码加速器降低了每次决策的能耗。结果支持一种边缘优先设计，将语义、隐私和可预测延迟作为大型模型部署中平等的目标，以应对干扰频繁的环境。

Conclusion: CoSense-LLM展示了在干扰频繁环境中实现语义、隐私和可预测延迟的边缘优先设计的有效性。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨 LLMs 能否像人类一样评估信息来源的动机，以提高在真实世界中的有效性。

Method: 通过控制实验和实际在线广告评估 LLMs 在处理带有动机色彩的信息时的表现。

Result: LLMs 能够在受控环境中有效地识别和折扣来自偏见来源的信息，但在复杂的在线广告环境中表现欠佳，需通过干预提高其敏感性。

Conclusion: LLMs 在处理动机驱动的信息时具备一定能力，但在新颖的现实世界情境中，需增强模型以实现更好的泛化。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

Motivation: 探究提示与内部表征质量之间的关系，从而理解预训练嵌入如何支持上下文任务解决。

Method: 进行了一系列关于提示嵌入的探测实验，分析零-shot 分类的各类提示模板组合。

Result: 提示确实影响表征的质量，但这些变化未必与提示的相关性一致，显示出可能存在意外行为的因素。

Conclusion: 提示的相关性与表征质量之间的关系并不一致，反驳了相关提示一定能提高表征质量的假设。

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律信息的可及性对普通人而言是一项持续的挑战，尤其是在理解和应用复杂的制度文本时。虽然欧盟提供了法律、议会回应和监管文件的开放获取，但这些资源对普通人来说可能很难探索。

Method: 构建EUDial数据集，该数据集基于204篇博客生成880个对话轮次，并提出了LexGuide框架，结合检索增强生成与层次主题组织，以结构化对话进程。

Result: EUDial和LexGuide被确立为促进积极法律对话系统的实用资源，展示了结构化导航在填补法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的空白的有效性。

Conclusion: 整体上，通过主动、结构化的导航方式，提高了普通人对法律信息的理解，从而成功建立了EUDial和LexGuide作为有效的法律对话系统资源。

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

TL;DR: SmartSwitch推理框架旨在提高大型语言模型的推理深度，解决欠思考问题，已在多个基准测试中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维（LongCoT）能力是大型语言模型在复杂推理任务中取得突破的关键，但模型的“欠思考”问题限制了其性能和效率。

Method: 通过感知模块监控推理过程，检测欠思考并使用干预模块插入深度提示，从而引导模型深入探索被忽视的思路。

Result: 提出了SmartSwitch推理框架，该框架能有效提升模型的深度推理能力。

Conclusion: 经过广泛实验验证，SmartSwitch显著提升了不同规模大型语言模型在数学推理基准测试中的性能。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大语言模型推理速度，并且解决传统知识蒸馏方法与规范解码目标的不一致性。

Method: 通过参考模型识别并过滤难以匹配的令牌，从而优化知识蒸馏过程。

Result: 提出AdaSPEC方法，该方法通过选择性过滤令牌，增强初步模型与目标模型的一致性，提高令牌接受率。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC在多个任务中均表现出色，相较于DistillSpec方法，令牌接受率提高了最多15%。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 研究模型合并作为代码混合自然语言处理的实用替代方案，以更有效地利用未标记数据。

Method: 从多语言基础模型开始，进行代码混合文本的继续预训练，合并检查点与基础模型，最后在下游任务数据上进行微调。

Result: 合并模型在多个指标上均优于全微调和继续预训练到微调的策略，尤其在低资源语言对的迁移学习任务中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 我们总结出应对不同数据条件的适应策略，并讨论了该方法在更广泛任务和更大模型中的局限性和扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

Motivation: 有效利用大型语言模型在调用工具时面临的上下文窗口限制问题，以提高工具检索的效率与准确性。

Result: 提出ToolDreamer框架，通过生成假想工具描述来改善工具检索的效果，并提高稀疏和密集检索器的性能。

Conclusion: ToolDreamer框架能够提升检索器的性能，减轻LLM的推理负担，使其更有效地处理大量工具。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

Motivation: 传统的翻译驱动提示策略存在以英语为中心的问题，忽视了文化维度，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的提示空间优化框架，系统性地转化翻译后的提示以提高自然度、文化适应性和难度增强。

Result: 在使用现成的多语言大语言模型的情况下，对12种语言的提示进行优化，在相同数据条件下，相比于仅翻译的基线，准确率提高了4.7%、Flores XCometXL提高了2.4%，在mArenaHard上的偏好胜率提高了35.3%。

Conclusion: 提示空间优化被确立为构建更加稳健、文化扎根且全球化能力更强的多语言大语言模型的有效范式。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Result: 在AIME24基准测试中，Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型的pass@1分数较原始GRPO基线提高了44.3%。

Conclusion: Scaf-GRPO能够有效提高大语言模型的推理能力，帮助模型解决以前无法处理的复杂问题，推动自主推理的前沿发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

Motivation: 旨在深入理解大型语言模型的记忆化风险，并提出应对措施，以提升模型的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 使用开放源代码的LLM进行训练，包括标准模型和扰动模型，并对不同文本插入策略进行实验，分析记忆化现象。

Result: 本研究介绍了Hubble，一个开放源代码的大型语言模型（LLMs）套件，旨在科学研究LLM记忆化现象。Hubble模型包括标准模型和扰动模型：标准模型是在大量英文语料库上预训练的，而扰动模型则在相同方式下训练，但控制插入文本（例如书籍片段、传记和测试集）以模拟关键记忆风险。我们的核心发布包括8个模型——1B或8B参数的标准模型和扰动模型，分别在100B或500B令牌上进行预训练，确认了记忆风险是由敏感数据的频率相对于训练语料库的大小决定的（例如，一个密码在较小语料库中出现一次比在较大语料库中更容易被记住）。我们的发布还包括6个在不同预训练阶段插入文本的扰动模型，显示没有持续暴露的敏感数据可以被遗忘。这些发现建议了两种应对记忆风险的最佳实践：通过增加训练语料库的大小来稀释敏感数据，并将敏感数据的出现顺序安排得更早在训练中。除了这些一般性经验发现，Hubble还使广泛的记忆研究成为可能；例如，分析传记揭示了不同类型私人信息被记忆的难易程度。我们还证明Hubble中的随机插入使其成为会员推断和机器遗忘的理想测试平台，并邀请社区进一步探索、基准测试和在我们的工作基础上构建。

Conclusion: Hubble模型的研究显示，通过增加训练数据和调整数据插入顺序，可以有效降低LLM的记忆化风险，提供了实用的最佳实践，同时期待更多研究和应用。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Conclusion: 局部指导显著提高了多智能体路径规划的解决方案质量，且未超出适度的时间预算。

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of
real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers
additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global
scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire
workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby
improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an
alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent.
While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may
appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying
informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve
solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to
LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes
a new performance frontier for MAPF.

sustainability, and policy planning. Effective air quality management requires
predictive tools that can integrate diverse datasets and communicate complex
spatial and temporal pollution patterns. There is a gap in interactive tools
with seamless integration of forecasting and visualization of spatial
distributions of air pollutant concentrations. We present CityAQVis, an
interactive machine learning ML sandbox tool designed to predict and visualize
pollutant concentrations at the ground level using multi-source data, which
includes satellite observations, meteorological parameters, population density,
elevation, and nighttime lights. While traditional air quality visualization
tools often lack forecasting capabilities, CityAQVis enables users to build and
compare predictive models, visualizing the model outputs and offering insights
into pollution dynamics at the ground level. The pilot implementation of the
tool is tested through case studies predicting nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
concentrations in metropolitan regions, highlighting its adaptability to
various pollutants. Through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), the
user can perform comparative visualizations of the spatial distribution of
surface-level pollutant concentration in two different urban scenarios. Our
results highlight the potential of ML-driven visual analytics to improve
situational awareness and support data-driven decision-making in air quality
management.

TL;DR: FIRETWIN is a Digital Twin that integrates ecological data for improved wildfire management, featuring real-time 3D visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance decision-making with integrated digital representations and historical data.

Method: Introducing a cyber-physical Digital Twin (DT) for wildfire management.

Result: FIRETWIN provides a 3D virtual globe for real-time visualization and scenario analysis of wildfire behavior.

Conclusion: FIRETWIN revolutionizes wildfire management through advanced simulations and immersive visual environments.

Abstract: Current wildfire management systems lack integrated virtual environments that
combine historical data with immersive digital representations, hindering deep
analysis and effective decision making. This paper introduces FIRETWIN, a
cyber-physical Digital Twin (DT) designed to bridge complex ecological data and
operationally relevant, high-fidelity visualizations for actionable incident
response. FIRETWIN generates a dynamic 3D virtual globe that visualizes
evolving fire behavior in real time, driven by output from physics-based fire
models. The system supports multimodal perspectives, including satellite and
drone viewpoints comparable to NOAA GOES-18 imagery - enabling comprehensive
scenario analysis. Users interact with the environment to assess current fire
conditions, anticipate progression, and evaluate available resources.
Leveraging Google Maps, Unreal Engine, and pre-generated outputs from the CAWFE
coupled weather-wildland fire model, we reconstruct the spread of the 2014 King
Fire in California Eldorado National Forest. Procedural forest generation and
particle-level fire control enable a level of realism and interactivity not
possible in field training.

Motivation: 为了了解人们如何与大语言模型（LLMs）互动以解决健康问题，并改善信息获取的方式。

Method: 混合方法研究

Result: 参与者评价Wayfinding AI比基线AI更有帮助、相关和针对个人关注进行定制，显示出主动寻求上下文的重要性。

Conclusion: 主动寻求上下文对对话动态有显著影响，建议在对话式AI设计中采用此模式以帮助用户更好地导航健康话题。

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线考试中AI辅助作弊的威胁，特别是大型语言模型（LLMs）如何影响考试安全性。

Method: 采用k均值聚类分析学生在考试中的可疑行为，包括选择文本、右键点击和失去注意力等行为。

Result: 通过聚类分析识别出表现出可疑行为的学生群体，并发现这些学生的考试成绩普遍较高。

Conclusion: 本研究的初步结果表明，可疑行为与考试成绩存在关联，为在线考试中AI辅助作弊的检测提供了重要见解。

Abstract: AI-assisted cheating has emerged as a significant threat in the context of
online exams. Advanced browser extensions now enable large language models
(LLMs) to answer questions presented in online exams within seconds, thereby
compromising the security of these assessments. In this study, the behaviors of
students (N = 52) on an online exam platform during a proctored, face-to-face
exam were analyzed using clustering methods, with the aim of identifying groups
of students exhibiting suspicious behavior potentially associated with
cheating. Additionally, students in different clusters were compared in terms
of their exam scores. Suspicious exam behaviors in this study were defined as
selecting text within the question area, right-clicking, and losing focus on
the exam page. The total frequency of these behaviors performed by each student
during the exam was extracted, and k-Means clustering was employed for the
analysis. The findings revealed that students were classified into six clusters
based on their suspicious behaviors. It was found that students in four of the
six clusters, representing approximately 33% of the total sample, exhibited
suspicious behaviors at varying levels. When the exam scores of these students
were compared, it was observed that those who engaged in suspicious behaviors
scored, on average, 30-40 points higher than those who did not. Although
further research is necessary to validate these findings, this preliminary
study provides significant insights into the detection of AI-assisted cheating
in online exams using behavior analytics.

Method: 通过借鉴用户的个人记忆记录，生成句子建议，并考虑话题偏好和人际亲密度。

Result: 用户研究表明，SocializeChat在提升社交互动的有效性方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: SocializeChat可以增强AAC支持的社交互动的包容性和相关性。

Abstract: Elderly people with speech impairments often face challenges in engaging in
meaningful social communication, particularly when using Augmentative and
Alternative Communication (AAC) tools that primarily address basic needs.
Moreover, effective chats often rely on personal memories, which is hard to
extract and reuse. We introduce SocializeChat, an AAC tool that generates
sentence suggestions by drawing on users' personal memory records. By
incorporating topic preference and interpersonal closeness, the system reuses
past experience and tailors suggestions to different social contexts and
conversation partners. SocializeChat not only leverages past experiences to
support interaction, but also treats conversations as opportunities to create
new memories, fostering a dynamic cycle between memory and communication. A
user study shows its potential to enhance the inclusivity and relevance of
AAC-supported social interaction.

Motivation: 考虑到AI生成图像在社交媒体上的普遍性，研究用户如何看待这些图像的透明性和真实性具有重要意义。

Method: 通过一项包含105名参与者的被试内实验研究，调查标签详细程度和内容风险对用户参与度及感知的影响。

Result: 提高标签的详细程度增强了用户对标签透明度的感知，但内容的风险程度则显著影响了用户的参与度和信任感。

Conclusion: 社交媒体平台可以采用详细标签以提高透明度，而不影响用户参与度，提供了AI生成内容有效标签策略的见解。

Abstract: AI-generated images are increasingly prevalent on social media, raising
concerns about trust and authenticity. This study investigates how different
levels of label detail (basic, moderate, maximum) and content stakes (high vs.
low) influence user engagement with and perceptions of AI-generated images
through a within-subjects experimental study with 105 participants. Our
findings reveal that increasing label detail enhances user perceptions of label
transparency but does not affect user engagement. However, content stakes
significantly impact user engagement and perceptions, with users demonstrating
higher engagement and trust in low-stakes images. These results suggest that
social media platforms can adopt detailed labels to improve transparency
without compromising user engagement, offering insights for effective labeling
strategies for AI-generated content.

and deployed on the Meta Quest 3 platform, CLiVR enables trainees to engage in
natural dialogue with virtual patients. Each simulation is dynamically
generated from a syndrome-symptom database and enhanced with sentiment analysis
to provide feedback on communication tone. Through an expert user study
involving medical school faculty (n=13), we assessed usability, realism, and
perceived educational impact. Results demonstrated strong user acceptance, high
confidence in educational potential, and valuable feedback for improvement.
CLiVR offers a scalable, immersive supplement to SP-based training.

Result: 本文研究了用户面向的人工智能（AI）产品中的"过顶"包容性偏见，这些偏见表现在排斥具备某些问题解决方法的用户。通过与三个AI产品团队的实地研究，作者识别出了六种独特的AI包容性漏洞，这些漏洞发生了83次，并提出了在47个实例中进行修复的建议。此外，研究还开发出一种新型的GenderMag-for-AI设计方法，能有效检测特定类型的AI包容性漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，用户面向AI产品中的包容性漏洞是普遍存在的，通过适当的设计方法可以有效识别和解决这些问题。

Abstract: While much research has shown the presence of AI's "under-the-hood" biases
(e.g., algorithmic, training data, etc.), what about "over-the-hood"
inclusivity biases: barriers in user-facing AI products that disproportionately
exclude users with certain problem-solving approaches? Recent research has
begun to report the existence of such biases -- but what do they look like, how
prevalent are they, and how can developers find and fix them? To find out, we
conducted a field study with 3 AI product teams, to investigate what kinds of
AI inclusivity bugs exist uniquely in user-facing AI products, and whether/how
AI product teams might harness an existing (non-AI-oriented) inclusive design
method to find and fix them. The teams' work resulted in identifying 6 types of
AI inclusivity bugs arising 83 times, fixes covering 47 of these bug instances,
and a new variation of the GenderMag inclusive design method, GenderMag-for-AI,
that is especially effective at detecting certain kinds of AI inclusivity bugs.

Method: 研究团队通过反馈工作流进行实验，收集艺术表演数据，并创建沉浸式的实时互动艺术体验，从而分析人类与AI之间的互动与反应。

Result: 通过反馈工作流捕捉现场表演数据，处理数字转化，创造实时互动艺术体验，揭示艺术家与观众的体验，展示音乐家如何在算法建议中选择性地保持或放弃个人创意。

Conclusion: 为实现去殖民化的潜力，需要重新设计文化生存工具或系统，使技术不仅是反馈环境，而是去殖民实践的场所，挑战数字生态中的算法主导。

Abstract: As emergent artificial intelligence technologies increasingly assert roles as
assistants within intangible cultural heritage contexts, researchers and
artists observe existing questions on the theme of agency negotiation, cultural
resistance, and technical critique. This research interrogates power dynamics
in human-AI sovereignty and entanglement for nomadic improvisational Dutar
performance, a living cultural heritage through a long-necked lute from the
Central Asia region. To investigate tensions between human agency and
computational hegemony, the researcher and artists examined and iterated a
feedback workflow that captures live performance data, processes digital
transformations, and creates a real-time interactive art experience via
immersive environments. Empirical data from artists and audience reveal
modulations where musicians selectively embrace or reject algorithmic
suggestions to preserve creative identity. The author concludes that decolonial
potential requires redesigning tools or systems for cultural survivance, where
technology becomes not merely a feedback environment but a site for decolonial
praxis, challenging computational hegemony in digital ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的多样性增加，用户需要高效地比较和整合不同模型的输出，以获得更高质量和更全面的响应。

Method: 介绍LLMartini系统，通过无缝比较、选择和直观的跨模型组合工具来优化多个大型语言模型（LLMs）的输出整合过程。

Result: 用户研究结果表明，LLMartini在任务完成时间、认知负荷和用户满意度等指标上显著优于传统的手动方法。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了以人为本的设计对提升多LLM交互效率和创造力的重要性，并为利用不同语言模型的互补优势提供了实际建议。

Abstract: The growing diversity of large language models (LLMs) means users often need
to compare and combine outputs from different models to obtain higher-quality
or more comprehensive responses. However, switching between separate interfaces
and manually integrating outputs is inherently inefficient, leading to a high
cognitive burden and fragmented workflows. To address this, we present
LLMartini, a novel interactive system that supports seamless comparison,
selection, and intuitive cross-model composition tools. The system decomposes
responses into semantically aligned segments based on task-specific criteria,
automatically merges consensus content, and highlights model differences
through color coding while preserving unique contributions. In a user study
(N=18), LLMartini significantly outperformed conventional manual methods across
all measured metrics, including task completion time, cognitive load, and user
satisfaction. Our work highlights the importance of human-centered design in
enhancing the efficiency and creativity of multi-LLM interactions and offers
practical implications for leveraging the complementary strengths of various
language models.

Method: 引入上下文感知的半监督框架，结合元学习，从有限示例生成专家嵌入，使用伪标签进行训练并实现在线适应。

Result: 该论文解决了限制学习推迟（L2D）系统实际部署的人群数据稀缺性问题。我们引入了一种上下文感知的半监督框架，利用元学习从少量示例生成专家特定的嵌入。实验结果表明，该机制的双重用途：既可以为训练生成大量伪标签，又可在测试时实现对新专家的即时适应。我们的实验结果显示，采用这些合成标签训练的模型快速接近专家级性能，从而验证了我们方法的数据效率。通过解决关键的训练瓶颈，本研究使得自适应L2D系统在实际应用中更加可行和可扩展，为人类与人工智能的协作铺平了道路。为了促进可重复性，并解决主文中未涵盖的实现细节，我们提供了源代码和训练配置。

Conclusion: 我们的框架有效解决了数据稀缺问题，使学习推迟系统的适应性更强，推动了人类与AI的合作。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate
reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制无人飞行器（UAV）的任务在认知上要求高，事故的发生往往与不足的情境意识、缺乏训练和不佳的用户体验有关。

Method: 开发了一款虚拟现实申请，参与者在四种不同的摄像机视角下控制实际的无人机，同时收集了飞行数据和主观体验评估。

Result: 通过增强的直观和沉浸式视觉反馈，尤其是数字双胞胎技术，提高了飞行员的意识和整体体验质量。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，第一人称视角虽然增加了心理需求和轨迹偏差，但控制输入更流畅，第三人称视角则更受欢迎，用户反应呈极化趋势。

Abstract: Controlling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is a cognitively demanding task,
with accidents often arising from insufficient situational awareness,
inadequate training, and poor user experiences. Providing more intuitive and
immersive visual feedback, particularly through Digital Twin technologies,
offers new opportunities to enhance pilot awareness and overall experience
quality. In this study, we investigate how different virtual points of view
(POVs) influence user experience and performance during UAV piloting in Virtual
Reality (VR), utilizing a digital twin that faithfully replicates the
real-world flight environment. We developed a VR application that enables
participants to control a physical DJI Mini 4 Pro drone while immersed in a
digital twin with four distinct camera perspectives: Baseline View (static
external), First-Person View, Chase View, and Third-Person View. Nineteen
participants completed a series of ring-based obstacle courses from each
perspective. In addition to objective flight data, we collected standardized
subjective assessments of user experience, presence, workload, cybersickness,
and situational awareness. Quantitative analyses revealed that the First-Person
View was associated with significantly higher mental demand and effort, greater
trajectory deviation, but smoother control inputs compared to the Third-Person
and Chase perspectives. Complementing these findings, preference data indicated
that the Third-Person View was most consistently favored, whereas the
First-Person View elicited polarized reactions.

Abstract: Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on student learning, with
extensive research examining how best to implement it in educational settings.
Increasingly, feedback is being generated by artificial intelligence (AI),
offering scalable and adaptive responses. Two widely studied approaches are
directive feedback, which gives explicit explanations and reduces cognitive
load to speed up learning, and metacognitive feedback which prompts learners to
reflect, track their progress, and develop self-regulated learning (SRL)
skills. While both approaches have clear theoretical advantages, their
comparative effects on engagement, confidence, and quality of work remain
underexplored. This study presents a semester-long randomised controlled trial
with 329 students in an introductory design and programming course using an
adaptive educational platform. Participants were assigned to receive directive,
metacognitive, or hybrid AI-generated feedback that blended elements of both
directive and metacognitive feedback. Results showed that revision behaviour
differed across feedback conditions, with Hybrid prompting the most revisions
compared to Directive and Metacognitive. Confidence ratings were uniformly
high, and resource quality outcomes were comparable across conditions. These
findings highlight the promise of AI in delivering feedback that balances
clarity with reflection. Hybrid approaches, in particular, show potential to
combine actionable guidance for immediate improvement with opportunities for
self-reflection and metacognitive growth.

Conclusion: 验证的作用及其不完善性对大型语言模型的性能提升至关重要，通过运输问题框架，可以更好地理解这些因素之间的动态关系。

Abstract: While test-time scaling with verification has shown promise in improving the
performance of large language models (LLMs), the role of the verifier and its
imperfections remain underexplored. The effect of verification manifests
through interactions of three quantities: (i) the generator's coverage, (ii)
the verifier's region of convergence (ROC), and (iii) the sampling algorithm's
sub-optimality. Though recent studies capture subsets of these factors, a
unified framework quantifying the geometry of their interplay is missing. We
frame verifiable test-time scaling as a transport problem. This characterizes
the interaction of coverage, ROC, and sub-optimality, and uncovers that the
sub-optimality--coverage curve exhibits three regimes. A transport regime --
where sub-optimality increases with coverage, a policy improvement regime --
where sub-optimality may decrease with coverage, depending on the verifier's
ROC, and a saturation regime -- where sub-optimality plateaus, unaffected by
coverage. We further propose and analyze two classes of sampling algorithms --
sequential and batched, and examine how their computational complexities shape
these trade-offs. Empirical results with Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models
corroborate our theoretical findings.

diag- nosis, but most approaches rely on static, fully observed datasets and
fail to reflect the sequential, resource-aware reasoning clinicians use in
practice. Diagnosis remains complex and error prone, especially in
high-pressure or resource-limited settings, underscoring the need for
frameworks that help clinicians make timely and cost-effective decisions. We
propose ACTMED (Adaptive Clinical Test selection via Model-based Experimental
Design), a diagnostic framework that integrates Bayesian Experimental Design
(BED) with large language models (LLMs) to better emulate real-world diagnostic
reasoning. At each step, ACTMED selects the test expected to yield the greatest
reduction in diagnostic uncertainty for a given patient. LLMs act as flexible
simulators, generating plausible patient state distributions and supporting
belief updates without requiring structured, task-specific training data.
Clinicians can remain in the loop; reviewing test suggestions, interpreting
intermediate outputs, and applying clinical judgment throughout. We evaluate
ACTMED on real-world datasets and show it can optimize test selection to
improve diagnostic accuracy, interpretability, and resource use. This
represents a step to- ward transparent, adaptive, and clinician-aligned
diagnostic systems that generalize across settings with reduced reliance on
domain-specific data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有多模态大型语言模型在音乐理解中的基本能力与缺陷

Method: 引入MUSE基准

Result: 通过对四个最先进模型的评估，发现其能力存在较大差异且与人类专家水平存在明显差距，部分模型表现接近随机水平

Conclusion: 该研究为评估音乐表示的稳定性及促进更强大的AI系统的发展提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in
audio understanding, but current evaluations may obscure fundamental weaknesses
in relational reasoning. We introduce the Music Understanding and Structural
Evaluation (MUSE) Benchmark, an open-source resource with 10 tasks designed to
probe fundamental music perception skills. We evaluate four SOTA models (Gemini
Pro and Flash, Qwen2.5-Omni, and Audio-Flamingo 3) against a large human
baseline (N=200). Our results reveal a wide variance in SOTA capabilities and a
persistent gap with human experts. While Gemini Pro succeeds on basic
perception, Qwen and Audio Flamingo 3 perform at or near chance, exposing
severe perceptual deficits. Furthermore, we find Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting provides inconsistent, often detrimental results. Our work provides a
critical tool for evaluating invariant musical representations and driving
development of more robust AI systems.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗领域的快速扩展，评估这些系统对于按照CONSORT标准进行临床试验报告的能力变得尤为重要。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证的数据，系统比较了两个具有代表性的语言模型在三种提示条件下的表现。

Result: 在不同提示类型下，模型在处理 CONSORT 项目时展现出明显的差异，包括推理风格的变化、明显的不确定性和不同的解释方式，这些都影响了响应模式。

Conclusion: 现有的大型语言模型在临床试验报告的合规性自动化方面存在局限性，理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗人工智能至关重要。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了减少推理过程中的计算负担，提出模式选择和早期退出两种方法，以更好地平衡推理效率与效果。

Method: 本文通过实证研究九个基线，分析了模式选择和早期退出在推理过程中的不同决策时机及其效果。

Result: 研究发现，依赖内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好，但稳定性仍然存在问题，而基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而常常失败。

Conclusion: 现有方法仅依赖模型提供的信息无法有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题，显示出该任务的持续挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT在法律领域的能力，尤其是其在处理复杂问题和理解法律原则上的局限性

Method: 通过实验对比ChatGPT和正则表达式(Regex)在法律领域的表现

Result: ChatGPT虽然具备必要的知识和技能，但在整合和推理过程中未能给出全面的结果，显示出其重大局限性

Conclusion: 真正的智能，特别是在法律领域，仍是人类的独特特征，AI在理解和推理上有其固有限制。

Abstract: This study examines the performance of ChatGPT with an experiment in the
legal domain. We compare the outcome with it a baseline using regular
expressions (Regex), rather than focusing solely on the assessment against
human performance. The study reveals that even if ChatGPT has access to the
necessary knowledge and competencies, it is unable to assemble them, reason
through, in a way that leads to an exhaustive result. This unveils a major
limitation of ChatGPT. Intelligence encompasses the ability to break down
complex issues and address them according to multiple required competencies,
providing a unified and comprehensive solution. In the legal domain, one of the
most crucial tasks is reading legal decisions and extracting key passages
condensed from principles of law (PoLs), which are then incorporated into
subsequent rulings by judges or defense documents by lawyers. In performing
this task, artificial intelligence lacks an all-encompassing understanding and
reasoning, which makes it inherently limited. Genuine intelligence, remains a
uniquely human trait, at least in this particular field.

Conclusion: 通过扩展DSA-framework，本文提出了一种新的论证解释方法，以处理不一致先例的推理问题。

Abstract: Precedential constraint is one foundation of case-based reasoning in AI and
Law. It generally assumes that the underlying set of precedents must be
consistent. To relax this assumption, a generalized notion of the reason model
has been introduced. While several argumentative explanation approaches exist
for reasoning with precedents based on the traditional consistent reason model,
there has been no corresponding argumentative explanation method developed for
this generalized reasoning framework accommodating inconsistent precedents. To
address this question, this paper examines an extension of the derivation state
argumentation framework (DSA-framework) to explain the reasoning according to
the generalized notion of the reason model.

Result: 本文提出了一种新的连续增强学习方法CKA-RL，旨在解决在不断变化的环境中学习的挑战。CKA-RL通过维持特定任务的知识向量池，动态利用历史知识来适应新任务，能够有效减少灾难性遗忘并优化知识的转移。该方法还包括一个自适应知识融合机制，以应对可扩展性挑战，降低内存需求，同时保持重要知识的保留。实验结果表明，CKA-RL在三个基准测试中优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明CKA-RL在处理连续任务时可以显著提高性能，尤其在减少灾难性遗忘和提升知识传递效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning enables agents to learn optimal behaviors through
interactions with environments. However, real-world environments are typically
non-stationary, requiring agents to continuously adapt to new tasks and
changing conditions. Although Continual Reinforcement Learning facilitates
learning across multiple tasks, existing methods often suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and inefficient knowledge utilization. To address these challenges,
we propose Continual Knowledge Adaptation for Reinforcement Learning (CKA-RL),
which enables the accumulation and effective utilization of historical
knowledge. Specifically, we introduce a Continual Knowledge Adaptation
strategy, which involves maintaining a task-specific knowledge vector pool and
dynamically using historical knowledge to adapt the agent to new tasks. This
process mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enables efficient knowledge
transfer across tasks by preserving and adapting critical model parameters.
Additionally, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Merging mechanism that combines
similar knowledge vectors to address scalability challenges, reducing memory
requirements while ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. Experiments
on three benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed CKA-RL outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving an improvement of 4.20% in overall
performance and 8.02% in forward transfer. The source code is available at

Method: 提出一种新方法DAIL（Distributional Aligned Learning），通过分布式策略和语义对齐来处理语言指令的歧义性。

Result: DAIL通过理论结果和广泛的实验验证，增强了任务的可区分性，能够解决指令的歧义问题，且在多项基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL有效提高了对自然语言指令的理解能力，解决了任务执行中的歧义问题，展示出相较于基线方法的优越性能。

Abstract: Comprehending natural language and following human instructions are critical
capabilities for intelligent agents. However, the flexibility of linguistic
instructions induces substantial ambiguity across language-conditioned tasks,
severely degrading algorithmic performance. To address these limitations, we
present a novel method named DAIL (Distributional Aligned Learning), featuring
two key components: distributional policy and semantic alignment. Specifically,
we provide theoretical results that the value distribution estimation mechanism
enhances task differentiability. Meanwhile, the semantic alignment module
captures the correspondence between trajectories and linguistic instructions.
Extensive experimental results on both structured and visual observation
benchmarks demonstrate that DAIL effectively resolves instruction ambiguities,
achieving superior performance to baseline methods. Our implementation is

Motivation: 基于现有城市感知系统在多样化场景下的有限泛化能力和决策过程中的可解释性不足，提出AgentSense以改进这一问题。

Method: AgentSense 利用经典规划器生成基线解决方案，并通过多智能体进化系统对其进行迭代细化，以适应城市动态条件及工人偏好。

Abstract: Web-based participatory urban sensing has emerged as a vital approach for
modern urban management by leveraging mobile individuals as distributed
sensors. However, existing urban sensing systems struggle with limited
generalization across diverse urban scenarios and poor interpretability in
decision-making. In this work, we introduce AgentSense, a hybrid, training-free
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) into participatory urban
sensing through a multi-agent evolution system. AgentSense initially employs
classical planner to generate baseline solutions and then iteratively refines
them to adapt sensing task assignments to dynamic urban conditions and
heterogeneous worker preferences, while producing natural language explanations
that enhance transparency and trust. Extensive experiments across two
large-scale mobility datasets and seven types of dynamic disturbances
demonstrate that AgentSense offers distinct advantages in adaptivity and
explainability over traditional methods. Furthermore, compared to single-agent
LLM baselines, our approach outperforms in both performance and robustness,
while delivering more reasonable and transparent explanations. These results
position AgentSense as a significant advancement towards deploying adaptive and
explainable urban sensing systems on the web.

Motivation: 旨在帮助吉他学生克服和弦音独奏的学习难度，促进即兴演奏能力的发展。

Method: 利用加权图模型，节点代表和弦琶音，边权重基于最优过渡音，找到最短路径以重构独奏线。

Result: 本文提出了一种基于图的引擎，用于为吉他学生计算和弦音独奏建议。和弦音独奏是即兴演奏中的一个基本实践，演奏者仅使用当前和弦中包含的音符。该实践是所有高级爵士吉他理论的基础，但学习和练习起来十分困难。文中首先讨论了生成和弦音琶音的方法。接着，我们构建了一个加权图，每个节点代表和弦进行中的和弦音琶音。随后，我们根据最佳过渡音计算每个连续和弦节点之间的边权重。然后，我们在此图中找到最短路径并重构和弦音独奏线。最后，我们讨论了一个用户友好的系统以处理吉他学生的输入和输出，以帮助他们练习和弦音独奏。

Conclusion: 本研究为吉他学生提供了一种高效的和弦音独奏生成工具，促进了和弦即兴演奏的学习与实践。

Abstract: We present a graph-based engine for computing chord tone soloing suggestions
for guitar students. Chord tone soloing is a fundamental practice for
improvising over a chord progression, where the instrumentalist uses only the
notes contained in the current chord. This practice is a building block for all
advanced jazz guitar theory but is difficult to learn and practice. First, we
discuss methods for generating chord-tone arpeggios. Next, we construct a
weighted graph where each node represents a chord tone arpeggio for a chord in
the progression. Then, we calculate the edge weight between each consecutive
chord's nodes in terms of optimal transition tones. We then find the shortest
path through this graph and reconstruct a chord-tone soloing line. Finally, we
discuss a user-friendly system to handle input and output to this engine for
guitar students to practice chord tone soloing.

Abstract: The increasing number of spectators and players in e-sports, along with the
development of optimized communication solutions and cloud computing
technology, has motivated the constant growth of the online game industry. Even
though Artificial Intelligence-based solutions for e-sports analytics are
traditionally defined as extracting meaningful patterns from related data and
visualizing them to enhance decision-making, most of the effort in professional
winning prediction has been focused on the classification aspect from a batch
perspective, also leaving aside the visualization techniques. Consequently,
this work contributes to an explainable win prediction classification solution
in streaming in which input data is controlled over several sliding windows to
reflect relevant game changes. Experimental results attained an accuracy higher
than 90 %, surpassing the performance of competing solutions in the literature.
Ultimately, our system can be leveraged by ranking and recommender systems for
informed decision-making, thanks to the explainability module, which fosters
trust in the outcome predictions.

TL;DR: RLIE框架结合LLMs与概率建模，通过四个阶段学习加权规则，显示出直接应用规则的优越性，但LLMs的提示可能降低准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs与概率规则学习结合的机会，以克服传统方法中对预定义范畴空间的依赖，提升推理的可靠性。

Method: 通过四个阶段，RLIE框架生成并优化加权规则，采用逻辑回归学习概率权重，并对结果进行评估。

Result: 该研究提出了一种名为RLIE的统一框架，将大型语言模型（LLMs）与概率建模结合，旨在学习加权规则。这一框架分为四个阶段：规则生成、逻辑回归、迭代优化和评估。评估结果表明，直接应用学习到的加权规则可以获得更好的性能，而使用LLMs提示规则及其权重反而会降低准确性。这表明LLMs在语义生成和理解方面表现优异，但在精确的概率整合上则不够可靠。

Conclusion: RLIE框架清晰阐明了LLMs在诱导推理中的潜力与局限性，并便于与经典的概率规则组合方法结合，从而实现更可靠的神经符号推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can propose rules in natural language,
sidestepping the need for a predefined predicate space in traditional rule
learning. Yet many LLM-based approaches ignore interactions among rules, and
the opportunity to couple LLMs with probabilistic rule learning for robust
inference remains underexplored. We present RLIE, a unified framework that
integrates LLMs with probabilistic modeling to learn a set of weighted rules.
RLIE has four stages: (1) Rule generation, where an LLM proposes and filters
candidates; (2) Logistic regression, which learns probabilistic weights for
global selection and calibration; (3) Iterative refinement, which updates the
rule set using prediction errors; and (4) Evaluation, which compares the
weighted rule set as a direct classifier with methods that inject rules into an
LLM. We evaluate multiple inference strategies on real-world datasets. Applying
rules directly with their learned weights yields superior performance, whereas
prompting LLMs with the rules, weights, and logistic-model outputs surprisingly
degrades accuracy. This supports the view that LLMs excel at semantic
generation and interpretation but are less reliable for precise probabilistic
integration. RLIE clarifies the potential and limitations of LLMs for inductive
reasoning and couples them with classic probabilistic rule combination methods
to enable more reliable neuro-symbolic reasoning.

Result: 该研究提出了一种名为Memo的变换器架构，用于强化学习，旨在提高在需要记忆的长期任务中的性能。Memo通过在训练过程中将定期汇总的令牌与模型输入交错，来创建和检索记忆。这种方法在模拟环境中表现出色，优于简单的长上下文变换器基准，同时在计算和存储方面也更加高效。它还在推理时对更长的上下文有更好的泛化能力，并在流式设置中保持稳健。

Conclusion: Memo通过有效的记忆创建和检索机制，在多种任务中表现出比现有模型更优的性能。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的1D和2D优化未能考虑成本和延迟约束，导致推理缩放效率不高。

Method: 3D优化框架结合准确性、成本和延迟，进行联合校准和决策选择。

Result: 通过Monte Carlo模拟，评估4种优化方法在3D多目标优化问题上的表现，寻找最佳推理缩放参数k。

Conclusion: 该框架为在不同操作环境下进行部署感知的推理缩放提供了理论基础。

Abstract: AI inference scaling is often tuned through 1D heuristics (a fixed reasoning
passes) or 2D bivariate trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. compute), which fail
to consider cost and latency constraints. We introduce a 3D optimization
framework that jointly calibrates accuracy, cost, and latency within a unified
decision space, enabling constraints-aware inference scaling. Using Monte Carlo
simulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large
language models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Framing inference scaling in MOO
shapes a feasible space that 1D and 2D optimizations fail to capture, enabling
environmentadaptive selection of the inference scaling k. Results show that
knee-point optimization achieves the best balance, while accuracy-maximization
remains favorable when precision is prioritized. The framework establishes a
theoretical foundation for deployment-aware inference scaling across diverse
operational contexts.

Conclusion: 提出的基础模型在多任务学习下展示了良好的应用潜力，有助于临床神经影像学的实际应用。

Abstract: A reliable foundation model of functional neuroimages is critical to promote
clinical applications where the performance of current AI models is
significantly impeded by a limited sample size. To that end, tremendous efforts
have been made to pretraining large models on extensive unlabeled fMRI data
using scalable self-supervised learning. Since self-supervision is not
necessarily aligned with the brain-to-outcome relationship, most foundation
models are suboptimal to the downstream task, such as predicting disease
outcomes. By capitalizing on rich environmental variables and demographic data
along with an unprecedented amount of functional neuroimages, we form the brain
modeling as a multitask learning and present a scalable model architecture for
(i) multitask pretraining by tokenizing multiple brain-environment interactions
(BEI) and (ii) semi-supervised finetuning by assigning pseudo-labels of
pretrained BEI. We have evaluated our foundation model on a variety of
applications, including sex prediction, human behavior recognition, and disease
early diagnosis of Autism, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and
{Schizophrenia}, where promising results indicate the great potential to
facilitate current neuroimaging applications in clinical routines.

Method: ADPO框架通过引入软偏好概率、引用政策锚定和列表建模来改进传统的直接偏好优化方法。

Result: ADPO在上下文赌博机和序列强化学习中显著提高了性能，特别是在极端噪声和污染下。

Conclusion: ADPO通过引入锚定和列表平滑技术，在处理带噪声的偏好学习任务中表现出色，并在不同的环境中显示出优越性。

Abstract: Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO) is a unified framework that
generalizes Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with soft preferences,
reference-policy anchoring, and groupwise extensions. While standard DPO
assumes hard binary labels and pairwise comparisons, ADPO introduces: (i) soft
preference probabilities that encode uncertainty and mitigate gradient drift;
(ii) arbitrary reference-policy anchors that stabilize training via groupwise
shift invariance and implicit KL regularization; and (iii) listwise preference
modeling through Plackett-Luce distributions. We prove that DPO, Bradley-Terry
objectives, and Top-1-vs-Rest formulations emerge as special cases. ADPO yields
three practical variants: pairwise anchored Soft-DPO, listwise anchored
Soft-DPO with raw rewards, and KDE-based listwise smoothing for heavy-tailed
noise. In contextual bandits, anchoring improves WinMass by 38-63% over
standard DPO, while KDE smoothing achieves 0.68 vs 0.32 under heavy-tailed
contamination (112% relative gain). In sequential reinforcement learning
(CartPole, LunarLander), anchoring improves noisy-preference performance by
15-29%, confirming transfer from single-step to multi-step settings.
Experiments with 10-256 parameter models provide clear guidance: use pairwise
anchored Soft-DPO for clean or moderate noise, and KDE-based listwise ADPO for
extreme contamination.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MLX框架的性能评估，尤其是在Apple Silicon设备上对transformer模型的推理延迟进行比较，如BERT等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型和机器学习在小型设备上的广泛应用，急需能利用设备硬件的框架和方法。

Method: 通过创建名为MLX-transformers的框架，评估不同transformer模型的性能，比较其在MLX和Pytorch下的推理延迟。

Result: 研究显示，MLX在支持transformer模型的运行方面具备高效性，尤其是在Apple Silicon设备上。

Conclusion: MLX展示了在Apple生态系统中高效且便捷的设备端机器学习应用的潜力。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种噪声稳健的策略优化框架，针对强化学习中的奖励噪声问题，提供了理论和实践上的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的RLHF方法对来自不一致或错误奖励的噪声敏感，本文旨在探讨噪声与群体基础政策优化方法之间的互动，以提高模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Method: 通过显式建模奖励腐败为伯努利噪声，进行噪声校正以去偏学习信号，并验证该方法在标准奖励模型使用中的有效性。

Result: 本文提出了一种噪声稳健的群体相对策略优化方法（GRPO）及其改进版（Dr.GRPO），该方法通过显式建模奖励腐败（如伯努利噪声）来提高强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）或可验证奖励（RLVR）的鲁棒性。在估计奖励翻转概率后进行噪声校正，从而去偏学习信号，最终获得无偏梯度估计。理论分析表明，群体基础的方法固有地减轻个体级别的噪声，而我们的校正策略进一步增强了这种鲁棒性。在数学和代码任务中观察到一致性改善，在真实奖励模型条件下，数学任务的准确率提高了6.7个百分点，代码任务则提高了1.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 本工作通过将标签噪声校正的思想引入现代RLHF，提供了理论见解和实用算法，旨在应对嘈杂的实际环境中的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or verifiable rewards
(RLVR), the standard paradigm for aligning LLMs or building recent SOTA
reasoning models, is highly sensitive to noise from inconsistent or erroneous
rewards. Yet, the interaction between such noise and widely used group-based
policy optimization methods remains underexplored. We introduce a noise-robust
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Done Right GRPO (Dr.GRPO)
framework that explicitly models reward corruption as Bernoulli noise. Our
method applies noise correction after estimating reward flip probabilities to
debias the learning signal, yielding provably unbiased gradient estimates.
Theoretical analysis shows that group-based methods inherently mitigate
individual-level noise, and our correction strategy amplifies this robustness.
Empirically, we observe consistent improvements across math and code tasks when
applying our noise correction to standard reward model usage, with particular
gains of up to 6.7 percentage points in accuracy on math tasks and 1.5 on code
tasks under realistic reward model conditions. This work bridges label-noise
correction from supervised learning with modern RLHF, offering both theoretical
insights and a practical algorithm for noisy real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决应用强化学习于离线设置中的优化不平衡与熵降低问题，以提高样本效率和稳定性。

Method: 提出了一种名为BAPO的动态调整剪切边界的方法，以平衡正负贡献，保持熵并稳定优化过程。

Result: 在AIME 2024和AIME 2025基准测试中，BAPO模型在多个指标上超越了其他同规模模型以及一些领先的专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO模型在多个离线策略场景中表现出快速、稳定和数据高效的训练效果，超越了开源和一些领先的专有系统。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

TL;DR: NeuroAda 是一种新颖的 PEFT 方法，通过旁路连接实现高效的细粒度微调，以较少的参数和低内存使用达到了优秀的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法存在记忆效率和适应精度之间的权衡，急需一种新方法来平衡这两者。

Method: NeuroAda 通过识别重要参数并为其引入旁路连接，限定微调更新的参数，保持原有模型参数不变。

Result: NeuroAda 在 23 个以上的任务中表现出色，训练参数少于 0.02%，CUDA 内存使用降低了 60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda 在保留高效内存的同时，实现了细粒度的模型微调，其出色表现体现在多个自然语言生成和理解任务上。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Motivation: 解决神经算子在分布外（OOD）泛化性能较差的问题，同时保持其低参数成本和快速推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种对抗教师-学生蒸馏框架，其中可微分的数值求解器监督一个紧凑的神经算子，利用PGD风格的主动采样循环搜索最坏情况输入。

Result: 在Burgers和Navier-Stokes系统上的实验表明，对抗蒸馏显著提高了OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗蒸馏不仅提升了OOD鲁棒性，还保持了神经算子的高效性能。

Abstract: Nonlinear PDE solvers require fine space-time discretizations and local
linearizations, leading to high memory cost and slow runtimes. Neural operators
such as FNOs and DeepONets offer fast single-shot inference by learning
function-to-function mappings and truncating high-frequency components, but
they suffer from poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, often failing
on inputs outside the training distribution. We propose an adversarial
teacher-student distillation framework in which a differentiable numerical
solver supervises a compact neural operator while a PGD-style active sampling
loop searches for worst-case inputs under smoothness and energy constraints to
expand the training set. Using differentiable spectral solvers enables
gradient-based adversarial search and stabilizes sample mining. Experiments on
Burgers and Navier-Stokes systems demonstrate that adversarial distillation
substantially improves OOD robustness while preserving the low parameter cost
and fast inference of neural operators.

Result: 本文提出了一种新颖的编码-再分解方法，用于时间序列的异常检测。在此方法中，将编码的表示分解为稳定和辅助表示，从而在训练受污染的时间序列时增强鲁棒性。此外，本文还提出了一种基于互信息的新指标，来替代重构误差以识别异常。我们的提案在八个常用的多变量和单变量时间序列基准测试中表现出竞争力或最先进的性能，并在不同的污染比率的时间序列中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 我们的提案在多种基准测试中展示了优异的性能，证明了其在不同污染条件下的有效性。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is important in modern large-scale systems and
is applied in a variety of domains to analyze and monitor the operation of
diverse systems. Unsupervised approaches have received widespread interest, as
they do not require anomaly labels during training, thus avoiding potentially
high costs and having wider applications. Among these, autoencoders have
received extensive attention. They use reconstruction errors from compressed
representations to define anomaly scores. However, representations learned by
autoencoders are sensitive to anomalies in training time series, causing
reduced accuracy. We propose a novel encode-then-decompose paradigm, where we
decompose the encoded representation into stable and auxiliary representations,
thereby enhancing the robustness when training with contaminated time series.
In addition, we propose a novel mutual information based metric to replace the
reconstruction errors for identifying anomalies. Our proposal demonstrates
competitive or state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used multi- and
univariate time series benchmarks and exhibits robustness to time series with
different contamination ratios.

Motivation: 解决决策树在处理非线性特征时的复杂结构问题，同时保持可解释性。

Method: 提出ShapeCART算法学习Shape Generalized Tree (SGT)

Result: SGTs通过应用可学习的轴对齐形状函数，能够实现丰富的非线性分割，且在各类数据集上展示了优越的性能与较小的模型规模。

Conclusion: SGTs不仅提升了模型的表现，还增强了人类对模型决策机制的理解和可视化解释能力。

Abstract: Decision trees are prized for their interpretability and strong performance
on tabular data. Yet, their reliance on simple axis-aligned linear splits often
forces deep, complex structures to capture non-linear feature effects,
undermining human comprehension of the constructed tree. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel generalization of a decision tree, the Shape
Generalized Tree (SGT), in which each internal node applies a learnable
axis-aligned shape function to a single feature, enabling rich, non-linear
partitioning in one split. As users can easily visualize each node's shape
function, SGTs are inherently interpretable and provide intuitive, visual
explanations of the model's decision mechanisms. To learn SGTs from data, we
propose ShapeCART, an efficient induction algorithm for SGTs. We further extend
the SGT framework to bivariate shape functions (S$^2$GT) and multi-way trees
(SGT$_K$), and present Shape$^2$CART and ShapeCART$_K$, extensions to ShapeCART
for learning S$^2$GTs and SGT$_K$s, respectively. Experiments on various
datasets show that SGTs achieve superior performance with reduced model size
compared to traditional axis-aligned linear trees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，联邦学习（FL）在后门攻击方面存在脆弱性，尤其是新兴的后门关键层（BC层）方法。现有方法由于缺乏层之间关系的考量，因此效率低且易被检测。

Method: 采用基于强化学习的POLAR方法，动态学习攻击策略，通过策略梯度更新优化层选择，利用Bernoulli抽样实现轻量化。

Result: POLAR通过引入正则化约束限制修改层数，避免过大的攻击足迹，从而确保了攻击的隐蔽性，并有效提升了后门攻击成功率。

Conclusion: POLAR显著优于最新攻击方法，对抗六种最先进的防御方案可提升多达40%的效果。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training across multiple
clients without exposing local data, but its distributed feature makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Despite early FL backdoor attacks modifying
entire models, recent studies have explored the concept of backdoor-critical
(BC) layers, which poison the chosen influential layers to maintain
stealthiness while achieving high effectiveness. However, existing BC layers
approaches rely on rule-based selection without consideration of the
interrelations between layers, making them ineffective and prone to detection
by advanced defenses. In this paper, we propose POLAR (POlicy-based LAyerwise
Reinforcement learning), the first pipeline to creatively adopt RL to solve the
BC layer selection problem in layer-wise backdoor attack. Different from other
commonly used RL paradigm, POLAR is lightweight with Bernoulli sampling. POLAR
dynamically learns an attack strategy, optimizing layer selection using policy
gradient updates based on backdoor success rate (BSR) improvements. To ensure
stealthiness, we introduce a regularization constraint that limits the number
of modified layers by penalizing large attack footprints. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that POLAR outperforms the latest attack methods by up to 40%
against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses.

Conclusion: 本研究挑战了通用课程策略的观点，提供了针对不同模型和任务的可行指导，优先考虑决策不确定样本可以提升学习效果。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) - ordering training data from easy to hard - has
become a popular strategy for improving reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). Yet prior work employs disparate difficulty metrics and training
setups, leaving open fundamental questions: When does curriculum help? Which
direction - forward or reverse - is better? And does the answer depend on what
we measure? We address these questions through a unified offline evaluation
framework that decomposes curriculum difficulty into five complementary
dimensions: Problem Difficulty, Model Surprisal, Confidence Margin, Predictive
Uncertainty, and Decision Variability. Through controlled post-training
experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,
and Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -
the relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on
model capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples
at different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task
demands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final
representations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate
internal states such as confidence and uncertainty. Our findings challenge the
notion of a universal curriculum strategy and offer actionable guidance across
model and task regimes, with some metrics indicating that prioritizing
decision-uncertain samples can further enhance learning outcomes.

Conclusion: 我们的方法在控制与生成质量之间取得了良好的平衡，提供了可用代码以促进音乐领域的进一步探索。

Abstract: Controllable music generation remains a significant challenge, with existing
methods often requiring model retraining or introducing audible artifacts. We
introduce MusicRFM, a framework that adapts Recursive Feature Machines (RFMs)
to enable fine-grained, interpretable control over frozen, pre-trained music
models by directly steering their internal activations. RFMs analyze a model's
internal gradients to produce interpretable "concept directions", or specific
axes in the activation space that correspond to musical attributes like notes
or chords. We first train lightweight RFM probes to discover these directions
within MusicGen's hidden states; then, during inference, we inject them back
into the model to guide the generation process in real-time without per-step
optimization. We present advanced mechanisms for this control, including
dynamic, time-varying schedules and methods for the simultaneous enforcement of
multiple musical properties. Our method successfully navigates the trade-off
between control and generation quality: we can increase the accuracy of
generating a target musical note from 0.23 to 0.82, while text prompt adherence
remains within approximately 0.02 of the unsteered baseline, demonstrating
effective control with minimal impact on prompt fidelity. We release code to
encourage further exploration on RFMs in the music domain.

Motivation: 传统的Granger因果检验基于线性模型，难以检测非线性因果关系，且现有方法通常依赖于 causal sufficiency 和已知干预目标的假设。

Method: 利用跨环境的异质性来缓解潜在混淆的影响，并以边缘级别的粒度区分干预环境与非干预环境。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，InvarGC相较于最先进的方法表现出了竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新方法Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC)，有效克服了潜在混淆和干预环境区分的问题，恢复了不变的因果关系。

Abstract: Granger causality is widely used for causal structure discovery in complex
systems from multivariate time series data. Traditional Granger causality tests
based on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal
relationships. Therefore, numerous recent studies have investigated non-linear
Granger causality methods, achieving improved performance. However, these
methods often rely on two key assumptions: causal sufficiency and known
interventional targets. Causal sufficiency assumes the absence of latent
confounders, yet their presence can introduce spurious correlations. Moreover,
real-world time series data usually come from heterogeneous environments,
without prior knowledge of interventions. Therefore, in practice, it is
difficult to distinguish intervened environments from non-intervened ones, and
even harder to identify which variables or timesteps are affected. To address
these challenges, we propose Invariant Granger Causality (InvarGC), which
leverages cross-environment heterogeneity to mitigate the effects of latent
confounding and to distinguish intervened from non-intervened environments with
edge-level granularity, thereby recovering invariant causal relations. In
addition, we establish the identifiability under these conditions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
competitive performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了依赖于合成数据的人工智能系统中的隐性腐败风险，强调了对隐性威胁的新安全协议的需求。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly fine-tuned on synthetic data,
there is a critical risk of subtle misalignments spreading through
interconnected AI systems. This paper investigates subliminal corruption, which
we define as undesirable traits are transmitted through semantically neutral
data, bypassing standard safety checks. While this phenomenon has been
identified, a quantitative understanding of its dynamics is missing. To address
this gap, we present a systematic study of the scaling laws, thresholds, and
mechanisms of subliminal corruption using a teacher-student setup with GPT-2.
Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) subliminal corruption causes
behavioral crossover, degrading the model's overall alignment, not just the
targeted trait; (2) alignment fails in a sharp phase transition at a critical
threshold of poisoned data, rather than degrading gradually; and (3)
interpretability analysis shows the corruption mechanism mimics the model's
natural fine-tuning process, making it difficult to detect. These results
demonstrate a critical vulnerability in AI systems that rely on synthetic data
and highlight the need for new safety protocols that can account for latent
threats.

Abstract: In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.

Conclusion: 特征空间适应通过轻量级特征级转换来增强模型在分布变化下的泛化能力，同时保留了预训练的表示，改善了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a common issue in model fine-tuning, especially
when the downstream domain contains limited labeled data or differs greatly
from the pre-training distribution. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods operate in the weight space by modifying or augmenting the pre-trained
model's parameters, which can yield models overly specialized to the available
downstream data. To mitigate the risk of overwriting pre-trained knowledge and
enhance robustness, we propose to fine-tune the pre-trained model in the
feature space. Two new fine-tuning methods are proposed: LoRFA (Low-Rank
Feature Adaptation) and VeFA (Vector-Based Feature Adaptation). Feature space
adaptation is inspired by the idea of effect equivalence modeling (EEM) of
downstream lurking variables causing distribution shifts, which posits that
unobserved factors can be represented as the total equivalent amount on
observed features. By compensating for the effects of downstream lurking
variables via a lightweight feature-level transformation, the pre-trained
representations can be preserved, which improves model generalization under
distribution shift. We evaluate LoRFA and VeFA versus LoRA on image
classification, NLU, and NLG, covering both standard fine-tuning metrics and
robustness. Feature space adaptation achieves comparable fine-tuning results
and consistently stronger robustness.

Motivation: 为了解决经典部分监控模型在实际应用中的局限性，特别是处理无限结果空间和非随机对抗性场景的需求。

Method: 采用探索-优化方法，解析线性部分监控模型的非随机有限行动版本，分析懊悔界限。

Result: 本文提出了一种线性部分监控的新模型，它不仅能处理无限结果空间，还对损失和观察施加了线性结构。针对这种模型，作者探讨了一种简单的探索-优化方法，以有效实现非随机（对抗性）有限行动版本的问题。通过这一方法，作者得出了比以往更清晰的懊悔界限，这些界限依赖于游戏结构，并且包含了实例特定的量，反映出观察与损失之间的对齐程度。特别地，界限在易游戏中实现了标准的\(\sqrt{T}\) 速率，而在难游戏中为\(T^{2/3}\) 速率，\(T\) 为时间范围。此外，作者还在一系列旧有与新型部分信息设置中对这些界限进行了实例化，并展示了在有趣的情况下，所取得的对游戏结构的依赖性可能是紧的。

Conclusion: 本文的线性部分监控模型有效地处理了非随机有限行动问题，并在多种情境下验证了理论上的懊悔界限，尤其在对游戏结构的依赖性上表现突出。

Abstract: In contrast to the classic formulation of partial monitoring, linear partial
monitoring can model infinite outcome spaces, while imposing a linear structure
on both the losses and the observations. This setting can be viewed as a
generalization of linear bandits where loss and feedback are decoupled in a
flexible manner. In this work, we address a nonstochastic (adversarial),
finite-actions version of the problem through a simple instance of the
exploration-by-optimization method that is amenable to efficient
implementation. We derive regret bounds that depend on the game structure in a
more transparent manner than previous theoretical guarantees for this paradigm.
Our bounds feature instance-specific quantities that reflect the degree of
alignment between observations and losses, and resemble known guarantees in the
stochastic setting. Notably, they achieve the standard $\sqrt{T}$ rate in easy
(locally observable) games and $T^{2/3}$ in hard (globally observable) games,
where $T$ is the time horizon. We instantiate these bounds in a selection of
old and new partial information settings subsumed by this model, and illustrate
that the achieved dependence on the game structure can be tight in interesting
cases.

Abstract: Integration of diverse data will be a pivotal step towards improving
scientific explorations in many disciplines. This work establishes a
vision-language model (VLM) that encodes videos with text input in order to
classify various behaviors of a mouse existing in and engaging with their
environment. Importantly, this model produces a behavioral vector over time for
each subject and for each session the subject undergoes. The output is a
valuable dataset that few programs are able to produce with as high accuracy
and with minimal user input. Specifically, we use the open-source Qwen2.5-VL
model and enhance its performance through prompts, in-context learning (ICL)
with labeled examples, and frame-level preprocessing. We found that each of
these methods contributes to improved classification, and that combining them
results in strong F1 scores across all behaviors, including rare classes like
freezing and fleeing, without any model fine-tuning. Overall, this model will
support interdisciplinary researchers studying mouse behavior by enabling them
to integrate diverse behavioral features, measured across multiple time points
and environments, into a comprehensive dataset that can address complex
research questions.

Result: 本研究提出了对随机自然梯度变分推断（NGVI）的理论分析，特别关注于非共轭似然的情况。通过均值场参数化，研究分别从三个方面推进NGVI的理论理解：一是推导了变分损失相对于适当镜像映射的相对光滑性所需的充分条件；二是提出了一种修改后的NGVI算法，结合了非欧几里得投影，并证明了其全局非渐进收敛性；三是在对似然的附加结构假设下，揭示了变分损失的隐藏凸性属性，并确立了NGVI快速全局收敛至全局最优解的结果。这些发现为在复杂推断情境中NGVI的几何特性和收敛行为提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在困难推断情境中理解NGVI的几何特性和收敛行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference (NGVI) is a widely used
method for approximating posterior distribution in probabilistic models.
Despite its empirical success and foundational role in variational inference,
its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly in the case of
non-conjugate likelihoods. While NGVI has been shown to be a special instance
of Stochastic Mirror Descent, and recent work has provided convergence
guarantees using relative smoothness and strong convexity for conjugate models,
these results do not extend to the non-conjugate setting, where the variational
loss becomes non-convex and harder to analyze. In this work, we focus on
mean-field parameterization and advance the theoretical understanding of NGVI
in three key directions. First, we derive sufficient conditions under which the
variational loss satisfies relative smoothness with respect to a suitable
mirror map. Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI
algorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global
non-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional
structural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity
properties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of
NGVI to a global optimum. These results provide new insights into the geometry
and convergence behavior of NGVI in challenging inference settings.

Motivation: 探讨多任务后训练大语言模型时，任务间梯度不平衡对优化过程的影响。

Method: 通过对多任务学习中的梯度大小和学习收益进行对比分析，检视不同任务间的固有差异。

Result: 证明了在强化学习后训练中，大梯度任务对更新的偏见可能导致学习收益不如小梯度任务，因此对数据集混合方法提出了警告。

Conclusion: 大梯度任务的影响需要进一步研究，并呼吁在未来的工作中为大语言模型设计更合理的梯度校正机制。

Abstract: Multi-task post-training of large language models (LLMs) is typically
performed by mixing datasets from different tasks and optimizing them jointly.
This approach implicitly assumes that all tasks contribute gradients of similar
magnitudes; when this assumption fails, optimization becomes biased toward
large-gradient tasks. In this paper, however, we show that this assumption
fails in RL post-training: certain tasks produce significantly larger
gradients, thus biasing updates toward those tasks. Such gradient imbalance
would be justified only if larger gradients implied larger learning gains on
the tasks (i.e., larger performance improvements) -- but we find this is not
true. Large-gradient tasks can achieve similar or even much lower learning
gains than small-gradient ones. Further analyses reveal that these gradient
imbalances cannot be explained by typical training statistics such as training
rewards or advantages, suggesting that they arise from the inherent differences
between tasks. This cautions against naive dataset mixing and calls for future
work on principled gradient-level corrections for LLMs.

Motivation: 解决传统机器去学习方法中存在的去学习效果与模型保真度之间的权衡以及其他相关挑战。

Method: 将机器去学习重新定义为多目标优化问题，引入CUP算法，通过可控的枢轴机制和超参数进行导航。

Result: 本研究提出了一种新方法，旨在改进机器去学习（MU）的效果。传统的方法在去学习效果与模型保真度之间存在权衡，导致了过度遗忘、缺乏细粒度控制和缺乏评价指标等主要挑战。为了解决这些问题，研究者将MU重新定义为一个多目标优化（MOO）问题，并引入了一种新算法——可控去学习的枢轴梯度（CUP），该算法通过独特的枢轴机制在整个帕累托前沿上进行可控导航，而不是仅收敛到单一解。这种导航由一个直观的超参数“去学习强度”控制，从而可以精确选择期望的权衡。实验结果表明，CUP在多个视觉任务上表现出比现有方法更优的帕累托最优解集。

Conclusion: CUP算法能够有效控制去学习过程，生成更优的帕累托最优解集，适用于多种视觉任务。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model. However, approximate unlearning methods, often formulated as a
single-objective optimization (SOO) problem, face a critical trade-off between
unlearning efficacy and model fidelity. This leads to three primary challenges:
the risk of over-forgetting, a lack of fine-grained control over the unlearning
process, and the absence of metrics to holistically evaluate the trade-off. To
address these issues, we reframe MU as a multi-objective optimization (MOO)
problem. We then introduce a novel algorithm, Controllable Unlearning by
Pivoting Gradient (CUP), which features a unique pivoting mechanism. Unlike
traditional MOO methods that converge to a single solution, CUP's mechanism is
designed to controllably navigate the entire Pareto frontier. This navigation
is governed by a single intuitive hyperparameter, the `unlearning intensity',
which allows for precise selection of a desired trade-off. To evaluate this
capability, we adopt the hypervolume indicator, a metric that captures both the
quality and diversity of the entire set of solutions an algorithm can generate.
Our experimental results demonstrate that CUP produces a superior set of
Pareto-optimal solutions, consistently outperforming existing methods across
various vision tasks.

Abstract: Infants discover categories, detect novelty, and adapt to new contexts
without supervision -- a challenge for current machine learning. We present a
brain-inspired perspective on configurations, a finite-resolution clustering
framework that uses a single resolution parameter and attraction-repulsion
dynamics to yield hierarchical organization, novelty sensitivity, and flexible
adaptation. To evaluate these properties, we introduce mheatmap, which provides
proportional heatmaps and a reassignment algorithm to fairly assess
multi-resolution and dynamic behavior. Across datasets, configurations are
competitive on standard clustering metrics, achieve 87% AUC in novelty
detection, and show 35% better stability during dynamic category evolution.
These results position configurations as a principled computational model of
early cognitive categorization and a step toward brain-inspired AI.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are a class of potentially powerful,
general-purpose tools for time series forecasting and related temporal tasks,
but their behavior is strongly shaped by subtle inductive biases in their
design. Rather than developing a new model and claiming that it is better than
existing TSFMs, e.g., by winning on existing well-established benchmarks, our
objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how
these biases can be intuitive or very counterintuitive, depending on properties
of the model and data. We also illustrate in a case study on outlier handling
how multiple biases can interact in complex ways; and we discuss implications
of our results for learning the bitter lesson and building TSFMs.

Result: SPOT方法显著提高了决策树策略的计算效率和可扩展性，且每次迭代都能产生最优决策树。

Conclusion: SPOT方法同时实现了可解释性和可扩展性，以显著更快的速度提供高质量的策略。

Abstract: Interpretable reinforcement learning policies are essential for high-stakes
decision-making, yet optimizing decision tree policies in Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) remains challenging. We propose SPOT, a novel method for
computing decision tree policies, which formulates the optimization problem as
a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). To enhance efficiency, we employ a
reduced-space branch-and-bound approach that decouples the MDP dynamics from
tree-structure constraints, enabling efficient parallel search. This
significantly improves runtime and scalability compared to previous methods.
Our approach ensures that each iteration yields the optimal decision tree.
Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SPOT achieves
substantial speedup and scales to larger MDPs with a significantly higher
number of states. The resulting decision tree policies are interpretable and
compact, maintaining transparency without compromising performance. These
results demonstrate that our approach simultaneously achieves interpretability
and scalability, delivering high-quality policies an order of magnitude faster
than existing approaches.

Conclusion: GraMixC在处理复杂数据任务中表现出色，成为新的性能基准。

Abstract: Humans possess an innate ability to group objects by similarity, a cognitive
mechanism that clustering algorithms aim to emulate. Recent advances in
community detection have enabled the discovery of configurations -- valid
hierarchical clusterings across multiple resolution scales -- without requiring
labeled data. In this paper, we formally characterize these configurations and
identify similar emergent structures in register tokens within Vision
Transformers. Unlike register tokens, configurations exhibit lower redundancy
and eliminate the need for ad hoc selection. They can be learned through
unsupervised or self-supervised methods, yet their selection or composition
remains specific to the downstream task and input. Building on these insights,
we introduce GraMixC, a plug-and-play module that extracts configurations,
aligns them using our Reverse Merge/Split (RMS) technique, and fuses them via
attention heads before forwarding them to any downstream predictor. On the DSN1
16S rRNA cultivation-media prediction task, GraMixC improves the R2 score from
0.6 to 0.9 across multiple methods, setting a new state of the art. We further
validate GraMixC on standard tabular benchmarks, where it consistently
outperforms single-resolution and static-feature baselines.

Abstract: Deep ensembles deliver state-of-the-art, reliable uncertainty quantification,
but their heavy computational and memory requirements hinder their practical
deployments to real applications such as on-device AI. Knowledge distillation
compresses an ensemble into small student models, but existing techniques
struggle to preserve uncertainty partly because reducing the size of DNNs
typically results in variation reduction. To resolve this limitation, we
introduce a new method of distribution distillation (i.e. compressing a teacher
ensemble into a student distribution instead of a student ensemble) called
Gaussian distillation, which estimates the distribution of a teacher ensemble
through a special Gaussian process called the deep latent factor model (DLF) by
treating each member of the teacher ensemble as a realization of a certain
stochastic process. The mean and covariance functions in the DLF model are
estimated stably by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By using
multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed Gaussian
distillation outperforms existing baselines. In addition, we illustrate that
Gaussian distillation works well for fine-tuning of language models and
distribution shift problems.

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising
opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for
automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders
the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing
functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware
Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments
of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering
Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and
wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of
QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially
incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional
rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated
module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then
abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments
which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules.
Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct
signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from
incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from
conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog
code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of
the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading
open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Loopholing机制有效提高了离散扩散模型在文本生成中的表现，提供了向高质量非自回归文本生成的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models offer a promising alternative to autoregressive
generation through parallel decoding, but they suffer from a sampling wall:
once categorical sampling occurs, rich distributional information collapses
into one-hot vectors and cannot be propagated across steps, forcing subsequent
steps to operate with limited information. To mitigate this problem, we
introduce Loopholing, a novel and simple mechanism that preserves this
information via a deterministic latent pathway, leading to Loopholing Discrete
Diffusion Models (LDDMs). Trained efficiently with a self-conditioning
strategy, LDDMs achieve substantial gains-reducing generative perplexity by up
to 61% over prior baselines, closing (and in some cases surpassing) the gap
with autoregressive models, and producing more coherent text. Applied to
reasoning tasks, LDDMs also improve performance on arithmetic benchmarks such
as Countdown and Game of 24. These results also indicate that loopholing
mitigates idle steps and oscillations, providing a scalable path toward
high-quality non-autoregressive text generation.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Machine learning models are essential for decision-making and risk
assessment, requiring highly reliable predictions in terms of both
discrimination and calibration. While calibration often receives less
attention, it is crucial for critical decisions, such as those in clinical
predictions. We introduce a novel calibration pipeline that leverages an
ensemble of calibration functions trained on clusters of learned
representations of the input samples to enhance overall calibration. This
approach not only improves the calibration score of various methods from 82.28%
up to 100% but also introduces a unique matching metric that ensures model
selection optimizes both discrimination and calibration. Our generic scheme
adapts to any underlying representation, clustering, calibration methods and
metric, offering flexibility and superior performance across commonly used
calibration methods.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention

long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在预测准确性方面表现优异，但准确性并不决定实际价值。本文分析了不同预测形式对操作任务的支持能力，并指出大多数现有模型仅生成点预测或参数预测，而许多任务需要保留时间依赖性的重要轨迹集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同形式的预测（如点预测、参数预测等）如何影响其在实际操作中的应用能力。

Method: 对现有的时间序列基础模型进行调查和分类，分析其预测形式的转换条件。

Result: 找到预测类型转换的条件及其局限性，提供与任务匹配的评估框架，明确预测类型的实用性。

Conclusion: 预测类型的选择而非准确性，成为决定实际应用效用的关键。

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) achieve strong forecast accuracy, yet
accuracy alone does not determine practical value. The form of a forecast --
point, quantile, parametric, or trajectory ensemble -- fundamentally constrains
which operational tasks it can support. We survey recent TSFMs and find that
two-thirds produce only point or parametric forecasts, while many operational
tasks require trajectory ensembles that preserve temporal dependence. We
establish when forecast types can be converted and when they cannot: trajectory
ensembles convert to simpler forms via marginalization without additional
assumptions, but the reverse requires imposing temporal dependence through
copulas or conformal methods. We prove that marginals cannot determine
path-dependent event probabilities -- infinitely many joint distributions share
identical marginals but yield different answers to operational questions. We
map six fundamental forecasting tasks to minimal sufficient forecast types and
provide a task-aligned evaluation framework. Our analysis clarifies when
forecast type, not accuracy, differentiates practical utility.

<details>

Motivation: 线性上下文赌博机（如LinUCB）在推荐系统中应用广泛，但其训练、推理和内存成本随着特征维度和动作空间规模的增长而增加，因此亟需解决设计矩阵更新和存储的瓶颈问题。

Method: 通过逆正则化设计矩阵的动态低秩参数化，结合一种投影器分裂积分器，维持逆矩阵的稳定更新，无需直接形成整个矩阵。

Result: 引入了一种可扩展的LinUCB算法，该算法通过动态低秩参数化和数值稳定的更新方法实现了快速且内存高效的操作。

Conclusion: 所提算法在推荐系统数据集上的实验结果展示了其高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Linear contextual bandits, especially LinUCB, are widely used in recommender
systems. However, its training, inference, and memory costs grow with feature
dimensionality and the size of the action space. The key bottleneck becomes the
need to update, invert and store a design matrix that absorbs contextual
information from interaction history. In this paper, we introduce Scalable
LinUCB, the algorithm that enables fast and memory efficient operations with
the inverse regularized design matrix. We achieve this through a dynamical
low-rank parametrization of its inverse Cholesky-style factors. We derive
numerically stable rank-1 and batched updates that maintain the inverse without
directly forming the entire matrix. To control memory growth, we employ a
projector-splitting integrator for dynamical low-rank approximation, yielding
average per-step update cost $O(dr)$ and memory $O(dr)$ for approximation rank
$r$. Inference complexity of the suggested algorithm is $O(dr)$ per action
evaluation. Experiments on recommender system datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

TL;DR: ADAligner是一个动态品质感知的图文对齐框架，解决了现有对齐器的多对多关系处理和脆弱性问题，优于传统方法，在多项任务中表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有图文对齐方法在应对多对多关系和噪声监督时的局限性，并提升图文表示学习的质量和效率。

Method: ADAligner采用动态质量感知策略，实时评估对齐可靠性，根据数据质量调整对齐目标，促进多样性和语义准确性的平衡。

Result: 本文提出了ADAligner，一个动态且质量感知的图文对齐框架，用于解决现有CLIP风格图文对齐器在处理文本属性图时存在的局限性，如节点与文本之间的多对多关系及静态对齐目标的脆弱性。ADAligner通过实时评估批次级对齐可靠性并根据监督质量调整优化策略，促进干净监督下的多对多对齐，困难情况下强调可靠的一对一对齐。此外，该方法在九个多样化的文本属性图数据集上进行了全面实验，显著优于现有对齐器，在处理噪声监督时保持强大的鲁棒性，并加速了预训练过程。

Conclusion: ADAligner通过动态调整，兼顾多对多和一对一对齐，展现出良好的鲁棒性和加速预训练的能力，适用于真实世界的图文表示学习。

Abstract: Pre-training Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) on text-attributed graphs (TAGs)
is central to web-scale applications such as search, recommendation, and
knowledge discovery. However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two
key limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes
and texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world
graphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to
varying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,
these limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many
alignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies
sacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.
To address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware
graph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive
many-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision
quality. ADAligner estimates batch-level alignment reliability in real time and
adapts its optimization accordingly, promoting soft, subgraph-level
many-to-many alignment when supervision is clean, while emphasizing reliable
one-to-one alignment by dynamically filtering low-confidence pairs under noise.
Theoretically, we prove that this dynamic mechanism forms a stable negative
feedback process, ensuring convergence and robustness. Comprehensive
experiments on nine diverse TAG datasets demonstrate that ADAligner
consistently outperforms prior graph-text aligners on zero-/few-shot node
classification, link prediction and cross-modal retrieval tasks. It maintains
strong robustness under noisy supervision and accelerates pre-training by
approximately 2 to 3 times compared to multimodal baselines, establishing a
scalable and reliable foundation for graph-text representation learning in
real-world web environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种名为CPSVD的新型压缩方法，能够更有效地压缩大型语言模型，通过智能分割和适应性分配压缩率，显著提高了压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的参数规模巨大，传统的SVD压缩方法存在局限，急需更有效的压缩技术，因此提出了CPSVD方法来克服这些缺陷。

Method: CPSVD方法通过智能分割参数矩阵，保留分解误差较高的列，并仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，同时确定最佳平衡点以最小化误差。

Result: 本研究提出了一种名为CPSVD的新方法，旨在改进基于奇异值分解(SVD)的大型语言模型(LLM)压缩技术。传统的SVD方法未能考虑参数矩阵中不同部分的奇异值分解误差差异，导致压缩效果不理想。CPSVD通过智能分割参数矩阵，直接保留高分解误差的矩阵列，仅对低分解误差的列应用SVD，从而优化压缩过程。该方法还根据LLM内部不同矩阵的分解误差异质性，适应性地为该层内模块分配非均匀的压缩率，同时保持目标层级压缩比。

Conclusion: CPSVD方法在压缩大型语言模型方面表现优越，能够降低困惑度并提高零-shot任务的准确性，优于其他基于SVD的压缩方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) faces a critical
bottleneck in their immense size, necessitating efficient compression
techniques. While Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a promising approach,
existing SVD-based methods treat the entire parameter matrix uniformly,
overlooking that SVD approximation errors vary significantly across different
matrix parts, which often leads to suboptimal compression. To address this, we
propose \textbf{C}olumn-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{S}ingular \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{D}ecomposition (CPSVD), a novel method that refines SVD-based LLM
compression by intelligently segmenting the parameter matrix. Unlike
traditional SVD, CPSVD identifies and directly preserves matrix columns with
high decomposition errors, applying SVD only to columns with low decomposition
errors, while precisely determining the optimal balance point between these two
strategies to minimize error. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent
heterogeneity in decomposition errors across different matrices within an LLM,
CPSVD adaptively allocates non-uniform compression rates to modules within that
layer, while adhering to a target layer-wise compression ratio, thereby further
enhancing compression performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPSVD
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SVD-based LLM compression methods,
achieving lower perplexity and higher accuracy on zero-shot tasks.

Motivation: 在大语言模型压缩领域，如何有效确定线性模块的秩以满足全局压缩比约束是一个关键问题。

Method: 基于自适应掩码设计与额外损失函数的构建，ARA能够在保持线性模块高效映射与更新的同时，优化参数选择。

Result: 提出了一种自适应秩分配（ARA）方法，通过更有效的掩码设计和额外损失函数，实现了更优化的参数选择和压缩效果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ARA在LLaMA2-7B模型上实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了压缩后的性能表现。

Abstract: In the field of large language model (LLM) compression, singular value
decomposition (SVD) is a widely studied and adopted low-rank decomposition
technique. Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules
in LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied
independently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio
constraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules
becomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms
and mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.
However, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic
algorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while
mask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between
singular value spectra and trainable parameters. More importantly, current
methods overlook the key property that the gain function is non-smooth at a
compression ratio of 1, which often leads the training process to suboptimal
local minima. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Rank Allocation
(ARA) method. Specifically, (1) ARA introduces a dedicated mask design that
enables efficient mapping and updating between retained ranks and trainable
parameters; and (2) it employs an additional loss function to guide parameter
selection toward globally optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate
that ARA achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the LLaMA2-7B model with a
80\% compression ratio, ARA reduces perplexity on WikiText2 from 8.38 to 6.42
and improves average zero-shot task accuracy by 9.72 percentage points compared
with uniform compression. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
method for rank allocation in SVD-based LLM compression.

Motivation: 现有去偏见方法在性能、静态修正策略及数据稀疏性方面存在问题，特别是在少数群体中。

Method: 提出FairNet框架进行动态实例级公正性修正。

Result: 理论分析表明FairNet在不降低总体模型性能的情况下，能够增强最差群体的表现，并可能略微提高性能。

Conclusion: FairNet在处理敏感属性标签完整、部分或完全缺失的场景时具有灵活性，其有效性通过多样的视觉和语言基准进行了全面实证评估。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in machine learning models is a critical challenge.
Existing debiasing methods often compromise performance, rely on static
correction strategies, and struggle with data sparsity, particularly within
minority groups. Furthermore, their utilization of sensitive attributes is
often suboptimal, either depending excessively on complete attribute labeling
or disregarding these attributes entirely. To overcome these limitations, we
propose FairNet, a novel framework for dynamic, instance-level fairness
correction. FairNet integrates a bias detector with conditional low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which enables selective activation of the fairness
correction mechanism exclusively for instances identified as biased, and
thereby preserve performance on unbiased instances. A key contribution is a new
contrastive loss function for training the LoRA module, specifically designed
to minimize intra-class representation disparities across different sensitive
groups and effectively address underfitting in minority groups. The FairNet
framework can flexibly handle scenarios with complete, partial, or entirely
absent sensitive attribute labels. Theoretical analysis confirms that, under
moderate TPR/FPR for the bias detector, FairNet can enhance the performance of
the worst group without diminishing overall model performance, and potentially
yield slight performance improvements. Comprehensive empirical evaluations
across diverse vision and language benchmarks validate the effectiveness of
FairNet.

Motivation: 针对大型语言模型在输出中可能复现敏感或有害内容的问题，新方法旨在解决现有反学习方法的缺陷。

Method: 提出了一种引导式框架 (BS)，来直接解决模型生成的高置信度内容对不良反应的影响。

Result: 通过实验验证，BS框架在更彻底地忘记不良内容的同时，保持模型的实用性，展现出与之前方法相比的有效性。

Conclusion: BS框架有效抑制了模型生成中不良响应的复现，同时保持了模型生成的有效性，证明了新的反学习方法的成功。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Conclusion: NVDPs 通过优化条件 dropout 后验，实现了对任务特定 dropout 率的稳健近似，能够应对多种功能模糊性和不确定性。

Abstract: Learning to infer the conditional posterior model is a key step for robust
meta-learning. This paper presents a new Bayesian meta-learning approach called
Neural Variational Dropout Processes (NVDPs). NVDPs model the conditional
posterior distribution based on a task-specific dropout; a low-rank product of
Bernoulli experts meta-model is utilized for a memory-efficient mapping of
dropout rates from a few observed contexts. It allows for a quick
reconfiguration of a globally learned and shared neural network for new tasks
in multi-task few-shot learning. In addition, NVDPs utilize a novel prior
conditioned on the whole task data to optimize the conditional \textit{dropout}
posterior in the amortized variational inference. Surprisingly, this enables
the robust approximation of task-specific dropout rates that can deal with a
wide range of functional ambiguities and uncertainties. We compared the
proposed method with other meta-learning approaches in the few-shot learning
tasks such as 1D stochastic regression, image inpainting, and classification.
The results show the excellent performance of NVDPs.

Result: 本文介绍了一种名为g-DPO的框架，旨在解决直接偏好优化（DPO）在对齐蛋白质语言模型与实验设计目标时的可扩展性瓶颈。g-DPO通过使用序列空间聚类来修剪冗余训练对，保持训练信号的同时，采用基于群体的近似法进行似然计算，从而加快收敛速度。在三个蛋白质工程任务中，g-DPO展示了与标准DPO在体内外性能上没有显著差异，但收敛速度提高了1.8到3.7倍，随着数据集规模的增加，预计将获得更大的收益。

Conclusion: g-DPO在提高训练效率的同时，保持了与传统DPO相当的性能，特别是在大数据集上有更显著的优势。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is an effective approach for aligning
protein language models with experimental design goals. However, DPO faces a
scalability bottleneck: the number of possible training pairs grows
quadratically with the number of labeled sequences, leading to prohibitive
training times even for modestly sized datasets. We introduce g-DPO, a
framework that (i) uses sequence space clustering to prune redundant pairs
while preserving training signal, and (ii) amortizes likelihood computations
with group-based approximations. Across three protein engineering tasks, g-DPO
maintains in-silico and in-vitro performance that is statistically
indistinguishable from standard DPO, while converging 1.8 to 3.7 times faster,
with greater gains expected as the size of the dataset increases.

Abstract: As AI systems approach dangerous capability levels where inability safety
cases become insufficient, we need alternative approaches to ensure safety.
This paper presents a roadmap for constructing safety cases based on
chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring in reasoning models and outlines our research
agenda. We argue that CoT monitoring might support both control and
trustworthiness safety cases. We propose a two-part safety case: (1)
establishing that models lack dangerous capabilities when operating without
their CoT, and (2) ensuring that any dangerous capabilities enabled by a CoT
are detectable by CoT monitoring. We systematically examine two threats to
monitorability: neuralese and encoded reasoning, which we categorize into three
forms (linguistic drift, steganography, and alien reasoning) and analyze their
potential drivers. We evaluate existing and novel techniques for maintaining
CoT faithfulness. For cases where models produce non-monitorable reasoning, we
explore the possibility of extracting a monitorable CoT from a non-monitorable
CoT. To assess the viability of CoT monitoring safety cases, we establish
prediction markets to aggregate forecasts on key technical milestones
influencing their feasibility.

Conclusion: INPO框架能够有效提升图模型在取消学习过程中的性能，达到了各项遗忘质量的最优指标，同时保持了模型的实用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph unlearning models have enhanced model utility by
preserving the node representation essentially invariant, while using gradient
ascent on the forget set to achieve unlearning. However, this approach causes a
drastic degradation in model utility during the unlearning process due to the
rapid divergence speed of gradient ascent. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{INPO}, an \textbf{I}nfluence-aware \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization framework that focuses on slowing the
divergence speed and improving the robustness of the model utility to the
unlearning process. Specifically, we first analyze that NPO has slower
divergence speed and theoretically propose that unlearning high-influence edges
can reduce impact of unlearning. We design an influence-aware message function
to amplify the influence of unlearned edges and mitigate the tight topological
coupling between the forget set and the retain set. The influence of each edge
is quickly estimated by a removal-based method. Additionally, we propose a
topological entropy loss from the perspective of topology to avoid excessive
information loss in the local structure during unlearning. Extensive
experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that INPO-based
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on all forget quality metrics while
maintaining the model's utility. Codes are available at

Result: HLQ在后期训练量化中使LLaMA3-8B在3位和2位精度下困惑度分别降低约8%和85%，并且2位LLaMA2-7B在Apple M2芯片上实现了超过25个tokens/s的推理效率。

Conclusion: ELUTQ与现有量化算法无关，可以无缝集成于各种量化流程，并在推理效率上取得显著提升。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on CPU-based edge devices is
crucial for enabling on-device intelligence and expanding AI accessibility.
However, it remains challenging due to limited memory and computational
resources. During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary
bottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory
consumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform
quantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high
dequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we
propose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel
quantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better
captures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the
computational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating
dequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms
and can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For
efficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for
end-to-end inference. Experiments show that for LLaMA3-8B, HLQ reduces
perplexity by about 8% at 3-bit and 85% at 2-bit precision under post-training
quantization, completing quantization within one hour. With efficient
finetuning, HLQ further improves 2-bit performance within two hours. In terms
of inference efficiency, our 2-bit LLaMA2-7B achieves over 25 tokens/s on an
Apple M2 chip (4 threads, batch size = 1).

Conclusion: SpikeQuant方法在准确性与能效方面表现优越，适合能量受限的边缘设备。

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), weight-activation quantization
helps fit models on edge device by reducing memory and compute bit-widths.
However, three challenges persist for energy constrained hardware: (1) even
after quantization, multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations remain unavoidable and
continue to dominate energy consumption; (2) dequantization (or
per-tensor/channel rescaling) introduces extra arithmetic and data movement,
increasing latency and energy; (3) uniform parameters bit widths clip salient
values-while intra-channel mixed precision is generally impractical on current
matrix hardware and memory. In contrast, brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), owing to their binary spike-based information representation and the
Integrate-and-Fire (IF) paradigm, naturally support mixed-precision storage and
energy-efficient computation by replacing complex MACs with temporal Accumulate
(ACCs). Motivated by this property, we propose SpikeQuant, which selectively
applies mixed-precision quantization to activations with salient values and
re-encodes them into binary spike counts, thereby enabling dynamic mixed
storage of different bitwidths. Furthermore, by embedding the quantization
scale into the threshold of the IF mechanism, our approach performs
energy-efficient linear transformations on weights and activations while
avoiding explicit dequantization. Experimental results demonstrate that
SpikeQuant consistently achieves near-FP16 perplexity under W4A4 quantization
while reducing energy cost by up to 4.6 times compared to existing methods,
highlighting its effectiveness for accurate and energy-efficient LLM
deployment.

Result: 本文探讨了一种新的方法，即联合一致性（consortium consistency），用于提高大语言模型（LLM）的幻觉检测和减轻能力。通过结合来自多个不同训练数据、训练方案和模型架构的LLM的响应，研究表明这种方法在幻觉检测和减轻效果上显著超过单一模型的一致性方法。此外，联合一致性方法还可以在性能提升的同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 联合一致性方法有效提升了多模型组合的幻觉检测和减轻能力，且具有降低推理成本的优势。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated state-of-the-art results in large language model
(LLM) hallucination detection and mitigation through consistency-based
approaches which involve aggregating multiple responses sampled from a single
LLM for a given prompt. These approaches help offset limitations stemming from
the imperfect data on which LLMs are trained, which includes biases and
under-representation of information required at deployment time among other
limitations which can lead to hallucinations. We show that extending these
single-model consistency methods to combine responses from multiple LLMs with
different training data, training schemes and model architectures can result in
substantial further improvements in hallucination detection and mitigation
capabilities beyond their single-model consistency counterparts. We evaluate
this \emph{consortium consistency} approach across many model teams from a pool
of 15 LLMs and explore under what conditions it is beneficial to team together
different LLMs in this manner. Further, we show that these performance
improvements often come with reduced inference costs, offsetting a significant
drawback with single-model consistency methods.

Motivation: 针对传统方法在预测与决策之间的失配以及观察数据中存在的多个偏差，提出了一种系统化的因果学习框架，以提升在线平台的市场营销决策效率。

Method: 开发了一个双层优化框架，利用实验数据估算操作研究的决策质量，并通过代替损失函数引导机器学习模型训练，同时通过隐式微分解决观察与实验数据的联合优化。

Result: 该论文介绍了一种新的双层决策聚焦因果学习方法（Bi-DFCL），旨在解决在线互联网平台在市场营销中的用户留存和收入优化问题。该方法通过结合实验和观察数据，提出了一个新的优化框架，解决了预测-决策不匹配和偏差-方差困境。实验结果表明，Bi-DFCL在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，并已在美团等大型在线平台上应用。

Conclusion: Bi-DFCL展示了在处理用户留存和优化决策中的潜在优势，结合了有效的实验与观察数据，取得了良好的实用效果。

Abstract: Online Internet platforms require sophisticated marketing strategies to
optimize user retention and platform revenue -- a classical resource allocation
problem. Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning
(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed
by operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm
presents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision
misalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy
without considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved
predictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the
bias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,
selection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized
controlled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --
resulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused
Causal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.
First, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using
experimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss
functions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a
bi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and
experimental data, solved via implicit differentiation. This novel formulation
enables our unbiased OR estimator to correct learning directions from biased
observational data, achieving optimal bias-variance tradeoff. Extensive
evaluations on public benchmarks, industrial marketing datasets, and
large-scale online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of Bi-DFCL, showing
statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art. Currently,
Bi-DFCL has been deployed at Meituan, one of the largest online food delivery
platforms in the world.

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准上的广泛实验验证了REBMBO的卓越性能和适应性。

Conclusion: REBMBO在优化复杂或高维任务时表现优越，克服了传统贝叶斯优化方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing Bayesian Optimization (BO) methods typically balance exploration and
exploitation to optimize costly objective functions. However, these methods
often suffer from a significant one-step bias, which may lead to convergence
towards local optima and poor performance in complex or high-dimensional tasks.
Recently, Black-Box Optimization (BBO) has achieved success across various
scientific and engineering domains, particularly when function evaluations are
costly and gradients are unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose the
Reinforced Energy-Based Model for Bayesian Optimization (REBMBO), which
integrates Gaussian Processes (GP) for local guidance with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) to capture global structural information. Notably, we define each
Bayesian Optimization iteration as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for adaptive multi-step lookahead,
dynamically adjusting the depth and direction of exploration to effectively
overcome the limitations of traditional BO methods. We conduct extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, confirming the superior
performance of REBMBO. Additional analyses across various GP configurations
further highlight its adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: MED-LQ在控制任务中显示出良好的应用潜力，尤其适合大规模马尔可夫决策过程。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of controlling linear systems with quadratic cost
under unknown dynamics with model-based reinforcement learning. Traditional
methods like Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty and Thompson Sampling, rooted
in multi-armed bandits (MABs), face practical limitations. In contrast, we
propose an alternative based on the Confusing Instance (CI) principle, which
underpins regret lower bounds in MABs and discrete Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs) and is central to the Minimum Empirical Divergence (MED) family of
algorithms, known for their asymptotic optimality in various settings. By
leveraging the structure of LQR policies along with sensitivity and stability
analysis, we develop MED-LQ. This novel control strategy extends the principles
of CI and MED beyond small-scale settings. Our benchmarks on a comprehensive
control suite demonstrate that MED-LQ achieves competitive performance in
various scenarios while highlighting its potential for broader applications in
large-scale MDPs.

Conclusion: 研究表明，融合领域知识的评估标准在理解分子数据的多样性上至关重要。

Abstract: AI methods are increasingly shaping pharmaceutical drug discovery. However,
their translation to industrial applications remains limited due to their
reliance on public datasets, lacking scale and diversity of proprietary
pharmaceutical data. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising approach to
integrate private data into privacy-preserving, collaborative model training
across data silos. This federated data access complicates important
data-centric tasks such as estimating dataset diversity, performing informed
data splits, and understanding the structure of the combined chemical space. To
address this gap, we investigate how well federated clustering methods can
disentangle and represent distributed molecular data. We benchmark three
approaches, Federated kMeans (Fed-kMeans), Federated Principal Component
Analysis combined with Fed-kMeans (Fed-PCA+Fed-kMeans), and Federated
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (Fed-LSH), against their centralized counterparts on
eight diverse molecular datasets. Our evaluation utilizes both, standard
mathematical and a chemistry-informed evaluation metrics, SF-ICF, that we
introduce in this work. The large-scale benchmarking combined with an in-depth
explainability analysis shows the importance of incorporating domain knowledge
through chemistry-informed metrics, and on-client explainability analyses for
federated diversity analysis on molecular data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统疏散模拟依赖于精细建模和大量参数，难以在早期设计阶段进行快速迭代，因此需要一种高效的疏散模拟方法。

Method: DiffEvac，基于生成模型的建筑疏散模式学习方法

Result: DiffEvac在SSIM上提高了37.6%，在PSNR上提高了142%，并且模拟速度快16倍，缩短至2分钟。

Conclusion: DiffEvac显著提高了设计迭代和调整过程的效率，为智能建筑设计中的安全优化提供了新思路和技术路径。

Abstract: Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.

Abstract: This paper argues that the method of least squares has significant
unfulfilled potential in modern machine learning, far beyond merely being a

generative models; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of Gaussian processes based
on predictive performance. By doing this, our work represents the next

Motivation: 现有的LoRA变体对学习的低秩子空间中的任务相关信息缺乏明确的区分机制，可能限制下游性能。

Method: 引入变分自编码器(VAE)来学习两个潜在空间，并通过新颖的证据下界(Evidence Lower Bound)公式促进潜在空间的因子分解。

Result: 在广泛实验中，FVAE-LoRA在多个任务上均超越了标准LoRA，并在评估虚假相关性中显示出更强的信号隔离能力，增强了模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FVAE-LoRA在处理文本、音频和图像任务上，相较于传统LoRA展现出更优越的性能，并在抗干扰能力上有所增强。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a widely used method for parameter-efficient
finetuning. However, existing LoRA variants lack mechanisms to explicitly
disambiguate task-relevant information within the learned low-rank subspace,
potentially limiting downstream performance. We propose Factorized Variational
Autoencoder LoRA (FVAE-LoRA), which leverages a VAE to learn two distinct
latent spaces. Our novel Evidence Lower Bound formulation explicitly promotes
factorization between the latent spaces, dedicating one latent space to
task-salient features and the other to residual information. Extensive
experiments on text, audio, and image tasks demonstrate that FVAE-LoRA
consistently outperforms standard LoRA. Moreover, spurious correlation
evaluations confirm that FVAE-LoRA better isolates task-relevant signals,
leading to improved robustness under distribution shifts. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 本研究提出了WO元学习器以解决时间变化设置中异质性处理效应估计的挑战，显著提高了估计的稳定性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着治疗序列和观察数据的不平衡性增加，现有的元学习方法难以满足对异质性处理效应的有效估计，因此需要一种新的方法来改善这些估计的可靠性。

Method: 开发了一种新的Neyman正交群体风险函数，以最小化重叠加权Oracle风险，并证明了其在处理干扰函数错误设定方面的稳健性。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的重叠加权正交（WO）元学习器，用于估计时间变化环境中的异质性处理效应（HTEs）。面对治疗序列观察概率随着预测时间增加而急剧下降的问题，现有的元学习器通常假设治疗重叠足够，从而在重叠度低时易导致高估计方差。WO元学习器通过关注观察数据中获得干预治疗序列的高概率区域，提出了一种数据驱动的方法来应对现有元学习器的稳定性问题，并获得更可靠的HTE估计。本研究发展了一种新的Neyman正交群体风险函数，旨在最小化重叠加权的Oracle风险，并展示了WO学习器在对抗干扰函数的错误设定方面表现出Neyman正交性。此外，WO学习器具有完全模型不可知性，可应用于任何机器学习模型。通过使用transformer和LSTM骨干进行的广泛实验，表明了我们新方法的优势。

Conclusion: 我们的WO元学习器通过聚焦在高概率治疗序列的观察数据上，克服了重叠问题及估计不稳定性，显示出优越的HTE估计能力。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) in time-varying settings is
particularly challenging, as the probability of observing certain treatment
sequences decreases exponentially with longer prediction horizons. Thus, the
observed data contain little support for many plausible treatment sequences,
which creates severe overlap problems. Existing meta-learners for the
time-varying setting typically assume adequate treatment overlap, and thus
suffer from exploding estimation variance when the overlap is low. To address
this problem, we introduce a novel overlap-weighted orthogonal (WO)
meta-learner for estimating HTEs that targets regions in the observed data with
high probability of receiving the interventional treatment sequences. This
offers a fully data-driven approach through which our WO-learner can counteract
instabilities as in existing meta-learners and thus obtain more reliable HTE
estimates. Methodologically, we develop a novel Neyman-orthogonal population
risk function that minimizes the overlap-weighted oracle risk. We show that our
WO-learner has the favorable property of Neyman-orthogonality, meaning that it
is robust against misspecification in the nuisance functions. Further, our
WO-learner is fully model-agnostic and can be applied to any machine learning
model. Through extensive experiments with both transformer and LSTM backbones,
we demonstrate the benefits of our novel WO-learner.

Result: 本文研究了在个性化医疗和广告等领域的政策学习算法，尤其是在不确定情况下如何进行安全决策。我们提出了一种两阶段的学习者，先识别近似最优的政策，再建设弃权规则以处理政策之间的分歧。研究结果表明，当已知倾向性时，拥有快速的O(1/n)类型的遗憾保证，并且这项保证可以通过双重稳健（DR）目标扩展到未知倾向性。弃权策略被证明是政策学习的一个多用途工具，能够提高在边际条件下的保证，连接到分布稳健政策学习，并支持安全的政策改进。

Conclusion: 弃权作为一种灵活的工具，不仅改进了政策学习中的保证条件，还可应用于多个核心问题，实现安全的政策改进。

Abstract: Policy learning algorithms are widely used in areas such as personalized
medicine and advertising to develop individualized treatment regimes. However,
most methods force a decision even when predictions are uncertain, which is
risky in high-stakes settings. We study policy learning with abstention, where
a policy may defer to a safe default or an expert. When a policy abstains, it
receives a small additive reward on top of the value of a random guess. We
propose a two-stage learner that first identifies a set of near-optimal
policies and then constructs an abstention rule from their disagreements. We
establish fast O(1/n)-type regret guarantees when propensities are known, and
extend these guarantees to the unknown-propensity case via a doubly robust (DR)
objective. We further show that abstention is a versatile tool with direct
applications to other core problems in policy learning: it yields improved
guarantees under margin conditions without the common realizability assumption,
connects to distributionally robust policy learning by hedging against small
data shifts, and supports safe policy improvement by ensuring improvement over
a baseline policy with high probability.

Result: 通过引入层次化的投机解码算法，显著提高生成速度，减少推理延迟。

Conclusion: HSD能通过优化模型选择，实现在生成延迟上的显著提升，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Transformer language models generate text autoregressively, making inference
latency proportional to the number of tokens generated. Speculative decoding
reduces this latency without sacrificing output quality, by leveraging a small
draft model to propose tokens that the larger target model verifies in
parallel. In practice, however, there may exist a set of potential draft
models- ranging from faster but less inaccurate, to slower yet more reliable.
We introduce Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), an algorithm that stacks
these draft models into a hierarchy, where each model proposes tokens, and the
next larger model verifies them in a single forward pass, until finally the
target model verifies tokens. We derive an expression for the expected latency
of any such hierarchy and show that selecting the latency-optimal hierarchy can
be done in polynomial time. Empirically, HSD gives up to 1.2x speed-up over the
best single-draft baseline, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm in
reducing generation latency beyond previous techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型预训练时间序列模型在资源有限的环境中部署受到挑战，因此需要一种轻量级的基础模型来解决这一问题。

Method: SEMPO包含两个关键模块：能量感知谱分解模块和基于混合提示的Transformer，分别提高了预训练数据的利用效率和模型适应性的参数效率。

Result: 提出了一种名为SEMPO的轻量级基础模型，能够在相对小规模的数据上进行预训练，并实现强大的时间序列预测能力。

Conclusion: SEMPO在零-shot和少-shot预测场景下相较于最先进的方法展现了卓越的性能，具备较好的泛化能力。

Abstract: The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available

not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.

TL;DR: 本研究提供了一种高效的在线SGD方法，能在高维设置下有效地构建置信区间，避免了传统方法的计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险应用中需要严格量化SGD的固有不确定性，以确保其可靠性和有效性。

Method: 建立了针对在线最小二乘SGD的非渐近Berry-Esseen界限，提供高维情况下的Gaussian中心极限定理。

Result: 在迭代次数t大于等于d的1加上任意正数的情况下，SGD的CLT成立，支持了高维推断的更广泛应用。

Conclusion: 提出了一种在线的、数据驱动的方法来构建SGD迭代的置信区间，能够在近乎最优的比例下执行。

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone method in modern
data science. However, deploying SGD in high-stakes applications necessitates
rigorous quantification of its inherent uncertainty. In this work, we establish
\emph{non-asymptotic Berry--Esseen bounds} for linear functionals of online
least-squares SGD, thereby providing a Gaussian Central Limit Theorem (CLT) in
a \emph{growing-dimensional regime}. Existing approaches to high-dimensional
inference for projection parameters, such as~\cite{chang2023inference}, rely on
inverting empirical covariance matrices and require at least $t \gtrsim
d^{3/2}$ iterations to achieve finite-sample Berry--Esseen guarantees,
rendering them computationally expensive and restrictive in the allowable
dimensional scaling. In contrast, we show that a CLT holds for SGD iterates
when the number of iterations grows as $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$ for any $\delta
> 0$, significantly extending the dimensional regime permitted by prior works
while improving computational efficiency. The proposed online SGD-based
procedure operates in $\mathcal{O}(td)$ time and requires only $\mathcal{O}(d)$
memory, in contrast to the $\mathcal{O}(td^2 + d^3)$ runtime of
covariance-inversion methods. To render the theory practically applicable, we
further develop an \emph{online variance estimator} for the asymptotic variance
appearing in the CLT and establish \emph{high-probability deviation bounds} for
this estimator. Collectively, these results yield the first fully online and
data-driven framework for constructing confidence intervals for SGD iterates in
the near-optimal scaling regime $t \gtrsim d^{1+\delta}$.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯深度学习方法可以显著提高物种分布模型在数据稀缺区域的可靠性，从而推动生态理解和保护工作。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence
based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to
biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to
perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness
remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep
SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical
framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited
observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with
broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty
quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science
observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian
deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in
data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and
conservation efforts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Transformers在学习通用算法时的不足，特别是依赖脆弱的启发式方法。通过图连接性进行实验和理论分析，证明了一个简化的Transformer架构在特定容量内能够实现精确的算法，而超出该容量则只学习简单启发式。

Result: 研究证明，模型的学习效果与训练实例是否在其容量范围内密切相关，影响最终学习的策略。

Conclusion: 通过限制训练数据在模型容量范围内，可以让Transformer学习精确的算法而非启发式方法。

Abstract: Transformers often fail to learn generalizable algorithms, instead relying on
brittle heuristics. Using graph connectivity as a testbed, we explain this
phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. We consider a simplified
Transformer architecture, the disentangled Transformer, and prove that an
$L$-layer model has capacity to solve for graphs with diameters up to exactly
$3^L$, implementing an algorithm equivalent to computing powers of the
adjacency matrix. We analyze the training-dynamics, and show that the learned
strategy hinges on whether most training instances are within this model
capacity. Within-capacity graphs (diameter $\leq 3^L$) drive the learning of a
correct algorithmic solution while beyond-capacity graphs drive the learning of
a simple heuristic based on node degrees. Finally, we empirically demonstrate
that restricting training data within a model's capacity leads to both standard
and disentangled transformers learning the exact algorithm rather than the
degree-based heuristic.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CONFEX的方法，能够生成兼顾不确定性的反事实解释，确保其可靠性和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实解释在模型预测中的重要性在于能提供可理解的理由，然而现有方法在处理不确定性上存在局限，因此本文旨在提出一种有效、可靠的解决方案。

Method: 通过结合保形预测和混合整数线性规划，开发了一个局部化的CP程序，确保生成的反事实解释具备局部覆盖保证。

Result: 提出了一种新的方法CONFEX，用于生成考虑不确定性的反事实解释。该方法结合了保形预测和混合整数线性规划，确保生成的解释在不确定性和最优性上都有严格的保证，并使用离线树形分区高效地对输入空间进行编码。通过在多个基准和指标上进行评估，与现有的最先进方法相比，CONFEX在提供稳健且合理的解释方面显示出了优越性。

Conclusion: CONFEX方法提供了对模型预测的不确定性和最优性有严格保证的反事实解释，是一种可靠的可解释性工具。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFXs) provide human-understandable
justifications for model predictions, enabling actionable recourse and
enhancing interpretability. To be reliable, CFXs must avoid regions of high
predictive uncertainty, where explanations may be misleading or inapplicable.
However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty or lack principled
mechanisms for incorporating it with formal guarantees. We propose CONFEX, a
novel method for generating uncertainty-aware counterfactual explanations using
Conformal Prediction (CP) and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). CONFEX
explanations are designed to provide local coverage guarantees, addressing the
issue that CFX generation violates exchangeability. To do so, we develop a
novel localised CP procedure that enjoys an efficient MILP encoding by
leveraging an offline tree-based partitioning of the input space. This way,
CONFEX generates CFXs with rigorous guarantees on both predictive uncertainty
and optimality. We evaluate CONFEX against state-of-the-art methods across
diverse benchmarks and metrics, demonstrating that our uncertainty-aware
approach yields robust and plausible explanations.

Motivation: 当前的会员推断攻击（MIA）虽然是评估AI模型隐私风险的标准工具，但现有的高级攻击方法需要训练多个参考模型，限制了其实用性。

Method: 利用高损失区域缺失离群点作为风险预测因子，结合简单损失攻击的TNR，评估模型在MIAs下的脆弱性。

Result: 提出了一种新的方法，通过仅使用训练和测试分布来评估模型级别的脆弱性，且无需参考模型。

Conclusion: 通过多种架构和数据集的评估，所提方法能够有效估计模型在MIA攻击下的脆弱性，且优于低成本攻击和其他分布差异度量。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for
evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks
require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models,
limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating
model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks
without requiring reference models. Empirical analysis shows loss distributions
to be asymmetric and heavy-tailed and suggests that most points at risk from
MIAs have moved from the tail (high-loss region) to the head (low-loss region)
of the distribution after training. We leverage this insight to propose a
method to estimate model-level vulnerability from the training and testing
distribution alone: using the absence of outliers from the high-loss region as
a predictor of the risk. We evaluate our method, the TNR of a simple loss
attack, across a wide range of architectures and datasets and show it to
accurately estimate model-level vulnerability to the SOTA MIA attack (LiRA). We
also show our method to outperform both low-cost (few reference models) attacks
such as RMIA and other measures of distribution difference. We finally evaluate
the use of non-linear functions to evaluate risk and show the approach to be
promising to evaluate the risk in large-language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a new sparse fine-tuning method focused on selecting parameters with high task relevance but low pre-trained values, enhancing model adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse fine-tuning techniques need to optimally select parameters to adapt LLMs for specific tasks.

Method: GaLLoP fine-tunes model parameters based on their gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and their pre-trained magnitudes.

Result: GaLLoP consistently improves or matches performance against other leading fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: GaLLoP reduces catastrophic forgetting and ensures stable performance, providing robust generalization across various conditions.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Motivation: 解决Alice如何证明Bob使用她的语言模型的问题，特别是通过数据的记忆特性进行探讨。

Method: 提出假设检验问题，探讨如何通过查询或观察检测Bob模型是否使用Alice的模型。

Result: 通过在不同的设置下，使用统计方法分析了Bob的模型或文本与Alice训练数据顺序之间的相关性，得到了显著的p值。

Conclusion: Alice可以通过查询或观察Bob的模型和文本的表现，基于统计证据来判断是否依赖于她的模型，且两种方法在有效性上各有特点。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

Conclusion: 经过充分训练后，转换器在新任务中只需少量示例即可实现良好的泛化，展现出强大的元学习能力。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities, raising the question of whether they can serve as metalearners
that adapt to new tasks using only a small number of in-context examples,
without any further training. While recent theoretical work has studied
transformers' ability to perform ICL, most of these analyses do not address the
formal metalearning setting, where the objective is to solve a collection of
related tasks more efficiently than would be possible by solving each task
individually. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical analysis showing
that a simplified transformer architecture trained via gradient descent can act
as a near-optimal metalearner in a linear classification setting. We consider a
natural family of tasks where each task corresponds to a class-conditional
Gaussian mixture model, with the mean vectors lying in a shared $k$-dimensional
subspace of $R^d$. After training on a sufficient number of such tasks, we show
that the transformer can generalize to a new task using only $O(k / R^4)$
in-context examples, where $R$ denotes the signal strength at test time. This
performance (almost) matches that of an optimal learner that knows exactly the
shared subspace and significantly outperforms any learner that only has access
to the in-context data, which requires $\Omega(d / R^4)$ examples to
generalize. Importantly, our bounds on the number of training tasks and
examples per task needed to achieve this result are independent of the ambient
dimension $d$.

Conclusion: 研究强调中等收入国家应采取情境敏感的策略，建立可持续和战略性足够的人工智能能力。

Abstract: The rapid escalation of computational requirements for training large-scale
language models has reinforced structural asymmetries between high-capacity
jurisdictions and countries in the Global South. This paper examines the
technical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in
Brazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy
availability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies
accelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150
days), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,
and regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model. Our
findings show that while all configurations remain below export-control and
electrical infrastructure thresholds, fiscal viability is determined by
hardware efficiency. H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a
total cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million
USD due to higher energy and hardware demand. We argue that extending training
timelines should be treated as a policy lever to mitigate hardware constraints,
enabling the production of usable, auditable, and locally aligned models
without competing at the global frontier. This study contributes to the
discourse on AI compute governance and technological sovereignty by
highlighting context-sensitive strategies that allow middle-income countries to
establish sustainable and strategically sufficient AI capabilities.

Conclusion: 将世界建模视为语义信息的预测，可以有效提升机器人在复杂任务中的规划能力，并克服传统模型的局限。

Abstract: Planning with world models offers a powerful paradigm for robotic control.
Conventional approaches train a model to predict future frames conditioned on
current frames and actions, which can then be used for planning. However, the
objective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning
objective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good
planning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future
frames as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic
information about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world
modeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in
future frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the
same tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can
be trained as "semantic" world models through a supervised finetuning process
on image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while
inheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the
pretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic
world model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,
leading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of
reconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling. Website available at

Method: 提出了一种步骤感知的残差引导扩散模型，通过从低密度输入中学习动态残差条件，指导去噪过程以实现高密度重建。

Result: 通过在SEED、SEED-IV和Localize-MI数据集上全面评估，SRGDiff有效减小低高密度记录之间的空间谱偏移，提高了信号、特征及下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: SRGDiff在EEG空间超分辨率任务中表现优越，相较于强基线模型，其性能提升可达40%。

Abstract: For real-world BCI applications, lightweight Electroencephalography (EEG)
systems offer the best cost-deployment balance. However, such spatial sparsity
of EEG limits spatial fidelity, hurting learning and introducing bias. EEG
spatial super-resolution methods aim to recover high-density EEG signals from
sparse measurements, yet is often hindered by distribution shift and signal
distortion and thus reducing fidelity and usability for EEG analysis and
visualization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SRGDiff, a step-aware
residual-guided diffusion model that formulates EEG spatial super-resolution as
dynamic conditional generation. Our key idea is to learn a dynamic residual
condition from the low-density input that predicts the step-wise temporal and
spatial details to add and uses the evolving cue to steer the denoising process
toward high-density reconstructions. At each denoising step, the proposed
residual condition is additively fused with the previous denoiser feature maps,
then a step-dependent affine modulation scales and shifts the activation to
produce the current features. This iterative procedure dynamically extracts
step-wise temporal rhythms and spatial-topographic cues to steer high-density
recovery and maintain a fidelity-consistency balance. We adopt a comprehensive
evaluation protocol spanning signal-, feature-, and downstream-level metrics
across SEED, SEED-IV, and Localize-MI and multiple upsampling scales. SRGDiff
achieves consistent gains of up to 40% over strong baselines, proving its
superiority in the task of EEG spatial super-resolution. Moreover, topographic
visualizations comparison and substantial EEG-FID gains jointly indicate that
our SR EEG mitigates the spatial-spectral shift between low- and high-density
recordings.

Conclusion: CDI-DTI提供了一种有效且可解释的工具，适用于药物-靶标相互作用预测，尤其在跨领域和冷启动任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal for drug
discovery, yet existing methods often fail to address challenges like
cross-domain generalization, cold-start prediction, and interpretability. In
this work, we propose CDI-DTI, a novel cross-domain interpretable framework for
DTI prediction, designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating
multi-modal features-textual, structural, and functional-through a
multi-strategy fusion approach, CDI-DTI ensures robust performance across
different domains and in cold-start scenarios. A multi-source cross-attention
mechanism is introduced to align and fuse features early, while a bidirectional
cross-attention layer captures fine-grained intra-modal drug-target
interactions. To enhance model interpretability, we incorporate Gram Loss for
feature alignment and a deep orthogonal fusion module to eliminate redundancy.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDI-DTI
significantly outperforms existing methods, particularly in cross-domain and
cold-start tasks, while maintaining high interpretability for practical
applications in drug-target interaction prediction.
