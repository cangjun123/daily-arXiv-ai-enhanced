As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4fdd\u969c\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u7b26\u5408\u6307\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5feb\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u7740\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead.

Each pull of an arm provides reward that increases monotonically with diminishing returns. A growing line of work has designed algorithms for improving bandits, albeit with somewhat pessimistic worst-case guarantees. Indeed, strong lower bounds of $\u03a9(k)$ and $\u03a9(\\sqrt{k})$ multiplicative approximation factors are known for both deterministic and randomized algorithms (respectively) relative to the optimal arm, where $k$ is the number of bandit arms. In this work, we propose two new parameterized families of bandit algorithms and bound the sample complexity of learning the near-optimal algorithm from each family using offline data. The first family we define includes the optimal randomized algorithm from prior work. We show that an appropriately chosen algorithm from this family can achieve stronger guarantees, with optimal dependence on $k$, when the arm reward curves satisfy additional properties related to the strength of concavity. Our second family contains algorithms that both guarantee best-arm identification on well-behaved instances and revert to worst case guarantees on poorly-behaved instances.

LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder.

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837(SCS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "The study aims to tackle the problem of rewarding flawed reasoning pathways in reinforcement learning, which can mislead model training and reduce overall performance.", "method": "SCS addresses unfaithful trajectories in reinforcement learning by introducing visual perturbations and performing repeated truncation and resampling of initial trajectories to derive a consistency score.", "result": "Implementation of SCS improved accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible additional computation, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing model reliability.", "conclusion": "Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) significantly enhances the reliability of outcome-reward reinforcement learning in multimodal large language models, achieving improved accuracy across multiple benchmarks with minimal computational cost."}}
