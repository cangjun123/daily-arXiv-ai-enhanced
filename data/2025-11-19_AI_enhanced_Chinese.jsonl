This skill is important for preparing forms (e.g., insurance claims) or other legal documents (e.g., court claims), but often presents a challenge for laypeople. Current AI approaches aim to bridge this gap, but mostly rely on the user to articulate what has happened in text, which may be challenging for many. Here, we investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and summarize events occurring in videos. We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains.

Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.\n  TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.\n  Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations.

To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction.

However, spatial reasoning:a fundamental component of human cognition that includes mental rotation, navigation, and spatial relationship comprehension remains a significant challenge for current advanced VLMs. We hypothesize that imagination, the internal simulation of spatial states, is the dominant reasoning mechanism within a spatial world model. To test this hypothesis and systematically probe current VLM spatial reasoning mechanisms, we introduce SpatiaLite, a fully synthetic benchmark that jointly measures spatial reasoning accuracy and reasoning efficiency. Comprehensive experiments reveal three key findings. First, advanced VLMs predominantly rely on linguistic representations for reasoning and imagination, resulting in significant deficiencies on visual centric tasks that demand perceptual spatial relations and 3D geometry transformations such as mental rotation or projection prediction. Second, advanced VLMs exhibit severe inefficiency in their current spatial reasoning mechanisms, with token usage growing rapidly as transformation complexity increases. Third, we propose an Imagery Driven Framework (IDF) for data synthesis and training, which can implicitly construct an internal world model that is critical for spatial reasoning in VLMs. Building on SpatiaLite, this work delineates the spatial reasoning limits and patterns of advanced VLMs, identifies key shortcomings, and informs future advances", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5f71\u50cf\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165SpatiaLite\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7VLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f71\u50cf\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\\to$ another language $\\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts.

State-of-the-art (SOTA) TRL methods transform raw GPS trajectories to grid or road trajectories to capture high-level travel semantics, i.e., regions and roads. However, they lose fine-grained spatial-temporal details as multiple GPS points are grouped into a single grid cell or road segment. To tackle this problem, we propose the BLUrred Encoding method, dubbed BLUE, which gradually reduces the precision of GPS coordinates to create hierarchical patches with multiple levels. The low-level patches are small and preserve fine-grained spatial-temporal details, while the high-level patches are large and capture overall travel patterns. To complement different patch levels with each other, our BLUE is an encoder-decoder model with a pyramid structure. At each patch level, a Transformer is used to learn the trajectory embedding at the current level, while pooling prepares inputs for the higher level in the encoder, and up-resolution provides guidance for the lower level in the decoder. BLUE is trained using the trajectory reconstruction task with the MSE loss. We compare BLUE with 8 SOTA TRL methods for 3 downstream tasks, the results show that BLUE consistently achieves higher accuracy than all baselines, outperforming the best-performing baselines by an average of 30.90%.

However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance.

This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals.

Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions.

Existing methods for analyzing these biases in diffusion models either focus narrowly on predefined categories or depend on manual interpretation of latent directions. These constraints limit scalability and hinder the discovery of subtle or unanticipated patterns.\n  We introduce SCALEX, a framework for scalable and automated exploration of diffusion model latent spaces. SCALEX extracts semantically meaningful directions from H-space using only natural language prompts, enabling zero-shot interpretation without retraining or labelling.

While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

They assumed that the SCMs were learned from purely observational data, leading to an imprecise characterization of the marginal distributions of exogenous variables. Their method leveraged the canonical representation of structural equations to decompose a general SCM with high-cardinality exogenous variables into a set of sub-models with low-cardinality exogenous variables. These sub-models had precise marginals over the exogenous variables and therefore admitted efficient exact inference. The aggregated results were used to bound counterfactual probabilities in the original model. The approach was developed for Markovian models, where each exogenous variable affects only a single endogenous variable. In this paper, we investigate extending the methodology to \\textit{semi-Markovian} SCMs, where exogenous variables may influence multiple endogenous variables. Such models are capable of representing confounding relationships that Markovian models cannot. We illustrate the challenges of this extension using a minimal example, which motivates a set of alternative solution strategies.

To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods.

Schloss"], "title": "Affective Color Scales for Colormap Data Visualizations", "comment": "To be published in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics", "summary": "Research on affective visualization design has shown that color is an especially powerful feature for influencing the emotional connotation of visualizations. Associations between colors and emotions are largely driven by lightness (e.g., lighter colors are associated with positive emotions, whereas darker colors are associated with negative emotions). Designing visualizations to have all light or all dark colors to convey particular emotions may work well for visualizations in which colors represent categories and spatial channels encode data values. However, this approach poses a problem for visualizations that use color to represent spatial patterns in data (e.g., colormap data visualizations) because lightness contrast is needed to reveal fine details in spatial structure. In this study, we found it is possible to design colormaps that have strong lightness contrast to support spatial vision while communicating clear affective connotation. We also found that affective connotation depended not only on the color scales used to construct the colormaps, but also the frequency with which colors appeared in the map, as determined by the underlying dataset (data-dependence hypothesis). These results emphasize the importance of data-aware design, which accounts for not only the design features that encode data (e.g., colors, shapes, textures), but also how those design features are instantiated in a visualization, given the properties of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1 colormaps\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f20\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u6db5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u989c\u8272\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u8fd0\u7528\u989c\u8272\u6765\u4f20\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1 colormaps\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u989c\u8272\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u9891\u7387\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684 colormaps\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u4f20\u8fbe\u660e\u786e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u6db5\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u6db5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8272\u5f69\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8fd8\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9700\u8003\u8651\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9053\u8def\u6bb5\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u5730\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u6545\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08Mapfusion\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Mapfusion\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9053\u8def\u6bb5\u6f14\u5316\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u771f\u5b9e\u4e8b\u6545\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs can accurately predict vehicle trajectories and lane-change intentions by gathering and transforming data from surrounding vehicles. However, the robustness of such LLM-based prediction models for safety-critical driving systems remains unexplored, despite the increasing concerns about the trustworthiness of LLMs. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic vulnerability analysis of LLM-enabled vehicle trajectory prediction. We propose a one-feature differential evolution attack that perturbs a single kinematic feature of surrounding vehicles within the LLM's input prompts under a black-box setting. Experiments on the highD dataset reveal that even minor, physically plausible perturbations can significantly disrupt model outputs, underscoring the susceptibility of LLM-based predictors to adversarial manipulation. Further analyses reveal a trade-off between accuracy and robustness, examine the failure mechanism, and explore potential mitigation solutions. The findings provide the very first insights into adversarial vulnerabilities of LLM-driven automated vehicle models in the context of vehicular interactions and highlight the need for robustness-oriented design in future LLM-based intelligent transportation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5bf9\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u8fd1\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u8bc1\u660e\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u8fdb\u5316\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u5468\u56f4\u8f66\u8f86\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f7b\u5fae\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5e94\u6ce8\u91cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features.

Pattern-matching systems can encounter issues where exponential time and space are required to find matches for rules with many underconstrained variables, or which produce combinatorial intermediate partial matches (but are otherwise well-constrained). When online AI systems automatically generate rules from example-driven induction or code synthesis, they can easily produce worst-case matching patterns that slow or halt program execution by exceeding available memory. In our own work with cognitive systems that learn from example, we've found that aggressive forms of anti-unification-based generalization can easily produce these circumstances. To make these systems practical without hand-engineering constraints or succumbing to unpredictable failure modes, we introduce a new matching algorithm called CORGI (Collection-Oriented Relational Graph Iteration). Unlike RETE-based approaches, CORGI offers quadratic time and space guarantees for finding single satisficing matches, and the ability to iteratively stream subsequent matches without committing entire conflict sets to memory. CORGI differs from RETE in that it does not have a traditional $\u03b2$-memory for collecting partial matches. Instead, CORGI takes a two-step approach: a graph of grounded relations is built/maintained in a forward pass, and an iterator generates matches as needed by working backward through the graph. This approach eliminates the high-latency delays and memory overflows that can result from populating full conflict sets. In a performance evaluation, we demonstrate that CORGI significantly outperforms RETE implementations from SOAR and OPS5 on a simple combinatorial matching task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5728\u7ebfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCORGI\u7684\u65b0\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u524d\u5411\u6784\u5efa\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5e76\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6ea2\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "CORGI\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86SOAR\u548cOPS5\u7684RETE\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "CORGI\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eRETE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

The results revealed slight increases in negative affect and anxiety levels during the sneeze simulation. Also, a reduction in positive affect was revealed.

During joint multimodal training, due to modality bias, the advantaged modality often dominates backpropagation, leading to imbalanced optimization. Existing methods still face two problems: First, the long-term dominance of the dominant modality weakens representation-output coupling in the late stages of training, resulting in the accumulation of redundant information. Second, previous methods often directly and uniformly adjust the gradients of the advantaged modality, ignoring the semantics and directionality between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Redundancy Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Refinement (RedReg), which is inspired by information bottleneck principle. Specifically, we construct a redundancy phase monitor that uses a joint criterion of effective gain growth rate and redundancy to trigger intervention only when redundancy is high. Furthermore, we design a co-information gating mechanism to estimate the contribution of the current dominant modality based on cross-modal semantics. When the task primarily relies on a single modality, the suppression term is automatically disabled to preserve modality-specific information. Finally, we project the gradient of the dominant modality onto the orthogonal complement of the joint multimodal gradient subspace and suppress the gradient according to redundancy. Experiments show that our method demonstrates superiority among current major methods in most scenarios. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of our method.

This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u811a\u672c\u3001\u5168\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u75f4\u5446\u7684\u7b5b\u67e5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7a33\u5b9a\u9762\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c06\u5fae\u5c0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u77ed\u7a97\u53e3\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u5728YT DemTalk\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u75f4\u5446\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0cAUROC\u8fbe\u52300.953\uff0cAP\u4e3a0.961\uff0cF1-score\u4e3a0.851\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a0.857\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u5fae\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u88ab\u52a8\u75f4\u5446\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba4\u77e5\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u8a00\u6216\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5f3a\u3002"}}

To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced.

However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning.

While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) has made inroads in \"Thanatechnology,\" current research often focuses on practical aspects like digital legacy management, overlooking the subjective, existential needs of those facing death in isolation. To address this gap, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 14 lonely, terminally ill individuals. Our core contributions are: (1) An empirically-grounded model articulating the complex psychological, practical, social, and spiritual needs of this group; (2) The \"Three Pillars, Twelve Principles\" framework for designing IUIs as \"Existential Companions\"; and (3) A critical design directive derived from user evaluations: technology in this context should aim for transcendence over simulation. The findings suggest that IUIs should create experiences that augment or surpass human capabilities, rather than attempting to simulate basic human connections, which can paradoxically deepen loneliness.

Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners.

Rather than adopting a qualitative or empirical approach, the paper develops a conceptual integration of insights from HRM, human-computer interaction (HCI), and Science and Technology Studies. The analysis highlights that although algorithmic systems can enhance operational efficiency, they risk reinforcing biases and narrowing the relational and contextual dimensions of work. These systems often overlook intangible contributions such as creativity, empathy, and collaborative problem solving, revealing gaps in data-driven performance measurement. In response, the study proposes a sociotechnical perspective on algorithmic accountability that emphasizes procedural transparency, organizational justice, and employee agency. By revisiting foundational questions within the rapidly evolving landscape of algorithmic management, the paper contributes to ongoing debates about the future of work and the design of managerial technologies that support, rather than constrain, human autonomy and organizational life.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u6ce8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u8d23\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u7a0b\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u7ee9\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u6574\u5408HRM\u3001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HCI\uff09\u548c\u79d1\u6280\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u6216\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u5ffd\u89c6\u521b\u9020\u529b\u3001\u540c\u60c5\u5fc3\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b49\u65e0\u5f62\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7ee9\u6548\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u95ee\u8d23\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a0b\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u516c\u6b63\u548c\u5458\u5de5\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, these models often produce chemically invalid molecules, which limits the usable scope of the learned chemical space and poses significant challenges for practical applications. To address this issue, we propose ChemFixer, a framework designed to correct invalid molecules into valid ones. ChemFixer is built on a transformer architecture, pre-trained using masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a large-scale dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs that we constructed. Through comprehensive evaluations across diverse generative models, ChemFixer improved molecular validity while effectively preserving the chemical and biological distributional properties of the original outputs. This indicates that ChemFixer can recover molecules that could not be previously generated, thereby expanding the diversity of potential drug candidates. Furthermore, ChemFixer was effectively applied to a drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction task using limited data, improving the validity of generated ligands and discovering promising ligand-protein pairs. These results suggest that ChemFixer is not only effective in data-limited scenarios, but also extensible to a wide range of downstream tasks. Taken together, ChemFixer shows promise as a practical tool for various stages of deep learning-based drug discovery, enhancing molecular validity and expanding accessible chemical space.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemFixer corrects invalid molecules generated by deep learning, enhancing validity and diversity for drug discovery.", "motivation": "The need to address the generation of chemically invalid molecules by deep learning models to improve the practical applications in drug discovery.", "method": "ChemFixer utilizes a transformer architecture, pre-trained with masking techniques, and fine-tuned on a dataset of valid/invalid molecular pairs.", "result": "ChemFixer improved molecular validity and preserved chemical properties, facilitated effective DTI prediction with limited data, and showed potential across various downstream tasks.", "conclusion": "ChemFixer is an effective framework for correcting invalid molecules, enhancing molecular validity, and expanding accessible chemical space for drug discovery."}}

Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources.

While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable.

Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes.

However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance.

Although various external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) have been developed to facilitate interactions, psychological factors, such as a lack of trust and inadequate emotional signaling, may still deter users from confidently engaging with AVs in certain contexts. To address this gap, we propose TailCue, an exploration of how tail-based eHMIs affect user interaction with AVs. We first investigated mappings between tail movements and emotional expressions from robotics and zoology, and accordingly developed a motion-emotion mapping scheme. A physical robotic tail was implemented, and specific tail motions were designed based on our scheme. An online, video-based user study with 21 participants was conducted. Our findings suggest that, although the intended emotions conveyed by the tail were not consistently recognized, open-ended feedback indicated that the tail motion needs to align with the scenarios and cues.

However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting.

Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion.

This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u56de\u8def\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u65f6\u673a\u4e0d\u5bf9\u6216\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5fae\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u914d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u5148\u51b3\u6761\u4ef6\u53ca\u53cd\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8d2a\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u653e\u677e\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u8bfe\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u6559\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ed\u73af\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5173\u6ce8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002"}}

KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the \"fill-in-the-blank\" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure.

In contrast, tokens, which play essential roles in many research fields, exhibit similar characteristics of growth, yet investigations into their incremental learning remain significantly scarce. This research gap primarily stems from the holistic nature of tokens in language, which imposes significant challenges on the design of incremental learning frameworks for them. To overcome this obstacle, in this work, we turn to a type of token, gene, for a large-scale biological dataset--single-cell transcriptomics--to formulate a pipeline for gene incremental learning and establish corresponding evaluations.

Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method.

Achieving near-peak performance still demands deep hardware expertise-experts either handcraft target-specific kernels (e.g., DeepSeek) or rely on specialized libraries (e.g., CUTLASS)-both of which add complexity and limit scalability for most ML practitioners.\n  This paper introduces a compilation scheme that automatically generates scalable, high-performance microkernels by leveraging the MLIR dialects to bridge domain-level operations and processor capabilities. Our approach removes dependence on low-level libraries by enabling the compiler to auto-generate near-optimal code directly. At its core is a mechanism for composing nanokernels from low-level IR constructs with near-optimal register utilization, forming efficient microkernels tailored to each target.

The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet.

Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u529f\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7b26\u53f7\u89e6\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u6b21\u5df2\u7ecf\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u822c\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training.

However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions.

Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data.

However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7387\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u548cAI\u504f\u89c1\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e00\u9879\u5305\u542b46\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6839\u636e\u662f\u5426\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u6216\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9AI\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7387\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u4e92\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u7387\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Traditional methods use a fixed temperature throughout training, which is suboptimal. Moreover, architectural differences between teacher and student often result in mismatched logit magnitudes. We demonstrate that students benefit from softer probabilities early in training but require sharper probabilities in later stages. We introduce Dynamic Temperature Scheduler (DTS), which adjusts temperature dynamically based on the cross-entropy loss gap between teacher and student. To our knowledge, this is the first temperature scheduling method that adapts based on the divergence between teacher and student distributions. Our method integrates seamlessly with existing KD frameworks. We validate DTS across multiple KD strategies on vision (CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet) and NLP tasks (GLUE, Dolly, SelfIns, UnNI, S-NI), consistently outperforming static-temperature baselines.

We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring.

Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model.

Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process.

We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps.

Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models.

Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.\n  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations.

A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2.

However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech.

Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework.

The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study.

This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users.

Although the current post hoc explanation methods offer valuable insights into feature importance, they are inherently disconnected from the model training process, limiting their faithfulness and utility. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approach to global explainability by design, integrating feature importance estimation directly into model training. Central to our method is the ScoresActivation function, a feature-ranking mechanism embedded within the learning pipeline. This integration enables models to prioritize features according to their contribution to predictive performance in a differentiable and end-to-end trainable manner. Evaluations across benchmark datasets show that our approach yields globally faithful, stable feature rankings aligned with SHAP values and ground-truth feature importance, while maintaining high predictive performance. Moreover, feature scoring is 150 times faster than the classical SHAP method, requiring only 2 seconds during training compared to SHAP's 300 seconds for feature ranking in the same configuration. Our method also improves classification accuracy by 11.24% with 10 features (5 relevant) and 29.33% with 16 features (5 relevant, 11 irrelevant), demonstrating robustness to irrelevant inputs.

However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO.

Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models.

We identify a major bottleneck:the long-tail distribution of rollout lengths, where a small fraction of long generations dominates wall clock time and a complementary opportunity; the availability of historical rollouts that reveal stable prompt level patterns across training epochs. Motivated by these observations, we propose DAS, a Distribution Aware Speculative decoding framework that accelerates RL rollouts without altering model outputs. DAS integrates two key ideas: an adaptive, nonparametric drafter built from recent rollouts using an incrementally maintained suffix tree, and a length aware speculation policy that allocates more aggressive draft budgets to long trajectories that dominate makespan. This design exploits rollout history to sustain acceptance while balancing base and token level costs during decoding.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a \"Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason\" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment.

Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates.

Procedural Warm-Up for Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data.

To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements.

Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities.

However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1.

Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates.

Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., \"lift hands more to generate more power\" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art.

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faEduHarm\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u76fe\u724c\u6846\u67b6TSSF\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6559\u80b2\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u76ca\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u76fe\u724c\u6846\u67b6\uff08TSSF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u65b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u5c42\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u9a71\u52a8\u53cc\u8def\u7531\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TSSF\u5728\u9632\u5fa1\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6b63\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "TSSF\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.\n  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.\n  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.", "AI": {"tldr": "RISE\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "RISE\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u89d2\u5ea6\u591a\u8def\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5230\u8fbe\u89d2\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c04\u89d2\uff0c\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u6b21\u7ea7\u53cd\u5c04\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u96f7\u8fbe\u54cd\u5e94\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "RISE\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5c06Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8660%\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8616cm\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u96f7\u8fbe\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0cIoU\u8fbe\u523058%\u3002", "conclusion": "RISE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u9759\u6001\u96f7\u8fbe\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention.

Our approach proceeds in two stages. First, we introduce a semantically aware labeling algorithm that, given a generated SQL and a gold reference, assigns node-level correctness without over-penalizing structural containers or alias variation. Second, we represent each node with a rich set of schema-aware and lexical features - capturing identifier validity, alias resolution, type compatibility, ambiguity in scope, and typo signals - and train a supervised classifier to predict per-node error probabilities. We interpret these probabilities as calibrated uncertainty, enabling fine-grained diagnostics that pinpoint exactly where a query is likely to be wrong.

Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5WaRPAD\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u826f\u597d\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5f97\u6781\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "WaRPAD\u7b97\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Haar\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u9891\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u8c03\u6574\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u500d\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5757\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u5747\u6240\u6709\u5757\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf923\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86WaRPAD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "WaRPAD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We first consider the setting where the loss is non-smooth and the optimizer interacts with a private proxy oracle, which sends only private messages about a minibatch of gradients. In this setting, we show that expected running time $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\})$ is necessary to achieve $\u03b1$ excess risk on problems of dimension $d$ when $d \\geq 1/\u03b1^2$. Upper bounds via DP-SGD show these results are tight when $d>\\tilde\u03a9(1/\u03b1^4)$. We further show our lower bound can be strengthened to $\u03a9(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\\bar{m}\u03b1^2}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)} \\})$ for algorithms which use minibatches of size at most $\\bar{m} < \\sqrt{d}$.

Compared to non-private lower bounds, our results show that differentially private optimizers pay a dimension dependent runtime penalty. Finally, as a natural extension of our proof technique, we show lower bounds in the non-smooth setting for optimizers interacting with information limited oracles. Specifically, if the proxy oracle transmits at most $\u0393$-bits of information about the gradients in the minibatch, then $\u03a9\\big(\\min\\{\\frac{d}{\u03b1^2\u0393}, \\frac{d}{\\log(1/\u03b1)}\\}\\big)$ oracle calls are needed.

The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability.

Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states.

Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels.

However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability.

We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f\uff08RC\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u66f2\u7387\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5f84\u5411\u8865\u507f\uff08RC\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7840\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f3c\u7136\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u6781\u70b9\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba9\u53c2\u6570\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "RC\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAEs\uff09\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u5f62\u6d41\u53ca\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "RC\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u534a\u5f84\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u4f7fRC-bExp\u6210\u4e3a\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

This dependency on \"big data\" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.\n  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification.

In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ee3\u8bcd\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u540d\u8bcd\u77ed\u8bed\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u53e5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u901a\u9053\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u9519\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates.

This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured \"Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train\" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions.

Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques.

The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faBCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u5584\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f1a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u534f\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5747\u5300\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528BCE3S\u7684LTR\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "BCE3S\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002"}}

While offloading experts to host memory is a common solution, it introduces a severe I/O bottleneck over the PCIe bus, as the data-dependent nature of expert selection places these synchronous transfers directly on the critical path of execution, crippling performance.\n  This paper argues that the I/O bottleneck can be overcome by trading a small amount of cheap, on-device computation to hide the immense cost of data movement. We present MoE-SpeQ, a new inference system built on a novel co-design of speculative execution and expert offloading. MoE-SpeQ employs a small, on-device draft model to predict the sequence of required experts for future tokens. This foresight enables a runtime orchestrator to prefetch these experts from host memory, effectively overlapping the expensive I/O with useful computation and hiding the latency from the critical path. To maximize performance, an adaptive governor, guided by an Amortization Roofline Model, dynamically tunes the speculation strategy to the underlying hardware. Our evaluation on memory-constrained devices shows that for the Phi-MoE model, MoE-SpeQ achieves at most 2.34x speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading framework.

Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training.

While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing.

The need for answering such \"when-if\" questions--how the timing of an event would change under a specified intervention--commonly arises in real-world settings with heterogeneous treatment adoption and confounding. To address these challenges, we propose Synthetic Survival Control (SSC) to estimate counterfactual hazard trajectories in a panel data setting where multiple units experience potentially different treatments over multiple periods. In such a setting, SSC estimates the counterfactual hazard trajectory for a unit of interest as a weighted combination of the observed trajectories from other units. To provide formal justification, we introduce a panel framework with a low-rank structure for causal survival analysis. Indeed, such a structure naturally arises under classical parametric survival models. Within this framework, for the causal estimand of interest, we establish identification and finite sample guarantees for SSC. We validate our approach using a multi-country clinical dataset of cancer treatment outcomes, where the staggered introduction of new therapies creates a quasi-experimental setting. Empirically, we find that access to novel treatments is associated with improved survival, as reflected by lower post-intervention hazard trajectories relative to their synthetic counterparts.

State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR.

Identifying and mitigating biases in LLMs is crucial to ensure fair outputs, as they can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative AI. We studied bias-specific benchmarks such as StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in multiple generative models such as BERT and GPT 3.5. We proposed an automated Bias-Identification Framework to recognize various social biases in LLMs such as gender, race, profession, and religion. We adopted a two-pronged approach to detect explicit and implicit biases in text data. Results indicated fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excelled at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings illustrated that despite having some success, LLMs often over-relied on keywords. To illuminate the capability of the analyzed LLMs in detecting implicit biases, we employed Bag-of-Words analysis and unveiled indications of implicit stereotyping within the vocabulary. To bolster the model performance, we applied an enhancement strategy involving fine-tuning models using prompting techniques and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks.

Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6MP-PVIR\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u884c\u4eba-\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u6240\u626e\u6f14\u7684\u5173\u952e\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u884c\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u5272\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5c42\u7efc\u5408\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "MP-PVIR\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u540c\u6b65\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\uff0c\u4ee5\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9884\u9632\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "MP-PVIR\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework.

At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection.

This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement.

Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LVLM O3SLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LVLM\u5728\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dLVLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u624b\u7ed8\u8349\u56fe\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf-\u8349\u56fe-\u6307\u4ee4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86O3SLM\u3002", "result": "O3SLM\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u4e8e\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8349\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "O3SLM\u5728\u8349\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684LVLM\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a unified MTP framework incorporating explainable navigation intentions, which we classify into sustained and transient categories. Our method constructs sustained intention trees from historical trajectories and models dynamic transient intentions using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), while using a non-local attention mechanism to maintain global scenario consistency.

To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMVI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cMVI-Sensitivity\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u8bef\u5bfc\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acbMVI-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165MVI-Sensitivity\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bf918\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLVLM\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "MVI-Bench\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets.

Our approach features: (1) a multi-scale VAE that learns a physiologically-disentangled latent space, separating rhythm, heart sounds, and murmurs; (2) a hierarchical text-to-biosignal pipeline that leverages rich clinical metadata for fine-grained control over 17 distinct conditions; and (3) an interpretable diffusion process guided by a novel Medical Attention module. Experiments on the PhysioNet CirCor dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a Fr\u00e9chet Audio Distance of 9.7, a 92% attribute disentanglement score, and 87.1% clinical validity confirmed by cardiologists.

While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene.

Small, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, coupled with high-dimensional and weakly identified clinical features, amplify this multiplicity and make conventional validation schemes unreliable. As a result, selecting among equally performing models becomes uncertain, particularly when resource constraints and operational priorities are not considered by conventional metrics like F1 score. To address these issues, we propose two complementary tools for robust model assessment and selection: Intervention Efficiency (IE) and the Perturbation Validation Framework (PVF). IE is a capacity-aware metric that quantifies how efficiently a model identifies actionable true positives when only limited interventions are feasible, thereby linking predictive performance with clinical utility. PVF introduces a structured approach to assess the stability of models under data perturbations, identifying models whose performance remains most invariant across noisy or shifted validation sets. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world healthcare datasets show that using these tools facilitates the selection of models that generalize more robustly and align with capacity constraints, offering a new direction for tackling the Rashomon Effect in clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u62c9\u5c14\u8499\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u5b58\u53ca\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u62c9\u5c14\u8499\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c0f\u3001\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\uff08IE\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bb9\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u771f\u5b9e\u6b63\u4f8b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PVF\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IE\u548cPVF\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u62c9\u5c14\u8499\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u6548\u7387\uff08IE\uff09\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff08PVF\uff09\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5e94\u5bf9\u62c9\u5c14\u8499\u6548\u5e94\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process.

The prevalent approach to handle this challenge is to aggregate a weighted combination of requirement violation penalties into the training objective. To be effective, this approach requires careful tuning of these hyperparameters (weights), involving trial-and-error and cross-validation, which becomes ineffective even for a moderate number of requirements. These issues are exacerbated when the requirements involve parities or equalities, as is the case in fairness and boundary value problems. An alternative technique uses constrained optimization to formulate these learning problems. Yet, existing approximation and generalization guarantees do not apply to problems involving equality constraints. In this work, we derive a generalization theory for equality-constrained statistical learning problems, showing that their solutions can be approximated using samples and rich parametrizations. Using these results, we propose a practical algorithm based on solving a sequence of unconstrained, empirical learning problems. We showcase its effectiveness and the new formulations enabled by equality constraints in fair learning, interpolating classifiers, and boundary value problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5e26\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e5f\u5728\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5e26\u6709\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7 deriving \u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u63d2\u503c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e86\u5e26\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames.

We present the first analysis of the influence of LoRA on state-of-the-art backdoor attacks targeting model adaptation in FL. Specifically, we focus on backdoor lifespan, a critical characteristic in FL, that can vary depending on the attack scenario and the attacker's ability to effectively inject the backdoor. A key finding in our experiments is that for an optimally injected backdoor, the backdoor persistence after the attack is longer when the LoRA's rank is lower.

Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set.

However, existing general-to-customized CMR methods typically assume that the entire target-domain data is available, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios and thus inevitably suffer from the query shift (QS) problem. Specifically, query shift embraces the following two characteristics and thus poses new challenges to CMR. i) Online Shift: real-world queries always arrive in an online manner, rendering it impractical to access the entire query set beforehand for customization approaches; ii) Diverse Shift: even with domain customization, the CMR models struggle to satisfy queries from diverse users or scenarios, leaving an urgent need to accommodate diverse queries. In this paper, we observe that QS would not only undermine the well-structured common space inherited from the source model, but also steer the model toward forgetting the indispensable general knowledge for CMR. Inspired by the observations, we propose a novel method for achieving online and harmonious adaptation against QS, dubbed Robust adaptation with quEry ShifT (REST). To deal with online shift, REST first refines the retrieval results to formulate the query predictions and accordingly designs a QS-robust objective function on these predictions to preserve the well-established common space in an online manner. As for tackling the more challenging diverse shift, REST employs a gradient decoupling module to dexterously manipulate the gradients during the adaptation process, thus preventing the CMR model from forgetting the general knowledge. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across three CMR tasks verify the effectiveness of our method against QS.", "AI": {"tldr": "REST is a novel approach for Cross-Modal Retrieval that addresses query shift challenges through online adaptation and gradient manipulation.", "motivation": "To tackle the query shift problem faced by existing general-to-customized Cross-Modal Retrieval methods in practical settings where complete target-domain data is not accessible.", "method": "The proposed method, REST, refines query predictions and utilizes a QS-robust objective function, along with a gradient decoupling module to adapt effectively to online and diverse shifts.", "result": "Experiments on 20 benchmarks across three tasks show that REST outperforms existing methods in mitigating query shift problems.", "conclusion": "REST effectively addresses query shift challenges in Cross-Modal Retrieval by refining retrieval results and employing a gradient decoupling module."}}

We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy.

Recently, we introduced ComplexEye, a multi-lens array microscope comprising 16 independent aberration-corrected glass lenses arranged at the pitch of a 96-well plate, capable of capturing high-resolution movies of migrating cells. This architecture enables high-throughput live-cell video microscopy for migration analysis, supporting routine quantification of autonomous motility with strong potential for clinical translation.

To address this challenge, we present FlowRoI, a fast optical-flow-based region of interest (RoI) extraction framework designed for high-throughput image compression in immune cell migration studies. FlowRoI estimates optical flow between consecutive frames and derives RoI masks that reliably cover nearly all migrating cells. The raw image and its corresponding RoI mask are then jointly encoded using JPEG2000 to enable RoI-aware compression.

To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images.

However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification.

Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers.

However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW).

To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition.

However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{PAFM}, a \\textbf{P}erturbation-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{F}low \\textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics.

We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge.

Recent offloading systems migrate the KVCache to CPU memory and incorporate top-k attention to reduce the volume of data transferred from the CPU, while further applying system-level optimizations such as on-GPU caching and prefetching to lower transfer overhead. However, they overlook the CPU bottleneck in three aspects: (1) substantial overhead of fine-grained dynamic cache management performed on the CPU side, (2) significant transfer overhead from poor PCIe bandwidth utilization caused by heavy gathering operations at the CPU side, and (3) GPU runtime bubbles introduced by coarse-grained CPU-centric synchronization. To address these challenges, we propose CLO, a CPU-light KVCache offloading system via algorithm-system co-design. CLO features: (1) a coarse-grained head-wise approximate on-GPU caching strategy with negligible cache management cost, (2) seamless combination of data prefetching and on-GPU persistent caching for lower transfer overhead, (3) a zero-copy transfer engine to fully exploit PCIe bandwidth, and a GPU-centric synchronization method to eliminate GPU stalls. Evaluation on two widely-used LLMs demonstrates that CLO achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art systems, while substantially minimizing CPU overhead, fully utilizing PCIe bandwidth, thus improving decoding throughput by 9.3%-66.6%.

Despite their progress, these models still face two major challenges. First, categorical sampling of discrete residue types collapses their continuous parameters into onehot assignments, while continuous variables (e.g., atom positions) evolve smoothly throughout the generation process. This mismatch disrupts the update dynamics and results in suboptimal performance. Second, current models assume unimodal distributions for side-chain torsion angles, which conflicts with the inherently multimodal nature of side chain rotameric states and limits prediction accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce PepBFN, the first Bayesian flow network for full atom peptide design that directly models parameter distributions in fully continuous space. Specifically, PepBFN models discrete residue types by learning their continuous parameter distributions, enabling joint and smooth Bayesian updates with other continuous structural parameters. It further employs a novel Gaussian mixture based Bayesian flow to capture the multimodal side chain rotameric states and a Matrix Fisher based Riemannian flow to directly model residue orientations on the $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ manifold. Together, these parameter distributions are progressively refined via Bayesian updates, yielding smooth and coherent peptide generation.

This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.\n  We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.\n  Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods.

Several Projection Quality Metrics (PQMs) have been developed as tools to quantify the goodness-of-fit of a DR projection; however, they mostly focus on measuring how well the projection captures the global or local structure of the data, without taking into account the visual distortion of the resulting plots, thus often ignoring the presence of outliers or artifacts that can mislead a visual analysis of the projection. In this work, we introduce the Warping Index (WI), a new metric for measuring the quality of DR projections onto the 2D plane, based on the assumption that the correct preservation of empty regions between points is of crucial importance towards a faithful visual representation of the data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u626d\u66f2\u6307\u6570\uff08WI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u964d\u7ef4\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4fdd\u6301\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u626d\u66f2\u53ca\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u626d\u66f2\u6307\u6570\uff08WI\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u5230\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7a7a\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors.

During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68\u00b0/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88\u00b0/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79\u00b0/2.45 mm on SpineDepth.

Most existing models adopt either \\textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \\textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management.

However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faDiff-NAF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u7a00\u89c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bCT\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d85\u7a00\u89c6\u91c7\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u51cf\u573a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDiff-NAF\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Diff-NAF\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u89c6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CT\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases.

These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement.

Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background.

Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating \"knowledge islands\" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts.

Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset).

For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception.

The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space.

However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u6ce8\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8bed\u4e49\u84b8\u998f\uff08RSD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u56e0\u679c\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff08E2E AD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RSD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Bench2Drive\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RSD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u9a7e\u9a76\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks.

An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries.

We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions.

Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities.

While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories.

We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \\net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision.

We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Submitted to ISBI2026", "summary": "Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.
