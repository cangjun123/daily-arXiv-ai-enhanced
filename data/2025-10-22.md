### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent是一种新的多智能体框架，通过实时优化提升多标签图像分类的准确性和效率，在多个数据集上取得了优异的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对传统方法在动态环境中表现不佳的问题，MAT-Agent旨在重构训练过程为协作实时优化。

Method: 提出MAT-Agent多智能体框架，通过动态调整数据增强、优化器、学习率和损失函数实现实时优化。

Result: MAT-Agent在多个数据集上表现优越，Pascal VOC上mAP达到97.4，COCO上mAP达92.8，VG-256上mAP为60.9。

Conclusion: MAT-Agent为优化复杂视觉模型提供了一种可扩展、智能化的解决方案，推动了自适应深度学习的发展。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO通过优化数据的重要性和多样性，改善了多模态大语言模型的数据选择，降低了计算成本，并在下游任务上实现了接近全数据微调的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对多模态大语言模型的训练成本高和数据选择不当的问题，提出了一种新的解决方案。

Method: 提出了CoIDO框架，结合双目标优化，通过轻量级插件评分器进行有效的数据选择。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为CoIDO的双目标框架，用于优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的数据选择，通过同时考虑数据的重要性和多样性，来克服现有方法中的高计算成本和子优化选择的问题。CoIDO使用轻量级的插件评分器，仅需对小随机样本进行训练以学习候选集的分布，从而显著降低计算需求。在实验中，CoIDO使用仅20%的随机样本数据进行训练，并在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型上验证，所选择的20%子集在十个下游任务中的平均性能达到了全数据微调的98.2%。

Conclusion: CoIDO有效地解决了现有数据选择方法的不足，提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，以平衡数据的重要性和多样性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的方法，通过潜在扩散模型早期预测胶质母细胞瘤的治疗反应，旨在改善个性化医学的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于患者在治疗反应上的高度异质性，提前预测治疗反应对于推进个性化医学具有重要意义。

Method: 研究采用潜在扩散模型，并结合了治疗前MRI和肿瘤定位信息进行条件生成，同时使用无分类器引导增强生成质量。

Result: 该方法在包含140名胶质母细胞瘤患者的本地数据集上进行训练和测试，成功生成了治疗后的MRI影像，以反映肿瘤演变。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用潜在扩散模型进行早期治疗反应预测的方法，以提高对胶质母细胞瘤患者的个性化治疗效果。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种嵌入基础的框架，用于检测AI生成图像与人类生成图像，并展示了其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成AI和大语言模型的进步，亟需解决数字内容的真实性和来源验证问题，以维护数字媒体的信任度和合法性。

Method: 使用图像嵌入和向量相似性，通过五个基准嵌入模型对AI和人类生成的图像进行处理。

Result: 本文提出了一种基于嵌入的AI图像检测框架，旨在区分AI生成的图像与人类创作的图像。该方法基于假设：AI生成的图像在嵌入空间中与其他AI内容的接近度更高，而人类生成的图像则在其领域内相似度较高。通过对多样的数据集进行实验，结果表明，该方法在面对图像干扰时表现出良好的鲁棒性，且能够实现准确且高效的检测。

Conclusion: 我们的解决方案为AI生成图像检测提供了一个可普适应用的框架，能够在准确性与计算效率之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We present ManzaiSet, the first large scale multimodal dataset of viewer
responses to Japanese manzai comedy, capturing facial videos and audio from 241
participants watching up to 10 professional performances in randomized order
(94.6 percent watched >= 8; analyses focus on n=228). This addresses the
Western centric bias in affective computing. Three key findings emerge: (1) k
means clustering identified three distinct viewer types: High and Stable
Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的后训练方法，通过速度场自蒸馏提升流匹配扩散模型的高效性，允许在几乎无额外成本的情况下实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的流匹配模型需要专门的步长嵌入，与现有模型不兼容，并且重新训练的过程过于昂贵，因此提出了更激进的快捷机制。

Method: 通过在速度场而非采样空间上工作，利用在线自导向蒸馏的快速学习，训练过程高效且成本低。

Result: 我们的 approach 可以在不到一天的时间内，生成一个 3 步的 Flux 模型，且支持在预训练阶段进行有效整合，提供几乎无成本的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种超高效的后训练方法，可以将大规模预训练的流匹配扩散模型转化为高效的少步采样器，并利用新颖的速度场自蒸馏技术进行支持。

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的混合方法，通过计算机视觉监测潜水员安全，有效识别潜水异常行为，提升潜水安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类活动识别方法在水下环境中效率低下，因此亟需一种新的方法来保障潜水员安全。

Method: 利用计算机视觉从3D人类关节关键点流生成"伪IMU"，同时将分类器整合到自主水下航行器(AUV)上。

Result: 实验展示了该方法在识别潜水员异常行为方面的有效性，能够及时发出医疗紧急情况的警报。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种创新的混合方法，通过计算机视觉生成高保真的运动数据，以提高潜水员安全监测的有效性。

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

TL;DR: InsideOut is a new method that combines RGB and X-ray imaging for improved visualization and testing, expanding the capabilities of 3D Gaussian splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind InsideOut is to bridge the gap between RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray structures, which is crucial for various fields.

Method: The method involves collecting paired RGB and X-ray data, hierarchical fitting for alignment, and employing an X-ray reference loss for structural consistency.

Result: This paper demonstrates that InsideOut can address issues related to disparate data representations and limited datasets, thereby broadening the use of 3DGS.

Conclusion: InsideOut enhances the application of 3D Gaussian splatting by effectively integrating RGB and X-ray imaging, improving visualization and non-destructive testing.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

TL;DR: MUSE是一种无训练的零-shot 2D物体检测和分割框架，在BOP挑战赛2025中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究旨在解决零-shot学习下的物体检测和分割的挑战，特别是在未见对象的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种无训练的MUSE框架，专为基于模型的零-shot 2D物体检测和分割设计。

Result: MUSE在BOP挑战赛2025上取得了最佳性能，在经典核心、H3和工业轨道中均排名第一。

Conclusion: MUSE提供了一种强大且可推广的框架，适用于零-shot 2D物体检测和分割。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了性别分类数据的偏差问题，通过构建BalancedFace数据集有效改善了分类模型的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类系统常常继承和放大训练数据中的人口不平衡现象，因此需要评估和改善强分类模型中的偏差。

Method: 审计现有性别分类数据集，训练MobileNetV2分类器评估公平性，并构建BalancedFace数据集以弥补缺失的不同人群样本。

Result: BalancedFace数据集的训练使最大真阳性率差距减少超过50%，并将平均不同影响评分提升63%，表现出良好的分类性能和公平性。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预措施对于实现公平的性别分类至关重要，BalancedFace数据集的构建显著改善了性别分类模型的公平性。

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对稠密逐点标注的依赖，提高基于稀疏或低成本注释数据的语义分割性能。

Method: 提出一种简单而有效的三维弱监督语义分割方法，整合三维几何先验与类别感知引导机制以生成高保真伪标签。

Result: 在ScanNet和S3DIS基准上实现了最先进的性能，并在无监督环境中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本研究展示的方法有效提升了伪标签质量，并通过自我训练策略扩展标签覆盖范围，从而提升了3D WSSS模型的性能。

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同分割模型在医学MRI图像中对伏隔核的表现，探讨了种族和性别对分割结果的影响，发现一些模型对种族匹配具有依赖性，而性别对分割的影响则更为明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习分割算法在医学影像分析中的快速发展，数据中的固有偏见，尤其是基于种族和性别的表现差异问题，愈发紧迫，因此我们研究不同模型在分割中的公平性。

Method: 我们评估了三种深度学习分割模型（UNesT、nnU-Net 和 CoTr）和一种传统的基于图谱的方法（ANTs），通过手动标注的金标准分割对左、右伏隔核进行分割，使用包含四个不同人口群体的MRI数据集进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型的分割性能评估显示，ANTs和UNesT在使用种族匹配的数据集上具有显著的分割准确性提升，而nnU-Net在多种族匹配中表现稳健。线性混合模型分析展示了人口变量对分割准确性及体积的影响。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，使用相同种族的训练数据可以显著提高一些分割模型的准确性，但不同模型对种族的匹配需求不同。同时，在手动分割和偏差模型中观察到了性别效应，而种族效应则在大多数模型中消失。

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving
student outcomes and personalizing instruction. We present ViBED-Net
(Video-Based Engagement Detection Network), a novel deep learning framework
designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Result: 该研究利用多种植物图像与高效机器学习和深度学习技术，提升了红棕螟的检测性能，优化了疾病分类过程。

Conclusion: 该研究开发了一种新的可解释AI框架TriggerNet，成功应用于红棕螟的检测，提高了植物分类和疾病识别的准确性及效率。

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Conclusion: HouseTour 通过结合 3D 相机轨迹的语言生成和图像处理，显著提升了视频生成的质量与效率，尤其适用于房地产和旅游领域。

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的个性化图像生成模型在从文本或单一图像合成图像方面表现出色，但在无需用户指定掩模或注释的情况下进行对象合成方面缺乏明确控制。

Method: 提出了Chimera模型，通过结合不同源图像的指定部分，依照文本指令生成新物体。

Result: 通过构建包含464个独特（部分，主题）对的语义原子数据集，Chimera能够生成37,000个提示，再利用高保真文本到图像模型合成相应图像。

Conclusion: 人类评估和提出的PartEval指标显示，Chimera在部分对齐、组成准确性和视觉质量方面均优于其他基线版本。

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Conclusion: 机器学习在微塑料检测中具有潜力，但需解决专家标注数据不足的挑战，以实现可靠训练和检测。

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Method: 提出了一种自适应补丁变换器（APT），采用不同的补丁大小对输入图像进行分块。

Result: APT在ViT推理和训练中实现了显著加速，ViT-L的吞吐量提升了40%，ViT-H提升了50%，并且可以快速收敛。

Conclusion: APT显著降低了高分辨率密集视觉任务中的训练和推理时间，提升了整体效率和表现。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) 在 3D 重建中展示了高效的渲染能力，并适用于多种应用，但仍面临内存占用高和光照效果处理等局限性。

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Motivation: 随着该领域对资源的持续追求，本研究关注于如何在低资源、预算有限的情况下调整视觉语言模型（VLM）。

Method: 提出了一种在线的In-Context Distillation (ICD) 方法，其中小的视觉语言模型（VLM）在推理时与更强的教师模型协作，通过稀疏示例提炼知识以有效弥补二者之间的差距。

Result: 我们的ICD方法在使用稀缺教师注释的情况下（低至4%）显著提升了小模型的性能（高达33%）。

Conclusion: 我们的方法显著提高了小模型的性能，使用低至4%的稀缺教师注释，甚至与教师的零-shot性能相竞争。

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: 本研究为以自然语言驱动的协作驾驶提供了安全和安全性的新见解，并提出了有效的防御管道SafeCoop。

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Method: 我们引入了World-in-World平台，对不同的生成世界模型进行了严格评估，优先考虑任务成功作为主要指标。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，视觉质量本身并不能保证任务成功，控制性更为重要。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

*Haoran Wei,Yaofeng Sun,Yukun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepSeek-OCR是一种新型OCR技术，能有效压缩长文本并实现高精度识别，具有较高的实际应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究压缩长文本上下文的可行性，以及提高OCR精度以支持更高效的信息处理。

Method: DeepSeek-OCR包括DeepEncoder作为编码器和DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M作为解码器，采用光学二位映射来压缩长文本。

Result: 即使在20倍的压缩比下，DeepSeek-OCR仍可达到约60%的OCR精度，并在多项测试中超越其他OCR系统。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR在压缩长文本上下文和光学字符识别精度方面具有良好前景，尤其是在历史文本和记忆遗忘机制的研究中具有潜在应用。

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

TL;DR: BlendCLIP是一个多模态预训练框架，旨在解决合成数据与真实世界LiDAR扫描之间的领域差距，从而提高零-shot 3D物体分类的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对合成数据与真实数据之间的显著领域差距，提升零-shot 3D物体分类的实际应用能力，特别是在自动驾驶领域。

Method: 提出了一种基于课程的数据混合策略，初始通过丰富的合成CAD数据进行模型训练，然后逐步适应真实世界的扫描特征。

Result: BlendCLIP通过引入1.5%的真实世界样本，显著提升了nuScenes基准测试的零-shot精度，最终模型在nuScenes上表现出色，优于之前的最佳方法19.3%。

Conclusion: 有效的领域适应是实现强大的开放词汇3D感知的关键，而无需全面的真实世界注释。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Conclusion: OpenInsGaussian在开放词汇3D高斯分割上取得了最先进的成果，展示了其在3D场景理解中的鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world
scenarios.

Result: 通过提取时间运动特征并将其应用于超曲面空间，优化学习得到了准确且平滑的人类网格，实验结果优于大多数现有方法。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的超曲面空间学习方法，通过利用时间运动先验来从视频中恢复3D人类网格，并在实验中显示了优越性。

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 我们的基准提供了推进水下视觉-语言研究的必要资源，并支持海洋科学、生态监测和自主水下探测等应用。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.
Our code and benchmark will be available.

Motivation: 针对在医疗图像分割任务中传统联邦学习方法未能有效处理跨域场景的信息聚合不平衡问题，导致全球漂移，迫切需要研究新的方法来提高模型的泛化性能。

Method: 设计了一种基于树状拓扑的层次参数聚合方法，结合基于参数差异的风格混合方法（FedStyle）和渐进个性化融合策略，增强了在推理阶段的特征相似性引导的模型链检索。

Result: 提出了一种新的树状拓扑框架TreeFedDG，结合阶层参数聚合和风格混合策略，显著提升了模型在医疗图像分割中的跨域鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，TreeFedDG方法在多个公开数据集上优于其他最先进的领域泛化方法，并在跨域性能上实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出的StreamingTOM框架通过因果时间减少和在线量化存储显著提高流媒体视频处理的效率，降低了内存占用和处理时间，同时保持了较高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在流媒体视频视觉语言模型中，存在因果性和累积性两大约束，这些约束限制了模型的效率和性能。

Method: 通过因果时间减少和在线量化存储技术，StreamingTOM在每帧中只处理与变化相关的视觉标记，从而降低了处理成本并保持了kv-cache的有效性。

Result: StreamingTOM框架有效解决了预LLM和后LLM的效率瓶颈，实现了可预测的延迟效果。

Conclusion: StreamingTOM的两个阶段方法在效率和准确性上表现出色，推动了流媒体视频理解的实际应用。

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Motivation: 提出一种新颖的度量深度估计框架，以解决单幅图像条件下绝对度量深度估计的挑战，尤其是由于尺度模糊而造成的困难。

Method: 将深度估计重新构建为一个逆问题，利用条件于RGB图像的预训练潜在扩散模型及基于立体的几何约束来学习尺度和偏移，从而实现准确的深度估计。

Result: 该方法在经历大量实验后，展示了在多个环境中匹配或超越现有最先进方法的能力，尤其是在处理半透明和反射表面时表现突出。

Conclusion: 我们的解决方案无需重新训练即能无缝集成进现有框架，在复杂环境中获得准确的深度恢复。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: Med-RwR通过整合外部知识，提高了医疗模型在未见领域的推理能力，展示了其在医疗应用中的潜力和重要性。

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Conclusion: 优先考虑原生分辨率推理和混合分辨率数据集，以优化医学MLLMs。

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Conclusion: Adaptive Token Ensemble Decoding (ATED)显著降低了大规模视觉语言模型的对象幻觉现象，提升了模型在高风险应用中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Conclusion: 优化视觉空间对于零样本学习是有利的，所提的基于原型的方法达到了新的最佳性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot learning, which aims to recognize new categories that are not
included in the training set, has gained popularity owing to its potential
ability in the real-word applications. Zero-shot learning models rely on
learning an embedding space, where both semantic descriptions of classes and
visual features of instances can be embedded for nearest neighbor search.
Recently, most of the existing works consider the visual space formulated by
deep visual features as an ideal choice of the embedding space. However, the
discrete distribution of instances in the visual space makes the data structure
unremarkable. We argue that optimizing the visual space is crucial as it allows
semantic vectors to be embedded into the visual space more effectively. In this
work, we propose two strategies to accomplish this purpose. One is the visual
prototype based method, which learns a visual prototype for each visual class,
so that, in the visual space, a class can be represented by a prototype feature
instead of a series of discrete visual features. The other is to optimize the
visual feature structure in an intermediate embedding space, and in this method
we successfully devise a multilayer perceptron framework based algorithm that
is able to learn the common intermediate embedding space and meanwhile to make
the visual data structure more distinctive. Through extensive experimental
evaluation on four benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that optimizing visual
space is beneficial for zero-shot learning. Besides, the proposed prototype
based method achieves the new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的偏好学习框架Diffusion-DRO，通过将偏好学习视为排序问题，解决了现有方法中的非线性估计问题，并融合了离线专家示范和在线策略生成的负样本，从而提高了生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DPO方法面临图像概率估计不准确和离线数据多样性有限的挑战，因此需要开发新的方法来提升生成质量。

Method: Diffusion-DRO通过将偏好学习转化为排序问题，简化了训练目标为去噪公式，同时整合了离线专家示范和在线生成的负样本。

Result: Diffusion-DRO在量化指标和用户研究中均展现出卓越的性能，超过了现有的最先进基准。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO显著提高了在各种挑战性和未见提示下的生成质量，优于现有的基准方法。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: 本研究提出GroupHOI框架，从群体视角重新建模人-物互动，显著提高了HOI检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要集中于人-物对的关系建模，而忽视了集体行为中多个人与物体的互动关系。

Method: 提出GroupHOI框架，通过几何接近性和语义相似性来传播上下文信息。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准上进行了广泛实验，展示了GroupHOI的优越性，特别是在NVI-DET任务中的表现。

Conclusion: GroupHOI在HOI检测任务中优于现有方法，尤其在复杂的非言语互动检测任务上表现突出。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatureFool是一种新颖的零查询黑箱攻击方法，专门针对视频分类器，能够高效、隐蔽地进行对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有黑箱对抗攻击需要多轮交互和大量查询的问题，以及在视频领域直接利用特征图进行攻击的缺乏

Method: 提出了一种名为FeatureFool的零查询黑箱攻击方法

Result: FeatureFool在没有任何查询的情况下实现了超过70%的攻击成功率，并能有效绕过视频识别系统的检测

Conclusion: FeatureFool的方法在视频领域是前所未有的，其攻击效果显著，且生成的视频质量极高，几乎不可察觉。

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像复杂性评估方法不能充分捕捉与复杂性相关的感知表示，因此需要探讨跨模态场景语义信息。

Method: CM-SSA包括复杂性回归分支和场景语义对齐分支，通过对齐图像和对应文本提示来实现对复杂性水平的估计。

Result: 大量实验表明，CM-SSA在图像复杂性评估上显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: CM-SSA方法在各类图像复杂性评估数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Conclusion: S2AP方法通过降低评分空间的尖锐度，稳定掩码选择，从而提高了对抗剪枝方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用2倍深度扩展的DeiT-Base模型，ScaleNet比从零开始训练提高了7.42%的准确率，并且只需三分之一的训练周期。

Conclusion: ScaleNet在扩展视觉变换器模型中表现出色，提供了一种高效且经济的方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Conclusion: RISE方法在无监督和基于提示的方法中表现优越，展示了使用无注释的训练数据集进行高效学习的潜力。

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a

enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机在于提升潜在扩散模型（LDMs）的视觉标记器的质量和鲁棒性，旨在克服现有蒸馏方法带来的对齐问题。

Method: 本文提出的VFM-VAE通过多尺度潜在融合和渐进分辨率重构来解决视觉基础模型与像素级保真度之间的张力，并引入了一种新的对齐策略以加速收敛。

Result: 该论文提出了一种针对潜在扩散模型（LDMs）视觉标记器的改进方法。研究指出，现有的通过蒸馏集成视觉基础模型（VFM）的方法在对齐的鲁棒性上存在缺陷，导致语义偏离。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了一种更加直接的方法：视觉基础模型变分自编码器（VFM-VAE）。通过重新设计VFM-VAE解码器，引入多尺度潜在融合和渐进分辨率重构块，能够从空间粗糙的VFM特征中进行高质量重构。此外，论文提供了扩散训练中表征动态的综合分析，提出了SE-CKNNA指标，以更准确地进行诊断。这一分析促成了联合标记器-扩散对齐策略的发展，显著加快了收敛速度。研究的创新在于标记器设计和训练策略的优化，使得系统在仅80个周期内达到gFID（无CFG）为2.20，相比于之前的标记器实现了10倍的加速，经过640个周期的继续训练，gFID进一步降至1.62，验证了直接集成VFM作为LDMs的优越范式。

Conclusion: 研究表明，直接集成视觉基础模型（VFM）为潜在扩散模型（LDMs）提供了一种更优越的方案，显著提高了性能和训练效率。

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR 提供了一种新的方法，通过两阶段优化和时域光度规整来提升 HDR 场景重建的效果。

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便利包装的增加导致大量废物的产生，因此高效的废物分类对可持续废物管理至关重要。

Method: 使用多种图像分类和目标检测模型，对自有废物数据集进行基准测试，采用自定义工具Annotated Lab进行数据标注，探索模型的准确性、延迟和碳排放等特性。

Result: 开发了DWaste平台，利用计算机视觉技术实现资源受限智能手机和边缘设备上的实时废物分类。

Conclusion: 我们的研究证明了“更绿色人工智能”模型在边缘设备上实现实时可持续废物分类的成功。

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服模板检索不准确导致的姿态预测错误。

Method: 将基于模板的物体姿态估计重新表述为光线对齐问题，并嵌入扩散变换器架构中。

Result: 通过使用我们的模型，与多种基准数据集上的最新方法相比，在未见物体姿态估计中取得了具有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多个基准数据集上表现优异，有效解决了传统模板匹配中的局限性。

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶中感知在恶劣条件下的可靠性问题，现有数据集缺乏对多种传感器模态的可控、参数化和可重复的退化测试。

Method: 为相机、雷达和LiDAR提供多种类型的遮挡和退化脚本，以实现灵活的退化数据生成。

Result: 推出Occluded nuScenes Dataset，这是nuScenes基准的一个新扩展，支持多种传感器的退化评估。

Conclusion: 此数据集将推动关于强健传感器融合、恢复能力分析和安全关键感知的研究。

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Motivation: 现有的S2V生成模型在多主题一致性与背景解耦方面仍显不足，导致低保真度和语义漂移。

Method: 提出了一种专用的数据构建管道和参考旋转位置编码(R-RoPE)机制，以增强多图像整合的稳定性与精确性。

Result: Kaleido通过数据过滤和多样性合成生成了一致性保留的训练数据，并在多个基准上进行广泛实验，得到显著提升。

Conclusion: Kaleido在一致性、保真度和泛化能力方面显著优于以前的方法，标志着S2V生成的进步。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Motivation: 现有的方法通过冻结文本编码器并只更新图像编码器和文本投影层来解决可扩展性问题，但这限制了语义对齐，成为性能扩展的瓶颈。

Method: 提出了一种名为CovMatch的可扩展数据蒸馏框架，旨在对真实和合成特征的跨协方差进行对齐，同时规整每个模态内的特征分布。

Result: CovMatch在Flickr30K和COCO数据集上的测试中，优于现有的多模态蒸馏方法，使用仅500个合成对，实现了高达6.8%的检索准确率绝对增益。

Conclusion: CovMatch超越了现有的多模态数据蒸馏方法，通过联合优化文本和图像编码器，显著提升了跨模态对齐和检索准确率。

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Motivation: 解决现有推理方法在处理3D空间关系时的局限性，特别是缺乏3D先验输入及标记数据。

Method: 通过两阶段训练，首先对齐VLM生成的3D潜在空间与3D基础模型，然后基于结果信号优化推理轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，3DThinker一致性表现超过竞争方法。

Conclusion: 3DThinker优于强基线，并为将3D表示统一到多模态推理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: {	ext{ε}}-Seg方法能够在有限的训练标签下，对复杂生物图像数据实现竞争力的稀疏监督分割。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

Motivation: 历史写作者识别仍然是一个挑战性任务，受限于手写风格多样性、文档退化和标签样本数量少等因素。

Method: 通过实验探讨了不同的预处理方法、主干架构和后处理策略，如文本分割、补丁采样和特征聚合。

Result: 大多数配置表现不佳，主要由于低级视觉特征捕捉薄弱、不一致的补丁表示和对内容噪声的高敏感性，发现一种端到端设置的性能与顶尖系统相当。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了构建健壮端到端系统的主要挑战，并提供了改进历史文档写作者识别性能的设计思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Transformers在生成长视频时被全注意力的二次扩展所限制的问题，提升长视频生成的效率。

Method: 提出了Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA)机制，结合轻量级语义感知路由，实现无块估计的精确令牌匹配。

Result: 本论文介绍了一种名为Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA)的新型稀疏注意力机制，旨在解决Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)在生成长视频时受限于序列长度的全注意力的二次扩展问题。通过使用轻量级可学习的令牌路由，MoGA能够精确匹配令牌，从而消除了块状估计的需求。MoGA通过语义感知路由实现了有效的长距离交互，并且作为无核方法，能够与现代注意力架构无缝整合，比如FlashAttention和序列并行。基于MoGA，我们开发了一种高效的长视频生成模型，能够端到端生成分钟级、多段480p视频，帧率为24 fps，上下文长度约为580k。通过针对多种视频生成任务的全面实验，验证了我们方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MoGA有效提升了长视频生成的效率和质量，通过实验验证了其在视频生成任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 本文提出了UniGenBench++，一个统一的语义评估基准，用于文本到图像（T2I）生成，解决了现有基准在多样性和细致评估方面的不足。该基准包含600个按层级组织的提示，涵盖5个主要主题和20个子主题，支持中英文多样化，评估10个主要和27个子标准的语义一致性。通过多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）Gemini-2.5-Pro，构建了有效的基准评估模型，以系统揭示T2I模型的优缺点。

Conclusion: UniGenBench++为文本到图像生成提供了一种新的评估标准，能够系统性地分析模型的优缺点，促进该领域的研究与应用。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

Result: SeeTok在三个语言任务中表现出色，所需的token数量减少了4.43倍，FLOPs降低了70.5%，并增强了跨语言泛化和抗干扰能力。

Conclusion: SeeTok提供了一种更接近人类视觉阅读的文本处理方法，优于传统的子词分词方式。

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Motivation: 目前的对比视觉语言模型在处理复杂的网页文档时能力有限，尤其是在文本和图像交错、不紧密对齐或以视觉形式嵌入的场景中。因此，提出一种新的模型来提升其处理能力。

Method: VC2L通过一个单一的视觉变换器在像素空间中统一建模文本和图像，并引入片段级对比学习目标，无需OCR或文本标记。

Result: VC2L在多个基准测试中显示出优越的性能，超越了传统的CLIP模型，表现出更强的跨模态检索和细粒度理解能力。

Conclusion: VC2L展示了在多模态表示学习中的潜力，特别是在利用多模态网页数据进行对比学习时。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，EMIM模块显著提升了运动敏感数据集上的动作识别能力，超过了现有的方法。

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩方法，通过解耦空间局部头和语义汇头，有效降低了自回归图像生成的资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归图像生成模型在内存和计算需求方面的高成本问题，尤其是在视觉标记数量众多的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种新的KV缓存压缩框架，通过适应性地解耦注意力头以减少内存使用。

Result: 在保证视觉质量仅有最小损失的情况下，实现了5倍的内存使用减少和6.6倍的整体吞吐量加速。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限的硬件上实现高效的自回归图像生成奠定了基础。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型在视频字幕生成方面的应用需要更符合用户指令的字幕，而现有基准主要评估描述的全面性。

Method: 建立了一个包含1400个高质量样本的基准，评估字幕的格式正确性和内容正确性。

Result: 通过对20多个重要模型进行评估，发现尽管专有模型仍然占优势，但顶级开源解决方案的表现正在接近。同时，专注于密集字幕的模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了IF-VidCap基准，以便更好地评估可控的视频字幕生成，强调了遵循用户指令的重要性。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Result: ColIAGS在新视图合成和几何重建方面取得了卓越的性能，超越了其他先进方法。

Conclusion: ColIAGS显著提高了渲染的真实感和几何重建的准确性，提供了更优的输出结果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Result: SEAL在SSB基准、Oxford-Pet和Herbarium19数据集上 consistently达到了最先进的性能，并在更粗粒度的数据集上展示了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效提升了广义类别发现的性能，尤其在细粒度基准数据集上表现优越，同时在粗粒度数据集上也展现了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Conclusion: 基础模型为评估城市热岛缓解策略提供了强有力的方法，尤其是在数据稀缺的地区，有助于支持气候适应性更强的城市发展。

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Conclusion: UltraGen 通过创新的双分支注意力架构和高效的全局建模策略，在生成高分辨率视频方面展现出显著的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

Result: 本文提出ProCLIP，一种基于课程学习的渐进式视觉-语言对齐框架，旨在解决CLIP文本编码器在长文本处理和多语言理解方面的局限性。通过从CLIP的文本编码器提取知识并与LLM基础的嵌入模型对齐，同时利用自蒸馏正则化技术防止过拟合，ProCLIP有效提高了图像编码器与文本嵌入器之间的对齐效果。

Conclusion: ProCLIP通过课程学习和自蒸馏等技术，成功提升了图像编码器对LLM嵌入模型的对齐效果，展现了其在视觉-语言理解任务中的潜力。

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Result: SAM 2++在不同粒度的视频追踪任务上树立了新的技术标准，提供了一种统一且强大的追踪框架。

Conclusion: SAM 2++通过悠整合不同粒度的追踪任务，实现了性能的显著提升，成为视频追踪领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验证明，M3Dphormer在捕捉复杂节点交互方面展现出优越性，确保了模型的有效性和灵活性。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: 基于感知偏好的优化方法能够有效提升图像超分辨率的性能，特别是在不同规模的模型上展示出不同的优化效果。

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSI-Bench揭示了现有视觉语言模型和视觉专家模型在动态3D场景中的主要限制，并为未来的模型开发提供了宝贵的见解和发现。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了POPI框架，通过偏好推断模型优化个性化生成，提升准确性并减少开销，同时支持现成模型的个性化应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化技术往往忽视了用户间的个体差异，且现有的一些策略效率低下，因而需要一种新颖的框架来提升个性化性能。

Method: 通过引入偏好推断模型，在统一目标下同时优化偏好推断和个性化生成，利用强化学习进行训练。

Result: POPI在四个个性化基准上进行广泛实验，显示出显著提高个性化准确性和减少上下文开销的能力。

Conclusion: POPI框架实现了更高的个性化准确性，并减少了上下文开销，能够无缝迁移至现成的大型语言模型，支持即插即用的个性化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, yet user
experiences remain inconsistent due to diverse preferences in style, tone, and
reasoning mode. Nevertheless, existing alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) largely optimize toward population-level averages and
overlook individual variation. Naive personalization strategies like per-user
fine-tuning are computationally prohibitive, and in-context approaches that
prepend raw user signals often suffer from inefficiency and noise. To address
these challenges, we propose POPI, a general framework that introduces a
preference inference model to distill heterogeneous user signals into concise
natural language summaries. These summaries act as transparent, compact, and
transferable personalization representations that condition a shared generation
model to produce personalized responses. POPI jointly optimizes both preference
inference and personalized generation under a unified objective using
reinforcement learning, ensuring summaries maximally encode useful preference
information. Extensive experiments across four personalization benchmarks
demonstrate that POPI consistently improves personalization accuracy while
reducing context overhead by a large margin. Moreover, optimized summaries
seamlessly transfer to frozen off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling plug-and-play
personalization without weight updates.

TL;DR: 本研究通过增强大型语言模型的预训练数据，使其包含真实世界的背景信息，显著提升了模型的安全性和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型的幻觉和可信度问题，提高模型在实际工业场景中的表现。

Method: 在JT-35B-Base的基础上继续预训练，使用了1.5万亿个世界背景数据（DWC）token，并引入后训练程序以激活DWC的潜力。

Result: 相比于相似规模的Qwen模型，JT-Safe-35B在安全性和可信度评估基准上平均提高了1.79%的表现，且只使用了6.2万亿个token进行预训练。

Conclusion: 通过增强预训练数据以包含世界背景信息，我们显著提高了大型语言模型的安全性和可信度。

Abstract: The hallucination and credibility concerns of large language models (LLMs)
are global challenges that the industry is collectively addressing. Recently, a
significant amount of advances have been made on post-training and inference
techniques to mitigate these challenges. However, it is widely agreed that
unsafe and hallucinations of LLMs intrinsically originate from pre-training,
involving pre-training data and the next-token prediction learning mechanism.
In this paper, we focus on enhancing pre-training data to improve the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs. Since the data is vast, it's almost
impossible to entirely purge the data of factual errors, logical
inconsistencies, or distributional biases. Moreover, the pre-training data lack
grounding in real-world knowledge. Each piece of data is treated as a sequence
of tokens rather than as a representation of a part of the world. To overcome
these issues, we propose approaches to enhancing our pre-training data with its
context in the world and increasing a substantial amount of data reflecting
industrial scenarios. We argue that most source data are created by the authors
for specific purposes in a certain spatial-temporal context. They have played a
role in the real world. By incorporating related world context information, we
aim to better anchor pre-training data within real-world scenarios, thereby
reducing uncertainty in model training and enhancing the model's safety and
trustworthiness. We refer to our Data with World Context as DWC. We continue
pre-training an earlier checkpoint of JT-35B-Base with 1.5 trillion of DWC
tokens. We introduce our post-training procedures to activate the potentials of
DWC. Compared with the Qwen model of a similar scale, JT-Safe-35B achieves an
average performance improvement of 1.79% on the Safety and Trustworthy
evaluation benchmarks, while being pretrained with only 6.2 trillion tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在任务分解过程中平衡性能与成本，以提高大型语言模型的应用效率。

Method: 通过对任务分解的全面调查，识别六种分类方案，并分析影响任务分解性能和成本的三个因素。

Result: 提出Select-Then-Decompose策略, 在多个基准测试中表现优异, 始终位于帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: Select-Then-Decompose策略在性能与成本之间实现了最佳平衡，表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning and
planning capabilities, driving extensive research into task decomposition.
Existing task decomposition methods focus primarily on memory, tool usage, and
feedback mechanisms, achieving notable success in specific domains, but they
often overlook the trade-off between performance and cost. In this study, we
first conduct a comprehensive investigation on task decomposition, identifying
six categorization schemes. Then, we perform an empirical analysis of three
factors that influence the performance and cost of task decomposition:
categories of approaches, characteristics of tasks, and configuration of
decomposition and execution models, uncovering three critical insights and
summarizing a set of practical principles. Building on this analysis, we
propose the Select-Then-Decompose strategy, which establishes a closed-loop
problem-solving process composed of three stages: selection, execution, and
verification. This strategy dynamically selects the most suitable decomposition
approach based on task characteristics and enhances the reliability of the
results through a verification module. Comprehensive evaluations across
multiple benchmarks show that the Select-Then-Decompose consistently lies on
the Pareto frontier, demonstrating an optimal balance between performance and
cost. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的许多农民在获取及时、专业的农业指导方面面临挑战。

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合光学字符识别(OCR)和文档解析管道，构建农业咨询平台。

Result: 在试点评估中，KrishokBondhu对72.7%的多样化农业问题生成了高质量的响应，并在不同维度上显著提升了回答的质量。

Conclusion: KrishokBondhu展示了将呼叫中心可访问性、多语言语音交互与现代RAG技术集成的可行性，能够为偏远的孟加拉国农民提供专家级农业指导。

Abstract: In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely,
expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a
voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for
Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural
handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the
content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic
retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system
to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali
query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma
3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the
answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced
high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop
management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the
KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on
a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual
richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable
relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further
revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality,
emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated
documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating
call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG
techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi
farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory
ecosystem.

Conclusion: 研究结果强化了在动态在线游戏环境中部署高效、经济的内容审查系统的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) methods for automated toxicity detection in online gaming
chats. Traditional machine learning models with embeddings, large language
models (LLMs) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting, fine-tuned transformer
models, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches are evaluated. The
evaluation framework assesses three critical dimensions: classification
accuracy, processing speed, and computational costs. A hybrid moderation system
architecture is proposed that optimizes human moderator workload through
automated detection and incorporates continuous learning mechanisms. The
experimental results demonstrate significant performance variations across
methods, with fine-tuned DistilBERT achieving optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.
The findings provide empirical evidence for deploying cost-effective, efficient
content moderation systems in dynamic online gaming environments.

Motivation: 在嘈杂的口语数据中扩展命名实体识别模型以识别新的个人身份信息（PII）实体的需求。

Method: 通过联合微调BERT模型与增量学习设置，测量语义漂移以分析模型适应性。

Result: 共同微调BERT模型对标准语义实体和新模式基础的PII进行处理，最小化了原始类的性能下降，并发现了语义漂移的两大关键洞见。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了命名实体识别模型适应性的机械诊断，强调了特征独立性、表示重叠以及'O'标签的可塑性。

Abstract: Extending Named Entity Recognition (NER) models to new PII entities in noisy
spoken-language data is a common need. We find that jointly fine-tuning a BERT
model on standard semantic entities (PER, LOC, ORG) and new pattern-based PII
(EMAIL, PHONE) results in minimal degradation for original classes. We
investigate this "peaceful coexistence," hypothesizing that the model uses
independent semantic vs. morphological feature mechanisms.
  Using an incremental learning setup as a diagnostic tool, we measure semantic
drift and find two key insights. First, the LOC (location) entity is uniquely
vulnerable due to a representation overlap with new PII, as it shares
pattern-like features (e.g., postal codes). Second, we identify a "reverse
O-tag representation drift." The model, initially trained to map PII patterns
to 'O', blocks new learning. This is resolved only by unfreezing the 'O' tag's
classifier, allowing the background class to adapt and "release" these
patterns. This work provides a mechanistic diagnosis of NER model adaptation,
highlighting feature independence, representation overlap, and 'O' tag
plasticity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于美国食物不安全与慢性疾病、心理健康和药物滥用密切相关，现有系统的不足导致弱势群体难以获取所需资源，因此开发Food4All的动机是迫切的。

Method: 通过异构数据聚合、轻量级的强化学习算法以及在线反馈机制，Food4All实现了对食物资源的智能检索和优化。

Result: Food4All通过综合利用多种数据源和算法，提供一个经过优化的食物检索系统，帮助弱势群体获取所需食物资源。

Conclusion: Food4All提供了一种创新的解决方案，通过实时、上下文感知的资源获取，帮助应对食物不安全问题。

Abstract: Food insecurity remains a persistent public health emergency in the United
States, tightly interwoven with chronic disease, mental illness, and opioid
misuse. Yet despite the existence of thousands of food banks and pantries,
access remains fragmented: 1) current retrieval systems depend on static
directories or generic search engines, which provide incomplete and
geographically irrelevant results; 2) LLM-based chatbots offer only vague
nutritional suggestions and fail to adapt to real-world constraints such as
time, mobility, and transportation; and 3) existing food recommendation systems
optimize for culinary diversity but overlook survival-critical needs of
food-insecure populations, including immediate proximity, verified
availability, and contextual barriers. These limitations risk leaving the most
vulnerable individuals, those experiencing homelessness, addiction, or digital
illiteracy, unable to access urgently needed resources. To address this, we
introduce Food4All, the first multi-agent framework explicitly designed for
real-time, context-aware free food retrieval. Food4All unifies three
innovations: 1) heterogeneous data aggregation across official databases,
community platforms, and social media to provide a continuously updated pool of
food resources; 2) a lightweight reinforcement learning algorithm trained on
curated cases to optimize for both geographic accessibility and nutritional
correctness; and 3) an online feedback loop that dynamically adapts retrieval
policies to evolving user needs. By bridging information acquisition, semantic
analysis, and decision support, Food4All delivers nutritionally annotated and
guidance at the point of need. This framework establishes an urgent step toward
scalable, equitable, and intelligent systems that directly support populations
facing food insecurity and its compounding health risks.

TL;DR: AtlasKV是一种新方法，通过高效整合知识图谱，克服了以往方法的推理延迟、高资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的检索增强生成方法对外部检索模块高度依赖，导致推理延迟显著，因此需要探索更高效的知识整合方法。

Method: 在AtlasKV中，引入KG2KV和HiKVP将知识图谱三元组有效整合到大型语言模型中，实现亚线性时间和内存复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，AtlasKV在知识基础和泛化能力上，利用自身的注意力机制保持了较强的性能，而且适应新知识时不需要外部检索器、长上下文先前信息或重训练。

Conclusion: AtlasKV是一种可扩展有效的知识整合方法，能够实现大规模知识图谱的集成，且在性能上优于传统的检索增强生成方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown some success in augmenting
large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, as a
non-parametric knowledge integration paradigm for LLMs, RAG methods heavily
rely on external retrieval modules and the retrieved textual context prior.
Especially for very large scale knowledge augmentation, they would introduce
substantial inference latency due to expensive searches and much longer
relevant context. In this paper, we propose a parametric knowledge integration
method, called \textbf{AtlasKV}, a scalable, effective, and general way to
augment LLMs with billion-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g. 1B triples) using
very little GPU memory cost (e.g. less than 20GB VRAM). In AtlasKV, we
introduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with
sub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding
and generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,
and requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when
adapting to new knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在动态复杂环境中难以充分利用历史交互信息，现有的内存系统存在时间和计算开销大的问题。

Method: LightMem灵感源自阿特金森-希夫林人类记忆模型，将内存组织为三个阶段：感官记忆、短期记忆和长期记忆，有效管理信息的存储与检索。

Result: LightMem在LongMemEval实验中显示出相较于强基线模型的准确性提高，最大增幅达10.9%，同时减少了117倍的token使用，159倍的API调用，以及12倍以上的运行时间。

Conclusion: LightMem在保持较高准确率的同时，显著减少了资源消耗和运行时间，表明其在效率和性能之间取得了良好的平衡。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle
to effectively leverage historical interaction information in dynamic and
complex environments. Memory systems enable LLMs to move beyond stateless
interactions by introducing persistent information storage, retrieval, and
utilization mechanisms. However, existing memory systems often introduce
substantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new
memory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance
and efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of
human memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,
cognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information
through lightweight compression and groups information according to their
topics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based
groups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,
long-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that
decouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with
GPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in
accuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API
calls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x. The code is available at

Method: 建立一个框架来测量信念深度，并通过线性探查等方法进行评估。

Result: 简单的提示和机械编辑技术未能有效植入知识，而合成文档微调（SDF）技术则能有效植入知识，但在某些情况下存在脆弱性。

Conclusion: 知识编辑技术在大型语言模型中的应用效果具有可测量性，但其深度和稳定性存在问题，尤其是与基本常识相矛盾时。

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques promise to implant new factual knowledge into
large language models (LLMs). But do LLMs really believe these facts? We
develop a framework to measure belief depth and use it to evaluate the success
of knowledge editing techniques. We operationalize belief depth as the extent
to which implanted knowledge 1) generalizes to related contexts (e.g. Fermi
estimates several logical steps removed), 2) is robust to self-scrutiny and
direct challenge, and 3) is represented similarly to genuine knowledge (as
measured by linear probes). Our evaluations show that simple prompting and
mechanistic editing techniques fail to implant knowledge deeply. In contrast,
Synthetic Document Finetuning (SDF) - where models are trained on LLM-generated
documents consistent with a fact - often succeeds at implanting beliefs that
behave similarly to genuine knowledge. However, SDF's success is not universal,
as implanted beliefs that contradict basic world knowledge are brittle and
representationally distinct from genuine knowledge. Overall, our work
introduces measurable criteria for belief depth and enables the rigorous
evaluation necessary for deploying knowledge editing in real-world
applications.

Motivation: 现代语言模型在大型基准上评估，评估结果难以理解，特别是在模型选择时。

Method: 提出SimBA框架，包括三个阶段：stalk进行数据集与模型比较，prowl发现代表性子集，pounce用于根据代表性子集预测未见模型的表现。

Result: 应用SimBA于HELM、MMLU和BigBenchLite三个流行基准，发现数据集与模型之间有很强的相关性，并通过代表性集合发现算法实现覆盖率95%以上。

Conclusion: SimBA框架使得模型开发者在模型训练时提高效率，并帮助数据集创建者验证其新创建的数据集与现有基准数据集的差异。

Abstract: Modern language models are evaluated on large benchmarks, which are difficult
to make sense of, especially for model selection. Looking at the raw evaluation
numbers themselves using a model-centric lens, we propose SimBA, a three phase
framework to Simplify Benchmark Analysis. The three phases of SimBA are: stalk,
where we conduct dataset & model comparisons, prowl, where we discover a
representative subset, and pounce, where we use the representative subset to
predict performance on a held-out set of models. Applying SimBA to three
popular LM benchmarks: HELM, MMLU, and BigBenchLite reveals that across all
three benchmarks, datasets and models relate strongly to one another (stalk).
We develop an representative set discovery algorithm which covers a benchmark
using raw evaluation scores alone. Using our algorithm, we find that with 6.25%
(1/16), 1.7% (1/58), and 28.4% (21/74) of the datasets for HELM, MMLU, and
BigBenchLite respectively, we achieve coverage levels of at least 95% (prowl).
Additionally, using just these representative subsets, we can both preserve
model ranks and predict performance on a held-out set of models with near zero
mean-squared error (pounce). Taken together, SimBA can help model developers
improve efficiency during model training and dataset creators validate whether
their newly created dataset differs from existing datasets in a benchmark. Our
code is open source, available at https://github.com/nishantsubramani/simba.

Result: 该论文探讨了多语言水印技术在大型语言模型（LLM）输出中的可追溯性问题，指出当前技术在中等和低资源语言上缺乏跨语言的鲁棒性。作者提出STEAM，一种基于反向翻译的检测方法，以提高水印在各种语言中的强度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STEAM 方法显著提高了17种语言的水印检测能力，提供了一种简单且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual watermarking aims to make large language model (LLM) outputs
traceable across languages, yet current methods still fall short. Despite
claims of cross-lingual robustness, they are evaluated only on high-resource
languages. We show that existing multilingual watermarking methods are not
truly multilingual: they fail to remain robust under translation attacks in
medium- and low-resource languages. We trace this failure to semantic
clustering, which fails when the tokenizer vocabulary contains too few
full-word tokens for a given language. To address this, we introduce STEAM, a
back-translation-based detection method that restores watermark strength lost
through translation. STEAM is compatible with any watermarking method, robust
across different tokenizers and languages, non-invasive, and easily extendable
to new languages. With average gains of +0.19 AUC and +40%p TPR@1% on 17
languages, STEAM provides a simple and robust path toward fairer watermarking
across diverse languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户行为序列建模中，当语义上下文有限时，LLM的性能通常受到影响，因此需要一种新的框架来自动丰富这些序列。

Method: LaMAR利用LLMs在少量样本设置下，从现有元数据中推断用户意图和物品关系，生成辅助上下文信号，增强原始序列的语义深度。

Result: 通过将LLM生成的上下文信号整合到基准序列建模任务中，LaMAR一贯提高了模型性能，且生成的信号展现出高语义新颖性和多样性，增强了下游模型的表示能力。

Conclusion: LaMAR通过丰富用户行为序列的上下文信息，显著提高了序列建模任务的性能，展示了LLM在训练数据和语言资源生成中的新应用潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing latent semantics and
contextual relationships across diverse modalities. However, in modeling user
behavior from sequential interaction data, performance often suffers when such
semantic context is limited or absent. We introduce LaMAR, a LLM-driven
semantic enrichment framework designed to enrich such sequences automatically.
LaMAR leverages LLMs in a few-shot setting to generate auxiliary contextual
signals by inferring latent semantic aspects of a user's intent and item
relationships from existing metadata. These generated signals, such as inferred
usage scenarios, item intents, or thematic summaries, augment the original
sequences with greater contextual depth. We demonstrate the utility of this
generated resource by integrating it into benchmark sequential modeling tasks,
where it consistently improves performance. Further analysis shows that
LLM-generated signals exhibit high semantic novelty and diversity, enhancing
the representational capacity of the downstream models. This work represents a
new data-centric paradigm where LLMs serve as intelligent context generators,
contributing a new method for the semi-automatic creation of training data and
language resources.

Result: 12个大型语言模型在两个翻译任务中的表现得分，其中最好的模型在首个任务上达到约90%的准确率，在第二个任务上，COMET分数约为92%。

Conclusion: 较优秀的模型通过推理显著提高了翻译准确性，且推理改善与没有推理的模型分数呈正相关。

Abstract: This paper assesses the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to translate
texts that include inter-sentential dependencies. We use the English-French
DiscEvalMT benchmark (Bawden et al., 2018) with pairs of sentences containing
translation challenges either for pronominal anaphora or for lexical cohesion.
We evaluate 12 LLMs from the DeepSeek-R1, GPT, Llama, Mistral and Phi families
on two tasks: (1) distinguishing a correct translation from a wrong but
plausible one; (2) generating a correct translation. We compare prompts that
encourage chain-of-thought reasoning with those that do not. The best models
take advantage of reasoning and reach about 90% accuracy on the first task, and
COMET scores of about 92% on the second task, with GPT-4, GPT-4o and Phi
standing out. Moreover, we observe a "wise get wiser" effect: the improvements
through reasoning are positively correlated with the scores of the models
without reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型中难度编码的稳定性，发现人类标注的难度信号在模型训练中具有更高的一致性，而模型生成的难度信号随着提升而失去相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在解决复杂问题时的表现与简单问题时的失误，并探讨内部编码的难度是否与人类判断一致，以及这一表示是否在后期强化学习中能够跟踪泛化。

Method: 对60个模型进行线性探针训练，评估数学和编码子集的表现，使用Easy2HardBench的数据集。

Result: 人类标注的难度可被强线性可解（AMC: $ho 	ext{约为} 0.88$），且具有明显的模型规模扩展性，而LLM衍生的难度相对较弱，扩展性差；在训练过程中，人与模型生成的难度探针呈现出不同的表现与相关性变化。

Conclusion: 人类标注的难度提供了一个稳定的信号，而模型性能所衍生的自动难度评估随着模型的提升而失去一致性。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a puzzling inconsistency: they solve complex
problems yet frequently fail on seemingly simpler ones. We investigate whether
LLMs internally encode problem difficulty in a way that aligns with human
judgment, and whether this representation tracks generalization during
reinforcement learning post-training. We train linear probes across layers and
token positions on 60 models, evaluating on mathematical and coding subsets of
Easy2HardBench. We find that human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly
decodable (AMC: $\rho \approx 0.88$) and exhibits clear model-size scaling,
whereas LLM-derived difficulty is substantially weaker and scales poorly.
Steering along the difficulty direction reveals that pushing models toward
"easier" representations reduces hallucination and improves accuracy. During
GRPO training on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, the human-difficulty probe strengthens and
positively correlates with test accuracy across training steps, while the
LLM-difficulty probe degrades and negatively correlates with performance. These
results suggest that human annotations provide a stable difficulty signal that
RL amplifies, while automated difficulty estimates derived from model
performance become misaligned precisely as models improve. We release probe
code and evaluation scripts to facilitate replication.

Motivation: 研究模型行为的机制解释，特别是在深度学习和自然语言处理领域，寻求更直观的解释方法。

Method: 开发了一种简单的方法，从Transformer模型中自动提取特征的规则描述，针对GPT-2进行了应用。

Result: 提出了一种基于规则的描述方法，可以自动提取模型特征，提供比传统示例分析更有效的解释。

Conclusion: 本文为通过基于规则的描述来解释模型特征奠定了基础，并展示了如何提取这些规则及其行为的初步分类。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability strives to explain model behavior in terms of
bottom-up primitives. The leading paradigm is to express hidden states as a
sparse linear combination of basis vectors, called features. However, this only
identifies which text sequences (exemplars) activate which features; the actual
interpretation of features requires subjective inspection of these exemplars.
This paper advocates for a different solution: rule-based descriptions that
match token patterns in the input and correspondingly increase or decrease the
likelihood of specific output tokens. Specifically, we extract rule-based
descriptions of SAE features trained on the outputs of attention layers. While
prior work treats the attention layers as an opaque box, we describe how it may
naturally be expressed in terms of interactions between input and output
features, of which we study three types: (1) skip-gram rules of the form
"[Canadian city]... speaks --> English", (2) absence rules of the form
"[Montreal]... speaks -/-> English," and (3) counting rules that toggle only
when the count of a word exceeds a certain value or the count of another word.
Absence and counting rules are not readily discovered by inspection of
exemplars, where manual and automatic descriptions often identify misleading or
incomplete explanations. We then describe a simple approach to extract these
types of rules automatically from a transformer, and apply it to GPT-2 small.
We find that a majority of features may be described well with around 100
skip-gram rules, though absence rules are abundant even as early as the first
layer (in over a fourth of features). We also isolate a few examples of
counting rules. This paper lays the groundwork for future research into
rule-based descriptions of features by defining them, showing how they may be
extracted, and providing a preliminary taxonomy of some of the behaviors they
represent.

Motivation: 提示工程对于从大型语言模型中获得可靠和有效的输出至关重要，但其设计需要专业知识和对目标任务的深入理解。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，根据用户的任务描述自适应选择合适的提示技术，自动生成高质量的提示。

Result: 在BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH)上的23个任务的实验评估表明，该方法的性能优于标准提示和现有的自动提示生成工具，使用算术和调和均值评分进行测量。

Conclusion: 该研究为提示创建的简化和标准化奠定了基础，使非专业人员能够有效使用大型语言模型（LLMs）。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving reliable and effective outputs
from large language models (LLMs), but its design requires specialized
knowledge of prompting techniques and a deep understanding of target tasks. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that adaptively selects
task-appropriate prompting techniques based on users' abstract task
descriptions and automatically generates high-quality prompts without relying
on pre-existing templates or frameworks. The proposed method constructs a
knowledge base that associates task clusters, characterized by semantic
similarity across diverse tasks, with their corresponding prompting techniques.
When users input task descriptions, the system assigns them to the most
relevant task cluster and dynamically generates prompts by integrating
techniques drawn from the knowledge base. An experimental evaluation of the
proposed method on 23 tasks from BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH) demonstrates
superior performance compared with standard prompts and existing automatic
prompt-generation tools, as measured by both arithmetic and harmonic mean
scores. This research establishes a foundation for streamlining and
standardizing prompt creation, enabling non-experts to effectively leverage
LLMs.

Motivation: 推动对LLM在生成时间演变叙述中的推理方式的理解，并提高动态生成表格的效率和可靠性。

Method: 使用来自实时板球评论的动态基准CMT-Bench，设计三种保持语义一致性的维度进行评估。

Result: 在多种长上下文的最先进LLM中，发现无提取摘要时结果大幅下降，输入长度增加时表现单调下降，实体形式变化时准确率一致下降。

Conclusion: 目前的LLM在动态生成文本到表格的任务中表现脆弱，强调需要以稳健性为首要目标对其进行评估，以便开发有效和可扩展的方法。

Abstract: LLM Driven text-to-table (T2T) systems often rely on extensive
prompt-engineering or iterative event extraction in code-parsable formats,
which boosts scores but are computationally expensive and obscure how models
actually reason over temporal evolving narratives to summarise key information.
We present CMT-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark built from live cricket commentary
that requires dynamic table generation across two evolving schemas under a
dense, rule-governed policy. CMT-Bench is designed to probe robustness via
three semantics-preserving dimensions: (i) extractive-cue ablation to separate
extractive shortcuts from state tracking, (ii) temporal prefixing to test
long-context stability, and (iii) entity-form perturbations (anonymization,
outof-distribution substitutions, role-entangling paraphrases) to assess
sensitivity to surface variation. Across diverse long-context stateof-the-art
LLMs, we find large drops without extractive summaries, monotonic degradation
with input length, and consistent accuracy drop under entity-form changes.
Complementary distributional tests confirm significant shifts in numeric error
patterns, indicating drift in reasoning rather than mere noise. Our results
show that current LLMs are brittle in dynamic Textto-table generation,
motivating robustness-first evaluation as a prerequisite for developing
efficient and scalable approaches for this task.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs作为评估者时的可靠性问题，尤其是其在直接评分中的偏差现象。

Method: 提出对比解码方法以缓解LLMs在评分过程中的分数范围偏差。

Result: 通过对比解码，平均提高与人类判断的斯皮尔曼相关性达到11.3%。

Conclusion: 通过对比解码方法，有效减轻了LLMs在评分中的偏差，提高了模型与人类判断之间的相关性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly used as evaluators in various
applications, but the reliability of the outcomes remains a challenge. One such
challenge is using LLMs-as-judges for direct assessment, i.e., assigning scores
from a specified range without any references. We first show that this
challenge stems from LLM judge outputs being associated with score range bias,
i.e., LLM judge outputs are highly sensitive to pre-defined score ranges,
preventing the search for optimal score ranges. We also show that similar
biases exist among models from the same family. We then mitigate this bias
through contrastive decoding, achieving up to 11.3% relative improvement on
average in Spearman correlation with human judgments across different score
ranges.

Conclusion: 通过使用MARCUS工具，可以从叙事中生成可视化的人物弧线，这为理解人物旅程提供了量化的依据，并为后续的研究和应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Character arcs are important theoretical devices employed in literary studies
to understand character journeys, identify tropes across literary genres, and
establish similarities between narratives. This work addresses the novel task
of computationally generating event-centric, relation-based character arcs from
narratives. Providing a quantitative representation for arcs brings tangibility
to a theoretical concept and paves the way for subsequent applications. We
present MARCUS (Modelling Arcs for Understanding Stories), an NLP pipeline that
extracts events, participant characters, implied emotion, and sentiment to
model inter-character relations. MARCUS tracks and aggregates these relations
across the narrative to generate character arcs as graphical plots. We generate
character arcs from two extended fantasy series, Harry Potter and Lord of the
Rings. We evaluate our approach before outlining existing challenges,
suggesting applications of our pipeline, and discussing future work.

Conclusion: DelvePO框架在优化提示方面优于现有的方法，展现了优秀的效果和可迁移性，适用于不同任务。

Abstract: Prompt Optimization has emerged as a crucial approach due to its capabilities
in steering Large Language Models to solve various tasks. However, current
works mainly rely on the random rewriting ability of LLMs, and the optimization
process generally focus on specific influencing factors, which makes it easy to
fall into local optimum. Besides, the performance of the optimized prompt is
often unstable, which limits its transferability in different tasks. To address
the above challenges, we propose $\textbf{DelvePO}$
($\textbf{D}$irection-Guid$\textbf{e}$d Se$\textbf{l}$f-E$\textbf{v}$olving
Framework for Fl$\textbf{e}$xible $\textbf{P}$rompt $\textbf{O}$ptimization), a
task-agnostic framework to optimize prompts in self-evolve manner. In our
framework, we decouple prompts into different components that can be used to
explore the impact that different factors may have on various tasks. On this
basis, we introduce working memory, through which LLMs can alleviate the
deficiencies caused by their own uncertainties and further obtain key insights
to guide the generation of new prompts. Extensive experiments conducted on
different tasks covering various domains for both open- and closed-source LLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and GPT-4o-mini.
Experimental results show that DelvePO consistently outperforms previous SOTA
methods under identical experimental settings, demonstrating its effectiveness
and transferability across different tasks.

Method: 将长文本输入作为单个图像呈现，并直接提供给解码器LLM。

Result: 在RULER和CNN/DailyMail两个基准测试中，验证了文本作为图像的方法显著节省了令牌，通常减少近一半。

Conclusion: 通过将文本作为图像输入，显著减少了解码器LLM所需的令牌数量，同时保持任务性能不变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process
visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question:
can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage
while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text
representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input
compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs
as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to
dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of
input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER
(long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we
demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings
(often nearly half) without degrading task performance.

Result: 本文介绍了盲文在教育和信息获取方面的重要性，特别是在视觉障碍人士的帮助作用。然而，盲文信息处理面临数据稀缺及混合文本环境中的歧义等挑战。为此，作者构建了英文与中文盲文混合数据集（EBMD/CBMD），并提出了一种基于语法树的增强方法，以支持盲文领域的研究。此外，文中介绍了盲文知识驱动的微调方法（BKFT），旨在提高传统微调方法在盲文任务中的表现。通过采用指令微调，BrailleLLM显著提升了盲文翻译、公式到盲文的转换和混合文本翻译的统一性。实验结果表明，BKFT在盲文翻译场景中相较于传统微调取得了显著的性能提升。开放源代码的数据集和方法学为低资源多语种盲文研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 通过构建数据集和提出BKFT方法，本文为低资源盲文研究提供了新的基础。

Abstract: Braille plays a vital role in education and information accessibility for
visually impaired individuals. However, Braille information processing faces
challenges such as data scarcity and ambiguities in mixed-text contexts. We
construct English and Chinese Braille Mixed Datasets (EBMD/CBMD) with
mathematical formulas to support diverse Braille domain research, and propose a
syntax tree-based augmentation method tailored for Braille data. To address the
underperformance of traditional fine-tuning methods in Braille-related tasks,
we investigate Braille Knowledge-Based Fine-Tuning (BKFT), which reduces the
learning difficulty of Braille contextual features. BrailleLLM employs BKFT via
instruction tuning to achieve unified Braille translation, formula-to-Braille
conversion, and mixed-text translation. Experiments demonstrate that BKFT
achieves significant performance improvements over conventional fine-tuning in
Braille translation scenarios. Our open-sourced datasets and methodologies
establish a foundation for low-resource multilingual Braille research.

Motivation: 现有的方法在医学问答中由于噪声和不完整的知识检索或者生成的不准确性面临挑战，因此需要一个新的框架来提升问答的可靠性。

Method: MedRGAG框架包括两个关键模块：知识引导的上下文补全(KGCC)和知识感知的文档选择(KADS)，实现对检索知识的补充和优化文档组合。

Result: MedRGAG框架在五个医学问答基准上实现了12.5%的提升，相较MedRAG和4.5%的提升相较MedGENIE，显示了统一检索和生成的有效性。

Conclusion: MedRGAG通过将外部知识和参数知识无缝集成，显著提高了医学问答系统的表现和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) requires extensive access to domain-specific
knowledge. A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs)
with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge
stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two
categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning
on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG),
which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual
documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while
GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to
unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine
answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified
retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external
and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:
Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to
produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by
retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively
selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form
concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments
on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%
improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the
effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive
reasoning. Our code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 域特定适应通过微调和RAG能够实现与专有模型竞争的表现，支持隐私保护的本地可部署临床解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-adapted open-weight large language models (LLMs) offer promising
healthcare applications, from queryable knowledge bases to multimodal
assistants, with the crucial advantage of local deployment for privacy
preservation. However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies,
and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized.
We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of
cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific
literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing
finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7
as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved
superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics,
ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert
evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned
models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all
evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity
across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity.
Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves
competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of
privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.

TL;DR: HYDRE框架通过动态实例检索和大语言模型结合来提升远程监督关系提取的准确性，特别是在低资源语言中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对现有DSRE模型在处理噪声标注时关系语义学习不准确的问题，并希望结合大语言模型发挥更大效能。

Method: HYDRE框架包括一个先通过DSRE模型识别潜在关系，再利用动态示例检索策略从训练数据中提取可靠实例的两步过程。

Result: 提出了一种新的HYDRE框架，以改进远程监督关系提取（DSRE）任务，解决现有模型在噪声数据标注下的性能问题。

Conclusion: HYDRE在多个语言的关系提取任务上取得了显著提升，特别是在低资源语言中相较于以往方法表现更为优秀。

Abstract: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) remains a long-standing
challenge in NLP, where models must learn from noisy bag-level annotations
while making sentence-level predictions. While existing state-of-the-art (SoTA)
DSRE models rely on task-specific training, their integration with in-context
learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs) remains underexplored. A key
challenge is that the LLM may not learn relation semantics correctly, due to
noisy annotation.
  In response, we propose HYDRE -- HYbrid Distantly Supervised Relation
Extraction framework. It first uses a trained DSRE model to identify the top-k
candidate relations for a given test sentence, then uses a novel dynamic
exemplar retrieval strategy that extracts reliable, sentence-level exemplars
from training data, which are then provided in LLM prompt for outputting the
final relation(s).
  We further extend HYDRE to cross-lingual settings for RE in low-resource
languages. Using available English DSRE training data, we evaluate all methods
on English as well as a newly curated benchmark covering four diverse
low-resource Indic languages -- Oriya, Santali, Manipuri, and Tulu. HYDRE
achieves up to 20 F1 point gains in English and, on average, 17 F1 points on
Indic languages over prior SoTA DSRE models. Detailed ablations exhibit HYDRE's

TL;DR: KoSimpleQA是针对大语言模型的一个评估基准，显示了其在处理韩国文化问题时的表现不佳，并强调推理在问答任务中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估大型语言模型在韩国文化知识领域的准确性，并提供一个有挑战性且易于评分的问答基准。

Method: 通过设计1,000个短小且明确的问题，对多种开放源代码的语言模型进行全面评估。

Result: 当前最强模型的回答正确率仅为33.7%，且在KoSimpleQA上的性能排名与英语版本存在显著差异。

Conclusion: KoSimpleQA是一个有效的基准，显示了当前大型语言模型在处理韩国文化知识方面的局限性，并强调了推理能力在问答任务中的重要性。

Abstract: We present $\textbf{Korean SimpleQA (KoSimpleQA)}$, a benchmark for
evaluating factuality in large language models (LLMs) with a focus on Korean
cultural knowledge. KoSimpleQA is designed to be challenging yet easy to grade,
consisting of 1,000 short, fact-seeking questions with unambiguous answers. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of open-source LLMs of
varying sizes that support Korean, and find that even the strongest model
generates correct answer only 33.7% of the time, underscoring the challenging
nature of KoSimpleQA. Notably, performance rankings on KoSimpleQA differ
substantially from those on the English SimpleQA, highlighting the unique value
of our dataset. Furthermore, our analysis of reasoning LLMs shows that engaging
reasoning capabilities in the factual QA task can both help models better
elicit their latent knowledge and improve their ability to abstain when
uncertain. KoSimpleQA can be found at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究聚焦于为第二语言使用者建立公平的英语语音识别系统，提出通过轻量适配器结合谱解耦和分布鲁棒优化的方法以减小不同口音组间的公平性差距，并显著提高了识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究的动机是解决现有ASR模型在处理第二语言使用者时存在的公平性差距，以更好地服务于不同口音的用户。

Method: 采用公平性引导的微调，结合谱解耦、组分布鲁棒优化和不变风险最小化，针对不同口音组的公平性进行了优化。

Result: 本研究针对为第二语言使用者构建公平的英语语音识别（ASR）系统所面临的挑战。我们分析了被广泛使用的ASR模型Whisper和Seamless-M4T，发现26个口音组之间的字错误率（WER）波动很大，表明存在显著的公平性差距。为此，我们提出了使用轻量级适配器的公平性引导微调方法，结合谱解耦（SD）、组分布鲁棒优化（Group-DRO）和不变风险最小化（IRM）。我们将传统经验风险最小化（ERM）与交叉熵和公平性驱动目标（SD、Group DRO和IRM）相结合，增强了各个口音组之间的公平性，同时保持了整体识别准确性。在宏平均字错误率方面，我们的方法在大规模预训练的Whisper和Seamless-M4T上实现了58.7%和58.5%的相对改进，相较于使用标准经验风险最小化和交叉熵损失的微调分别提高了9.7%和7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过介绍轻量适配器和公平性引导微调，该研究有效地缩小了ASR系统在不同口音组之间的公平性差距，同时提升了识别准确率。

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of building fair English ASR systems
for second-language speakers. Our analysis of widely used ASR models, Whisper
and Seamless-M4T, reveals large fluctuations in word error rate (WER) across 26
accent groups, indicating significant fairness gaps. To mitigate this, we
propose fairness-prompted finetuning with lightweight adapters, incorporating
Spectral Decoupling (SD), Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
(Group-DRO), and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM). Our proposed fusion of
traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy and
fairness-driven objectives (SD, Group DRO, and IRM) enhances fairness across
accent groups while maintaining overall recognition accuracy. In terms of
macro-averaged word error rate, our approach achieves a relative improvement of
58.7% and 58.5% over the large pretrained Whisper and SeamlessM4T, and 9.7% and
7.8% over them, finetuning with standard empirical risk minimization with
cross-entropy loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MENTOR框架，结合RL与教师指导蒸馏，解决SFT和稀疏奖励RL的局限性，提升小语言模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效地将大型语言模型(LLMs)的工具使用能力蒸馏到更小、更高效的小语言模型(SLMs)中，以应对当前方法在泛化能力上的不足。

Method: 通过将强化学习(RL)与教师指导蒸馏相结合，MENTOR框架学习更具泛化能力的策略，并通过教师参考轨迹构建稠密复合奖励。

Result: MENTOR有效解决了稀疏奖励带来的指导不足问题，提高了小语言模型的表现。

Conclusion: MENTOR框架显著提高了小语言模型(SLMs)的跨域泛化能力和策略能力，相比于传统的监督微调(SFT)和稀疏奖励强化学习(RL)基线表现更佳。

Abstract: Distilling the tool-using capabilities of large language models (LLMs) into
smaller, more efficient small language models (SLMs) is a key challenge for
their practical application. The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static
set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While
reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse
rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with
inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these
distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically
combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation,
MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through
exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a
teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided
reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and
strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL
baselines.

*Siyuan Yan,Guo-Qing Jiang,Yuchen Zhang,Xiaoxing Ma,Ran Zhu,Chun Cao,Jingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Adamas，一种高效的稀疏注意力机制，能优化长上下文推理，达到高准确性并显著降低计算延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于长上下文引发的自注意力计算成本激增，本文旨在引入高效的稀疏注意力机制，以解决准确性下降的问题。

Method: 本文采用Hadamard变换、桶化和2位压缩等技术进行稀疏表示，同时利用曼哈顿距离估计进行高效的top-k选择。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为Adamas的轻量级稀疏注意力机制，旨在优化长上下文推理中的自注意力计算效率。与现有稀疏注意力方法相比，Adamas采用了Hadamard变换、桶化和2位压缩技术，能够在保持高准确率的同时，大幅减小计算量和延迟。实验结果表明，Adamas在仅使用64个标记的预算情况下，其准确性可与全注意力匹敌，并且在128个标记时表现近乎无损。在可支持高达8倍稀疏性的情况下，Adamas在长度达到32K的序列上，呈现出高达4.4倍的自注意力加速和1.5倍的端到端速度提升。此外，其困惑度表现与全注意力相当或更低，显示出在高稀疏情况下保持准确性的有效性。

Conclusion: Adamas机制在保障准确性的同时，极大提升了注意力计算的效率，适用于长文档处理和其它相关应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now support context windows of hundreds of
thousands to millions of tokens, enabling applications such as long-document
summarization, large-scale code synthesis, multi-document question answering
and persistent multi-turn dialogue. However, such extended contexts exacerbate
the quadratic cost of self-attention, leading to severe latency in
autoregressive decoding. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate these
costs but rely on heuristic patterns that struggle to recall critical key-value
(KV) pairs for each query, resulting in accuracy degradation. We introduce
Adamas, a lightweight yet highly accurate sparse attention mechanism designed
for long-context inference. Adamas applies the Hadamard transform,
bucketization and 2-bit compression to produce compact representations, and
leverages Manhattan-distance estimation for efficient top-k selections.
Experiments show that Adamas matches the accuracy of full attention with only a
64-token budget, achieves near-lossless performance at 128, and supports up to
8x higher sparsity than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while delivering
up to 4.4x self-attention and 1.5x end-to-end speedups on 32K-length sequences.
Remarkably, Adamas attains comparable or even lower perplexity than full
attention, underscoring its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy under
aggressive sparsity.

TL;DR: 本文提出的CoCT范式提升了LLM在开放域任务中的表现，尤其在情感支持对话中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的Chain-of-Thought方法在开放域任务中的应用效果有限，因此提出CoCT以增强LLM的深度和战略思维。

Method: 通过提示基础的方法，CoCT让LLM先标记概念，再深入生成内容。

Result: 本研究提出了一种新的提示基础范式"概念思想链（CoCT）"，旨在改善大型语言模型（LLM）在开放域任务中的性能。通过让LLM首先标记概念，然后生成详细内容，CoCT在日常和情感支持对话中表现出卓越的效果。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，CoCT超越了多种基线方法，展示了其在更广泛任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is widely applied to improve the LLM capability in
math, coding and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is limited for
open-domain tasks since there are no clearly defined reasoning steps or logical
transitions. To mitigate such challenges, we propose another prompt-based
paradigm called Chain of Conceptual Thought (CoCT), where the LLM first tags a
concept, then generates the detailed content. The chain of concepts is allowed
within the utterance, encouraging the LLM's deep and strategic thinking. We
experiment with this paradigm in daily and emotional support conversations
where the concept is comprised of emotions, strategies and topics. Automatic,
human and model evaluations suggest that CoCT surpasses baselines such as
Self-Refine, ECoT, ToT, SoT and RAG, suggesting a potential effective
prompt-based paradigm of LLM for a wider scope of tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种标记级别的可靠性测量方法，以量化视觉信息在手语翻译模型中的应用，帮助识别幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨手语翻译中的幻觉问题，尤其是无中介监督的模型在生成准确翻译方面的脆弱性。

Method: 结合特征敏感性与反事实信号，量化视觉输入对解码器的影响，最终形成句子级别的可靠性评分。

Result: 该方法在两个手语翻译基准上进行评估，结果表明其能够预测幻觉率并在视觉退化情况下可靠性降低，且可区分真实和猜测的标记。

Conclusion: 提出的可靠性测量方法有效预测幻觉率，并在不同数据集和架构中具有普适性，为多模态生成中的幻觉检测奠定基础。

Abstract: Hallucination, where models generate fluent text unsupported by visual
evidence, remains a major flaw in vision-language models and is particularly
critical in sign language translation (SLT). In SLT, meaning depends on precise
grounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because
they map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without
intermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that
hallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual
input. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that
quantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines
feature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is
masked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences
between clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a
sentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure
of visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks
(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our
results show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across
datasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond
these quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded
tokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when
combined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it
further improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights
why gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations. Taken together,
our findings establish reliability as a practical and reusable tool for
diagnosing hallucinations in SLT, and lay the groundwork for more robust
hallucination detection in multimodal generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在创造性写作和内容生成中的使用带来的安全隐患，特别是在幽默生成的上下文中。

Method: 通过对六种模型的幽默、刻板印象和毒性进行联合评测，并结合信息论指标分析不一致信号。

Result: 研究表明，有害输出获得更高的幽默评分，且在角色提示下更为明显，这导致生成器与评估器之间的偏见放大循环。

Conclusion: 外部验证表明，使用大语言模型生成的讽刺不仅增加了刻板印象和毒性，且某些模型的有害段子反而被认为更具幽默感。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for creative writing and
engagement content, raising safety concerns about the outputs. Therefore,
casting humor generation as a testbed, this work evaluates how funniness
optimization in modern LLM pipelines couples with harmful content by jointly
measuring humor, stereotypicality, and toxicity. This is further supplemented
by analyzing incongruity signals through information-theoretic metrics. Across
six models, we observe that harmful outputs receive higher humor scores which
further increase under role-based prompting, indicating a bias amplification
loop between generators and evaluators. Information-theoretic analyses show
harmful cues widen predictive uncertainty and surprisingly, can even make
harmful punchlines more expected for some models, suggesting structural
embedding in learned humor distributions. External validation on an additional
satire-generation task with human perceived funniness judgments shows that LLM
satire increases stereotypicality and typically toxicity, including for closed
models. Quantitatively, stereotypical/toxic jokes gain $10-21\%$ in mean humor
score, stereotypical jokes appear $11\%$ to $28\%$ more often among the jokes
marked funny by LLM-based metric and up to $10\%$ more often in generations
perceived as funny by humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速发展的在线游戏领域，缺乏专门的基准测试影响了RAG系统的标准化评估。

Method: ChronoPlay利用双动态更新机制和双源合成引擎，自动生成与玩家社区相关的真实问题。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏中实例化了ChronoPlay框架，创建了第一个动态RAG基准。

Conclusion: ChronoPlay框架为游戏领域的动态RAG基准提供了新的视角，能够在复杂条件下更好地分析模型表现。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in
dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has
impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual
Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting
focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a
benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to
ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge,
we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous
generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update
mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine
that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual
correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three
distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain,
offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic
conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.

Motivation: 归因 Transformer 模型的行为给内部计算的挑战是机械解释性的关键问题，因此需要一个有效的特征归因框架。

Method: DePass 通过对隐藏状态进行自定义加法组件的分解，并在固定注意力得分和 MLP 活动的情况下进行传播。

Result: DePass 在多个归因任务中（包括 token 级别、模型组件级别和子空间级别）验证了其有效性和忠实性，展示了能够归因 Transformer 模型任意组件之间信息流的潜力。

Conclusion: DePass 是一个有效的统一特征归因框架，能够在不需要辅助训练的情况下，实现精确的特征归因，促进对 Transformer 模型内部计算的理解。

Abstract: Attributing the behavior of Transformer models to internal computations is a
central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. We introduce DePass, a
unified framework for feature attribution based on a single decomposed forward
pass. DePass decomposes hidden states into customized additive components, then
propagates them with attention scores and MLP's activations fixed. It achieves
faithful, fine-grained attribution without requiring auxiliary training. We
validate DePass across token-level, model component-level, and subspace-level
attribution tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and fidelity. Our
experiments highlight its potential to attribute information flow between
arbitrary components of a Transformer model. We hope DePass serves as a
foundational tool for broader applications in interpretability.

Result: 提出了一种使用大语言模型将WordNet与CEFR进行注释的方法，并验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的注释WordNet、语料库和分类器将为语言教育和自然语言处理的结合提供实用工具，提升语言学习的效果和效率。

Abstract: Although WordNet is a valuable resource owing to its structured semantic
networks and extensive vocabulary, its fine-grained sense distinctions can be
challenging for second-language learners. To address this, we developed a
WordNet annotated with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages
(CEFR), integrating its semantic networks with language-proficiency levels. We
automated this process using a large language model to measure the semantic
similarity between sense definitions in WordNet and entries in the English
Vocabulary Profile Online. To validate our method, we constructed a large-scale
corpus containing both sense and CEFR-level information from our annotated
WordNet and used it to develop contextual lexical classifiers. Our experiments
demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our corpus perform comparably to those
trained on gold-standard annotations. Furthermore, by combining our corpus with
the gold-standard data, we developed a practical classifier that achieves a
Macro-F1 score of 0.81, indicating the high accuracy of our annotations. Our
annotated WordNet, corpus, and classifiers are publicly available to help
bridge the gap between natural language processing and language education,
thereby facilitating more effective and efficient language learning.

Method: 利用大型语言模型和领域特定的微调对IMB-QA和IMB-MCQA数据集进行实验，比较了不同的LLM架构在开放式和选择题问答任务中的表现。

Result: 介绍了两个意大利医疗基准数据集：IMB-QA和IMB-MCQA，并展示了如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提高医疗论坛数据的清晰度和一致性，同时保持其原意和对话风格。

Conclusion: 专门的适应策略能够在医疗问答任务中优于更大的一般模型；有效的医疗AI系统可能更依赖于领域专业知识和信息检索，而非仅仅模型规模的增加。

Abstract: Online medical forums have long served as vital platforms where patients seek
professional healthcare advice, generating vast amounts of valuable knowledge.
However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions
pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems,
especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two
comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644
patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \textbf{IMB-MCQA},
comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty
examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged
to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining
their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM
architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our
experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific
fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform
larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These
findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain
expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.
We release both datasets and evaluation frameworks in our GitHub repository to
support further research on multilingual medical question answering:

Motivation: 针对现有药物知识提取研究主要集中于英语语料库的局限，尤其是缺乏适应其他医疗体系的资源，提出DART以填补这一空白。

Method: 通过可重复的管道构建DART数据集，涵盖文档检索、监管部分的语义分割，以及基于少量示例调整的大型语言模型进行临床摘要。

Result: DART提供了关于药物指征、不良反应和药物间相互作用的结构化信息，并通过基于LLM的药物相互作用检查器进行了有效性验证。

Conclusion: DART数据集展示了如何利用结构化信息来提升药物相互作用的推断能力，并证明了指令调优的语言模型在临床决策支持中的有效性。

Abstract: The extraction of pharmacological knowledge from regulatory documents has
become a key focus in biomedical natural language processing, with applications
ranging from adverse event monitoring to AI-assisted clinical decision support.
However, research in this field has predominantly relied on English-language
corpora such as DrugBank, leaving a significant gap in resources tailored to
other healthcare systems. To address this limitation, we introduce DART (Drug
Annotation from Regulatory Texts), the first structured corpus of Italian
Summaries of Product Characteristics derived from the official repository of
the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA). The dataset was built through a
reproducible pipeline encompassing web-scale document retrieval, semantic
segmentation of regulatory sections, and clinical summarization using a
few-shot-tuned large language model with low-temperature decoding. DART
provides structured information on key pharmacological domains such as
indications, adverse drug reactions, and drug-drug interactions. To validate
its utility, we implemented an LLM-based drug interaction checker that
leverages the dataset to infer clinically meaningful interactions. Experimental
results show that instruction-tuned LLMs can accurately infer potential
interactions and their clinical implications when grounded in the structured
textual fields of DART. We publicly release our code on GitHub:

Motivation: 探讨扩散语言模型的效率问题及其与自回归模型的性能差异，以改善其在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 通过实证基准测试和基于屋脊线的理论分析，对扩散语言模型的效率进行系统研究。

Result: 扩散语言模型在大多数情况下的吞吐量低于自回归模型，且加速策略在小批量时效果明显，随着规模扩大效果下降。

Conclusion: 研究发现，尽管扩散语言模型在解码效率方面具有潜力，但在速度表现上仍落后于自回归模型，需要改进评估方法和加速策略。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
the long-dominant autoregressive (AR) paradigm, offering a parallelable
decoding process that could yield greater efficiency. Yet, in practice, current
open-source DLMs often underperform their AR counterparts in speed, limiting
their real-world utility. This work presents a systematic study of DLM
efficiency, identifying key issues in prior evaluation methods. Through
empirical benchmarking and a roofline-based theoretical analysis, we
demonstrate that AR models generally achieve higher throughput, while DLMs
consistently lag. We also investigate acceleration strategies, finding that
techniques like dual cache and parallel decoding mainly offer gains at small
batch sizes, with their benefits diminishing upon scaling. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust evaluation methods and improved acceleration
strategies to advance research on DLMs.

TL;DR: 大型语言模型缺乏文化推理能力，导致表现出对少数群体的偏见，需将文化推理作为基本能力来提升AI的文化敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决当前大型语言模型在文化认知上的缺陷，以提升其对全球用户的适应性和敏感性。

Method: 本研究通过评估现有模型在文化推理方面的不足，提出了对文化推理概念的明确界定，并分析了其评价方法的局限性。

Result: 本研究强调了大型语言模型在自然语言处理中的局限性，特别是在文化推理能力上的不足。这种能力使模型能够识别特定文化的知识、价值观和社会规范，并调整其输出以符合不同用户的期望。研究表明，当前模型常常默认西方规范，缺乏对多元文化的理解，可能导致刻板印象和对少数群体观点的忽视。

Conclusion: 文化推理应作为AI的重要能力，与事实准确性和语言连贯性并重，以期提高模型对人类文化复杂性的响应能力。

Abstract: Large language models have become the latest trend in natural language
processing, heavily featuring in the digital tools we use every day. However,
their replies often reflect a narrow cultural viewpoint that overlooks the
diversity of global users. This missing capability could be referred to as
cultural reasoning, which we define here as the capacity of a model to
recognise culture-specific knowledge values and social norms, and to adjust its
output so that it aligns with the expectations of individual users. Because
culture shapes interpretation, emotional resonance, and acceptable behaviour,
cultural reasoning is essential for identity-aware AI. When this capacity is
limited or absent, models can sustain stereotypes, ignore minority
perspectives, erode trust, and perpetuate hate. Recent empirical studies
strongly suggest that current models default to Western norms when judging
moral dilemmas, interpreting idioms, or offering advice, and that fine-tuning
on survey data only partly reduces this tendency. The present evaluation
methods mainly report static accuracy scores and thus fail to capture adaptive
reasoning in context. Although broader datasets can help, they cannot alone
ensure genuine cultural competence. Therefore, we argue that cultural reasoning
must be treated as a foundational capability alongside factual accuracy and
linguistic coherence. By clarifying the concept and outlining initial
directions for its assessment, a foundation is laid for future systems to be
able to respond with greater sensitivity to the complex fabric of human
culture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健中使用大语言模型的潜力受到数据特征影响的驱动，尤其是偏见问题亟需解决。

Method: 通过建立HC4数据集，并结合一般标准与医疗特定方法进行评估。

Result: 提出了HC4数据集，及其评估结果为临床AI应用提供了重要见解，促进公平性和安全性。

Conclusion: 研究提示了临床语言模型中潜在的偏见，强调了公平性和安全性的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models offer transformative potential for healthcare, yet
their responsible and equitable development depends critically on a deeper
understanding of how training data characteristics influence model behavior,
including the potential for bias. Current practices in dataset curation and
bias assessment often lack the necessary transparency, creating an urgent need
for comprehensive evaluation frameworks to foster trust and guide improvements.
In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of potential downstream biases
in clinical language models, with a focus on differential opioid prescription
tendencies across diverse demographic groups, such as ethnicity, gender, and
age. As part of this investigation, we introduce HC4: Healthcare Comprehensive
Commons Corpus, a novel and extensively curated pretraining dataset exceeding
89 billion tokens. Our evaluation leverages both established general benchmarks
and a novel, healthcare-specific methodology, offering crucial insights to
support fairness and safety in clinical AI applications.

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建一个理论驱动的双语数据集，填补了当前数字非人化研究中的空白，并提供了有效的训练资源和基准。

Abstract: Digital dehumanization, although a critical issue, remains largely overlooked
within the field of computational linguistics and Natural Language Processing.
The prevailing approach in current research concentrating primarily on a single
aspect of dehumanization that identifies overtly negative statements as its
core marker. This focus, while crucial for understanding harmful online
communications, inadequately addresses the broader spectrum of dehumanization.
Specifically, it overlooks the subtler forms of dehumanization that, despite
not being overtly offensive, still perpetuate harmful biases against
marginalized groups in online interactions. These subtler forms can insidiously
reinforce negative stereotypes and biases without explicit offensiveness,
making them harder to detect yet equally damaging. Recognizing this gap, we use
different sampling methods to collect a theory-informed bilingual dataset from
Twitter and Reddit. Using crowdworkers and experts to annotate 16,000 instances
on a document- and span-level, we show that our dataset covers the different
dimensions of dehumanization. This dataset serves as both a training resource
for machine learning models and a benchmark for evaluating future
dehumanization detection techniques. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we
fine-tune ML models on this dataset, achieving performance that surpasses
state-of-the-art models in zero and few-shot in-context settings.

Motivation: 探索使用超声影像作为评估言语运动动态模型的新方法

Method: 评估线性谐振子的参数

Result: 超声和电磁成像获得的动态参数具有可比性，且下颌短肌腱跟踪能够有效捕捉下颌运动。

Conclusion: 结果支持将超声运动学用于评估动态发音模型的有效性。

Abstract: The control of speech can be modelled as a dynamical system in which
articulators are driven toward target positions. These models are typically
evaluated using fleshpoint data, such as electromagnetic articulography (EMA),
but recent methodological advances make ultrasound imaging a promising
alternative. We evaluate whether the parameters of a linear harmonic oscillator
can be reliably estimated from ultrasound tongue kinematics and compare these
with parameters estimated from simultaneously-recorded EMA data. We find that
ultrasound and EMA yield comparable dynamical parameters, while mandibular
short tendon tracking also adequately captures jaw motion. This supports using
ultrasound kinematics to evaluate dynamical articulatory models.

Abstract: Multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains a challenging task,
especially when balancing performance across high- and low-resource languages.
Recent advances in sequence modeling suggest that architectures beyond
Transformers may offer better scalability and efficiency. In this work, we
introduce MLMA (Multilingual Language Modeling with Mamba for ASR), a new
approach that leverages the Mamba architecture--an efficient state-space model
optimized for long-context sequence processing--for multilingual ASR. Using
Mamba, MLMA implicitly incorporates language-aware conditioning and shared
representations to support robust recognition across diverse languages.
Experiments on standard multilingual benchmarks show that MLMA achieves
competitive performance compared to Transformer-based architectures. These
results highlight Mamba's potential as a strong backbone for scalable,
efficient, and accurate multilingual speech recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模语音模型在处理语言切换时的适应性问题，以及避免模型过拟合和丧失基本能力。

Method: 探索贝叶斯分解适配器，针对大规模语音基础模型进行适应性调整。

Result: 在应用于Whisper模型的多语言代码切换场景中，实现了最小适应性损失，同时显著减少了基本模型的灾难性遗忘。与LoRA相比，取得了54%的向后增益，仅在新领域下降了4%。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯适应方法在微调语音基础模型时有效，未牺牲模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large speech foundation models achieve strong performance across many
domains, but they often require adaptation to handle local needs such as
code-switching, where speakers mix languages within the same utterance. Direct
fine-tuning of these models risks overfitting to the target domain and
overwriting the broad capabilities of the base model. To address this
challenge, we explore Bayesian factorized adapters for speech foundation
models, which place priors near zero to achieve sparser adaptation matrices and
thereby retain general performance while adapting to specific domains. We apply
our approach to the Whisper model and evaluate on different multilingual
code-switching scenarios. Our results show only minimal adaptation loss while
significantly reducing catastrophic forgetting of the base model. Compared to
LoRA, our method achieves a backward gain of 54% with only a 4% drop on the new
domain. These findings highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian adaptation for
fine-tuning speech foundation models without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: 针对大型基础模型在代码切换测试中的表现不足，提出了一种利用语言嵌入差异来强化学习的方式，从而提高模型在代码切换场景中的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型在标准基准测试中取得了显著成果，但在代码切换测试案例中表现不佳。数据稀缺无法作为性能不佳的常用理由，因此问题可能出在代码切换时刻的稀少出现。

Method: 提供标签来辅助训练，并利用嵌入语言与主语言的差异来识别和强调代码切换点，减轻生成过程中的上下文偏见。

Result: 通过利用嵌入语言和主要语言之间的差异，模型能够更准确地预测代码切换点，从而减少替代错误，提升鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过在阿拉伯语和中英混合的实验中，模型在更加准确预测代码切换位置方面表现优异，错误率降低。

Abstract: Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large
foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data
scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the
reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the
embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the
models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to
provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on
code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points
where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis
emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation,
we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to
highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those
locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context
bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby
improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and
Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places
more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.

Motivation: 本研究旨在降低高质量领域适应和微调的进入门槛，以支持在资源贫乏的语言领域（如爱尔兰语翻译）进行研究与应用。

Method: 通过引入小型可训练适配层，SemiAdapt和SemiLoRA实现了对大规模多语种模型的参数高效微调，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中展现出优势。

Result: 本研究提出了SemiAdapt和SemiLoRA两种半监督推理高效的参数高效微调方法，旨在增强领域适应性并提升神经机器翻译（NMT）的整体性能，尤其是在资源匮乏的语言翻译任务中。研究表明，SemiAdapt可以超越完整领域的微调，而SemiLoRA则可以使参数高效微调方法达到甚至超越全模型微调的性能。此外，研究还评估了按数据集进行的领域微调，并展示了嵌入基础的推理方法在较大且更嘈杂的语料库上表现良好。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SemiAdapt和SemiLoRA方法能够在低资源语言领域提升翻译模型的性能，推动高质量领域适应和微调的可及性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning is widely used to tailor large language models for specific tasks
such as neural machine translation (NMT). However, leveraging transfer learning
is computationally expensive when fine-tuning large multilingual models with
billions of parameters, thus creating a barrier to entry for researchers
working on low-resource domains such as Irish translation. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) bridges this gap by training on a fraction of the original
model parameters, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach introducing
small, trainable adapter layers. We introduce SemiAdapt and SemiLoRA as
semi-supervised inference-efficient approaches that strengthen domain
adaptation and lead to improved overall performance in NMT. We demonstrate that
SemiAdapt can outperform full-domain fine-tuning, while most notably, SemiLoRA
can propel PEFT methods to match or even outperform full-model fine-tuning. We
further evaluate domain-by-dataset fine-tuning and demonstrate that our
embedding-based inference methods perform especially well on larger and noisier
corpora. All Irish translation models developed in this work are released as
open resources. These methods aim to make high-quality domain adaptation and
fine-tuning more accessible to researchers working with low-resource languages.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在多轮对话中存在的逐渐丧失性能的问题，提升其判断问题可解性的能力。

Method: 采用一种基于能力分级的课程强化学习方法，通过逐步增加对话难度，同时利用混合奖励系统来减少过早回答行为。

Result: RLAAR在LiC基准测试中将性能下降从62.6%减轻到75.1%，同时将有信息弃权率从33.5%提升到73.4%。

Conclusion: RLAAR显著减轻了大型语言模型在多轮对话中的性能下降，并提高了模型的有信息弃权率，为构建可靠的多轮对话LLMs提供了一种实用的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong capabilities in single-turn
instruction following but suffer from Lost-in-Conversation (LiC), a degradation
in performance as information is revealed progressively in multi-turn settings.
Motivated by the current progress on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR), we propose Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Accuracy and Abstention Rewards (RLAAR), a framework that encourages models not
only to generate correct answers, but also to judge the solvability of
questions in the multi-turn conversation setting. Our approach employs a
competence-gated curriculum that incrementally increases dialogue difficulty
(in terms of instruction shards), stabilizing training while promoting
reliability. Using multi-turn, on-policy rollouts and a mixed-reward system,
RLAAR teaches models to balance problem-solving with informed abstention,
reducing premature answering behaviors that cause LiC. Evaluated on LiC
benchmarks, RLAAR significantly mitigates LiC performance decay (62.6% to
75.1%) and improves calibrated abstention rates (33.5% to 73.4%). Together,
these results provide a practical recipe for building multi-turn reliable and
trustworthy LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨人工智能在已发布报纸文章中的实际使用程度，填补现有文献中的空白。

Method: 对2025年夏季发布的1.86万篇来自1500家美国报纸的在线文章进行审计，使用先进的AI检测工具Pangram。

Result: 发现约9%的新发布文章是部分或完全基于人工智能生成，且在不同规模的报纸、小型地方媒体和特定主题中分布不均。社论类型文章中AI生成内容的比例更高，但相关的透明度极低。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了在新闻行业中对人工智能使用的透明性与更新编辑标准的迫切需求，以维持公众信任。

Abstract: AI is rapidly transforming journalism, but the extent of its use in published
newspaper articles remains unclear. We address this gap by auditing a
large-scale dataset of 186K articles from online editions of 1.5K American
newspapers published in the summer of 2025. Using Pangram, a state-of-the-art
AI detector, we discover that approximately 9% of newly-published articles are
either partially or fully AI-generated. This AI use is unevenly distributed,
appearing more frequently in smaller, local outlets, in specific topics such as
weather and technology, and within certain ownership groups. We also analyze
45K opinion pieces from Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street
Journal, finding that they are 6.4 times more likely to contain AI-generated
content than news articles from the same publications, with many AI-flagged
op-eds authored by prominent public figures. Despite this prevalence, we find
that AI use is rarely disclosed: a manual audit of 100 AI-flagged articles
found only five disclosures of AI use. Overall, our audit highlights the
immediate need for greater transparency and updated editorial standards
regarding the use of AI in journalism to maintain public trust.

Conclusion: 微调后的SLM在使用CoT推理后显著超越基础模型，缩小了与LLM的差距。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in specialized
fields, such as industrial applications, due to their efficiency, lower
computational requirements, and ability to be fine-tuned for domain-specific
tasks, enabling accurate and cost-effective solutions. However, performing
complex reasoning using SLMs in specialized fields such as Industry 4.0 remains
challenging. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework for
industrial asset health, which transfers reasoning capabilities via
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
smaller, more efficient models (SLMs). We discuss the advantages and the
process of distilling LLMs using multi-choice question answering (MCQA) prompts
to enhance reasoning and refine decision-making. We also perform in-context
learning to verify the quality of the generated knowledge and benchmark the
performance of fine-tuned SLMs with generated knowledge against widely used
LLMs. The results show that the fine-tuned SLMs with CoT reasoning outperform
the base models by a significant margin, narrowing the gap to their LLM
counterparts. Our code is open-sourced at:

Motivation: 由于当前动态稀疏注意力模型在超长上下文的训练中面临计算不平衡和通信开销的问题，因此需要一种高效的训练方法。

Method: 提出一个新的分布式训练方法MTraining，利用动态稀疏注意力机制。

Result: 通过在32个A100 GPU集群上训练Qwen2.5-3B，将其上下文窗口从32K扩展到512K tokens，MTraining加强了训练吞吐量，达到了6倍提升，同时保持了模型的准确性。

Conclusion: MTraining显著提高了超长上下文的训练效率，并保持了模型的准确性。

Abstract: The adoption of long context windows has become a standard feature in Large
Language Models (LLMs), as extended contexts significantly enhance their
capacity for complex reasoning and broaden their applicability across diverse
scenarios. Dynamic sparse attention is a promising approach for reducing the
computational cost of long-context. However, efficiently training LLMs with
dynamic sparse attention on ultra-long contexts-especially in distributed
settings-remains a significant challenge, due in large part to worker- and
step-level imbalance. This paper introduces MTraining, a novel distributed
methodology leveraging dynamic sparse attention to enable efficient training
for LLMs with ultra-long contexts. Specifically, MTraining integrates three key
components: a dynamic sparse training pattern, balanced sparse ring attention,
and hierarchical sparse ring attention. These components are designed to
synergistically address the computational imbalance and communication overheads
inherent in dynamic sparse attention mechanisms during the training of models
with extensive context lengths. We demonstrate the efficacy of MTraining by
training Qwen2.5-3B, successfully expanding its context window from 32K to 512K
tokens on a cluster of 32 A100 GPUs. Our evaluations on a comprehensive suite
of downstream tasks, including RULER, PG-19, InfiniteBench, and Needle In A
Haystack, reveal that MTraining achieves up to a 6x higher training throughput
while preserving model accuracy. Our code is available at

Result: 实验结果显示新方法在个性化基准测试中显著优于传统方法，并在多个模型上取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的个性化强化学习框架，能有效提高语言模型的个性化性能。

Abstract: Faithfully personalizing large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is a critical but challenging task. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) quickly reaches a performance plateau, standard
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) also struggles with the
nuances of personalization. Scalar-based reward models are prone to reward
hacking which leads to verbose and superficially personalized responses. To
address these limitations, we propose Critique-Post-Edit, a robust
reinforcement learning framework that enables more faithful and controllable
personalization. Our framework integrates two key components: (1) a
Personalized Generative Reward Model (GRM) that provides multi-dimensional
scores and textual critiques to resist reward hacking, and (2) a
Critique-Post-Edit mechanism where the policy model revises its own outputs
based on these critiques for more targeted and efficient learning. Under a
rigorous length-controlled evaluation, our method substantially outperforms
standard PPO on personalization benchmarks. Personalized Qwen2.5-7B achieves an
average 11\% win-rate improvement, and personalized Qwen2.5-14B model surpasses
the performance of GPT-4.1. These results demonstrate a practical path to
faithful, efficient, and controllable personalization.

Motivation: 为了更好地理解大语言模型如何在不同层次上使用其深度，以提高计算效率，帮助未来的研究。

Method: 追踪开放权重模型在推理过程中的中间表征，并通过三个具体案例研究分析层深度的动态使用。

Result: 发现早期层的高频词预测主要是初步的统计猜测，随着上下文信息的提升，这些猜测会被精炼到更加上下文适宜的代币。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了大语言模型在推理过程中的层级预测动态，表明深度的使用是有结构且细致的，并提出了'猜测后精炼'框架来解释模型内部的计算结构。

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that large language models do not use their depth
uniformly, yet we still lack a fine-grained understanding of their layer-wise
prediction dynamics. In this paper, we trace the intermediate representations
of several open-weight models during inference and reveal a structured and
nuanced use of depth. Specifically, we propose a "Guess-then-Refine" framework
that explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make
predictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers
are composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical
guesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate
contextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the
model, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.
Even high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the
time, indicating that correct token prediction is not "one-and-done". We then
go beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer
depth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that
function words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)
Fact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token
requires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task
analysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the
first half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.
Together, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding
light on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions
and providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in
transformer-based models.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型架构中的建筑性锁定问题，使得任务特定行为能够跨不同模型架构进行转移。

Conclusion: CAST 能够在不同 LLM 架构之间实现有效的任务特定行为迁移，显著提升了模型的互操作性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) architectures presents a
fundamental challenge: valuable, task-specific behaviors learned through
fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are effectively trapped
within their source model's architecture, herein referred to architectural
lock-in. Existing transfer methods attempt to bridge this gap by aligning the
static weight spaces of models, a brittle and indirect approach that relies on
tenuous correlations between parameter geometries. This paper introduces a
fundamentally different and more direct paradigm: the Cartridge Activation
Space Transfer (CAST), a novel framework that liberates LoRA-encoded behaviors
by learning a direct, nonlinear mapping between the activation manifolds, the
geometric structures formed by the model's internal neuron activations, of two
distinct LLM architectures. CAST treats a pre-trained LoRA as a frozen
"behavioral kernel." It learns a set of lightweight, bidirectional projection
heads that translate the target model's activation stream into the source
model's latent space, apply the frozen kernel, and project the result back.
This process, trained on a general text corpus without any task-specific data,
effectively decouples the learned skill from the source architecture. We
demonstrate that CAST enables true "zero-shot" translation of any standard LoRA
adapter. Our experiments, including transfers between heterogeneous model
families like Llama-2 and Mistral, show that CAST-translated adapters achieve
85-95\% of the performance of a LoRA fully retrained on the target model,
quantitatively outperforming current weight-space transfer techniques and
establishing a new state-of-the-art in model interoperability.

*Zhiming Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了在固定令牌预算下，检索多样性对多轮意图理解的影响，并提出了一种新的多样性意识检索框架，取得了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在固定预算下，多样性的检索是否可以系统性地改善LLM意图理解，特别是在实际部署中面对的令牌预算紧张和噪声上下文的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于多样性的检索框架，通过选择上下文示例来平衡意图覆盖和语言多样性，并将该选择与标准LLM解码器结合。

Result: 在MultiWOZ 2.4和SGD数据集上，该方法在相同令牌预算下获得了强大的Joint Goal Accuracy提升，超越了强大的LLM/DST基线，并在示例数量、丰富度强度和基础模型大小的敏感性分析中表现良好。

Conclusion: 本研究验证了内容多样性在检索中的影响，并提出了一种简单可部署的选择原则，以构建准确且预算受限的多轮意图系统。

Abstract: Multi turn intent understanding is central to task oriented chatbots, yet
real deployments face tight token budgets and noisy contexts, and most
retrieval pipelines emphasize relevance while overlooking set level diversity
and confounds such as more context or exemplar order. We ask whether retrieval
diversity, rather than longer prompts, systematically improves LLM intent
understanding under fixed budgets. We present a diversity aware retrieval
framework that selects in context exemplars to balance intent coverage and
linguistic variety, and integrates this selection with standard LLM decoders;
the evaluation enforces budget matched prompts and randomized positions, and
includes sensitivity analyses over exemplar count, diversity strength, and
backbone size. On MultiWOZ 2.4 and SGD, the approach achieves strong gains in
Joint Goal Accuracy under equal token budgets, surpassing strong LLM/DST
baselines, with consistent improvements across K from 4 to 7 and moderate
latency. Overall, the study isolates and validates the impact of content
diversity in retrieval and offers a simple, deployable selection principle for
building accurate, budget constrained multi turn intent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in
mathematical and scientific tasks. To enhance complex reasoning, multi-agent
systems have been proposed to harness the collective intelligence of LLM
agents. However, existing collaboration structures are either predefined or
rely on majority voting or round-table debates, which can suppress correct but
less dominant agent contributions. Recent approaches model multi-agent systems
as graph networks but optimize purely for agent performance, neglecting the
quality of interactions. We hypothesize that effective agent communication is
crucial for multi-agent reasoning and that debating quality plays a significant
role. To address this, we propose $\ours$, a multi-agent verbal reinforcement
learning algorithm that dynamically constructs and refines multi-agent
collaboration structures. Our method defines action spaces and a feedback
mechanism that evaluates communication robustness and coherence throughout the
debate. The final decision is achieved through a majority vote over all the
agents. We assess $\ours$ on various reasoning tasks, including mathematical
reasoning, creative writing, scientific reasoning, and numerical sorting.
Results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms single-agent
prompting methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent frameworks on diverse tasks.

Motivation: 旨在克服传统建模方法对全局时间的依赖，提供更灵活、可扩展的动态系统建模解决方案。

Method: 通过将事件视为主体的固定行为，定义因果顺序，并利用声明性数据流机制来实现可执行本体，构建九个公理以确保正确性。

Result: 本文提出了一种主题-事件本体的形式化方法，用于建模复杂的动态系统，且无需依赖全局时间。关键原则包括：事件作为固定的行为、因果顺序通过先发生而定义、可执行本体的声明性数据流机制、模型作为认知过滤器、以及真理的假设。本体的形式化包含九个公理，确保可执行本体的正确性，并对基于模型的方法给予特别关注。本研究的实用性通过boldsea系统得到验证，该系统是一个用于可执行本体的工作流引擎，理论构建已在BSL（Boldsea语义语言）中实现。适用范围包括分布式系统、微服务架构、DLT平台及多视角场景。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的方式来理解和实现动态系统的建模，能够有效应用于多种复杂系统中。

Abstract: A formalization of a subject-event ontology is proposed for modeling complex
dynamic systems without reliance on global time. Key principles: (1) event as
an act of fixation - a subject discerns and fixes changes according to models
(conceptual templates) available to them; (2) causal order via happens-before -
the order of events is defined by explicit dependencies, not timestamps; (3)
making the ontology executable via a declarative dataflow mechanism, ensuring
determinism; (4) models as epistemic filters - a subject can only fix what
falls under its known concepts and properties; (5) presumption of truth - the
declarative content of an event is available for computation from the moment of
fixation, without external verification. The formalization includes nine axioms
(A1-A9), ensuring the correctness of executable ontologies: monotonicity of
history (I1), acyclicity of causality (I2), traceability (I3). Special
attention is given to the model-based approach (A9): event validation via
schemas, actor authorization, automatic construction of causal chains (W3)
without global time. Practical applicability is demonstrated on the boldsea
system - a workflow engine for executable ontologies, where the theoretical
constructs are implemented in BSL (Boldsea Semantic Language). The
formalization is applicable to distributed systems, microservice architectures,
DLT platforms, and multiperspectivity scenarios (conflicting facts from
different subjects).

TL;DR: 计划扩散是一种结合自回归和扩散模型的混合方法，在文本生成中有效提高速度和质量，且实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理中的一个核心挑战是生成速度与输出质量之间的权衡。

Method: 计划扩散分为两个阶段：首先创建一个自回归计划，将输出分解为较小的独立片段；然后使用扩散模型同时生成这些片段。

Result: 在AlpacaEval一套805个指令跟随提示中，计划扩散实现了质量和延迟之间的Pareto最优权衡，相较于自回归生成速度提升了1.27倍到1.81倍，同时仅造成0.87%到5.4%的成功率下降。

Conclusion: 计划扩散是一种有效的方法，通过结合自回归模型和扩散模型的优点，在文本生成中实现了速度和质量的最佳平衡。

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model inference is the trade-off
between generation speed and output quality. Autoregressive models produce
high-quality text but generate tokens sequentially. Diffusion models can
generate tokens in parallel but often need many iterations to match the same
quality. We propose planned diffusion, a hybrid method that combines the
strengths of both paradigms. Planned diffusion works in two stages: first, the
model creates a short autoregressive plan that breaks the output into smaller,
independent spans. Second, the model generates these spans simultaneously using
diffusion. This approach expands the speed-quality Pareto frontier and provides
a practical path to faster, high-quality text generation. On AlpacaEval, a
suite of 805 instruction-following prompts, planned diffusion achieves
Pareto-optimal trade-off between quality and latency, achieving 1.27x to 1.81x
speedup over autoregressive generation with only 0.87\% to 5.4\% drop in win
rate, respectively. Our sensitivity analysis shows that the planning mechanism
of planned diffusion is minimal and reliable, and simple runtime knobs exist to
provide flexible control of the quality-latency trade-off.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管小型语言模型在部署成本和延迟上具有优势，但在复杂领域特定任务中的准确性通常落后，监督微调的过程繁琐且需要大量人工投入，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 通过评估驱动的方法，PaDA-Agent实施了一种协调的数据增强流程，利用验证数据中的失败模式来生成针对性的增强策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，PaDA-Agent在Llama 3.2 1B指令模型微调中，相较于最先进的基于大型语言模型的数据增强方法，取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PaDA-Agent显著提高了小型语言模型在特定任务上的性能，成功缩小了与大型模型之间的准确性差距。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in deployment cost
and latency, but their accuracy often lags behind larger models, particularly
for complex domain-specific tasks. While supervised fine-tuning can help bridge
this performance gap, it requires substantial manual effort in data preparation
and iterative optimization. We present PaDA-Agent (Pattern-guided Data
Augmentation Agent), an evaluation-driven approach that streamlines the data
augmentation process for SLMs through coordinated operations. Unlike
state-of-the-art approaches that focus on model training errors only and
generating error-correcting samples, PaDA-Agent discovers failure patterns from
the validation data via evaluations and drafts targeted data augmentation
strategies aiming to directly reduce the generalization gap. Our experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based
data augmentation approaches for Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the importance of monitoring chain-of-thought
reasoning for AI safety; however, current approaches that analyze textual
reasoning steps can miss subtle harmful patterns and may be circumvented by
models that hide unsafe reasoning. We present a sentence-level labeled dataset
that enables activation-based monitoring of safety behaviors during LLM
reasoning. Our dataset contains reasoning sequences with sentence-level
annotations of safety behaviors such as expression of safety concerns or
speculation on user intent, which we use to extract steering vectors for
detecting and influencing these behaviors within model activations. The dataset
fills a key gap in safety research: while existing datasets label reasoning
holistically, effective application of steering vectors for safety monitoring
could be improved by identifying precisely when specific behaviors occur within
reasoning chains. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by extracting
representations that both detect and steer safety behaviors in model
activations, showcasing the potential of activation-level techniques for
improving safety oversight on reasoning.

Method: 提出了一种新的无训练采样算法，名为Saber，采用自适应加速和逆向生成的机制。

Result: 在多个主流代码生成基准上，Saber的Pass@1准确率平均提升1.9%，推理速度提升251.4%。

Conclusion: Saber显著提高了代码生成的Pass@1准确率和推理速度，缩小了与自回归模型的性能差距。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) are emerging as a powerful and promising
alternative to the dominant autoregressive paradigm, offering inherent
advantages in parallel generation and bidirectional context modeling. However,
the performance of DLMs on code generation tasks, which have stronger
structural constraints, is significantly hampered by the critical trade-off
between inference speed and output quality. We observed that accelerating the
code generation process by reducing the number of sampling steps usually leads
to a catastrophic collapse in performance. In this paper, we introduce
efficient Sampling with Adaptive acceleration and Backtracking Enhanced
Remasking (i.e., Saber), a novel training-free sampling algorithm for DLMs to
achieve better inference speed and output quality in code generation.
Specifically, Saber is motivated by two key insights in the DLM generation
process: 1) it can be adaptively accelerated as more of the code context is
established; 2) it requires a backtracking mechanism to reverse the generated
tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream code generation benchmarks
show that Saber boosts Pass@1 accuracy by an average improvement of 1.9% over
mainstream DLM sampling methods, meanwhile achieving an average 251.4%
inference speedup. By leveraging the inherent advantages of DLMs, our work
significantly narrows the performance gap with autoregressive models in code
generation.

Result: 通过框架发现当代 AI 模型具有高度不均衡的认知特征，尤其在语言知识领域表现良好，但在基础认知能力上存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: 尽管 AI 系统在某些领域取得了快速进展，但要实现 AGI 仍需克服诸多基础性缺陷，特别是在长时记忆存储方面。

Abstract: The lack of a concrete definition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
obscures the gap between today's specialized AI and human-level cognition. This
paper introduces a quantifiable framework to address this, defining AGI as
matching the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult. To
operationalize this, we ground our methodology in Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory,
the most empirically validated model of human cognition. The framework dissects
general intelligence into ten core cognitive domains-including reasoning,
memory, and perception-and adapts established human psychometric batteries to
evaluate AI systems. Application of this framework reveals a highly "jagged"
cognitive profile in contemporary models. While proficient in
knowledge-intensive domains, current AI systems have critical deficits in
foundational cognitive machinery, particularly long-term memory storage. The
resulting AGI scores (e.g., GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 58%) concretely quantify
both rapid progress and the substantial gap remaining before AGI.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的 token 选择方法存在两个主要局限性：需要额外的参考模型，并且仅依赖损失信息进行选择，不能有效保留具有重要语义的 tokens。

Method: 提出了一种自我调节和语义感知的 token 选择方法，通过历史模型计算每个 token 的损失差异，实现自适应的 token 选择。同时引入与基于损失的选择正交的语义感知估计指标。

Result: ssToken的自我调节选择和语义感知选择单独都优于传统的全数据微调，结合后达到协同增益，显著超越了先前的 token 选择方法。

Conclusion: ssToken在选择重要 tokens 方面表现优越，结合自我调节选择和语义感知选择，超过以往的选择方法，提升了性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Data quality plays a critical role in enhancing supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
for large language models (LLMs), and token-level data selection has emerged as
a promising direction for its fine-grained nature. Despite their strong
empirical performance, existing token-level selection methods share two key
limitations: (1) requiring training or accessing an additional reference model,
and (2) relying solely on loss information for token selection, which cannot
well preserve semantically important tokens that are not favored by loss-based
metrics. To address these challenges, we propose ssToken, a Self-modulated and
Semantic-aware Token Selection approach. ssToken leverages readily accessible
history models to compute the per-token loss difference with the current model,
which serves as a self-modulated signal that enables the model to adaptively
select tokens along its optimization trajectory, rather than relying on excess
loss from an offline-trained reference model as in prior works. We further
introduce a semantic-aware, attention-based token importance estimation metric,
orthogonal to loss-based selection and providing complementary semantic
information for more effective filtering. Extensive experiments across
different model families and scales demonstrate that both self-modulated
selection and semantic-aware selection alone outperform full-data fine-tuning,
while their integration--ssToken--achieves synergistic gains and further
surpasses prior token-level selection methods, delivering performance
improvements while maintaining training efficiency.

Method: 测试八个前沿模型在一个简单的、开放但受规则约束的真实任务上的表现，任务是生成有效的科学测试题项，并在考虑自身批评后进行修改。

Result: 首次尝试的表现差（常常零有效项），反思仅带来适度提升，而反复尝试常常重复相同的约束违规，表明纠正收益主要是偶然性的。

Conclusion: 当前的大型语言模型的‘反思’能力在功能上并不等同于人类的反思推理，缺乏主动的、目标驱动的监测机制以遵循约束。

Abstract: Humans do not just find mistakes after the fact -- we often catch them
mid-stream because 'reflection' is tied to the goal and its constraints.
Today's large language models produce reasoning tokens and 'reflective' text,
but is it functionally equivalent with human reflective reasoning? Prior work
on closed-ended tasks -- with clear, external 'correctness' signals -- can make
'reflection' look effective while masking limits in self-correction. We
therefore test eight frontier models on a simple, real-world task that is
open-ended yet rule-constrained, with auditable success criteria: to produce
valid scientific test items, then revise after considering their own critique.
First-pass performance is poor (often zero valid items out of 4 required; mean
$\approx$ 1), and reflection yields only modest gains (also $\approx$ 1).
Crucially, the second attempt frequently repeats the same violation of
constraint, indicating 'corrective gains' arise largely from chance production
of a valid item rather than error detection and principled,
constraint-sensitive repair. Performance before and after reflection
deteriorates as open-endedness increases, and models marketed for 'reasoning'
show no advantage. Our results suggest that current LLM 'reflection' lacks
functional evidence of the active, goal-driven monitoring that helps humans
respect constraints even on a first pass. Until such mechanisms are
instantiated in the model itself, reliable performance requires external
structure that enforces constraints.

Abstract: Geospatial data offers immense potential for understanding our planet.
However, the sheer volume and diversity of this data along with its varied

we developed a Gemini-powered agent that jointly reasons over our multiple

Abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection (MUAD) has garnered growing
research interest, as it seeks to develop a unified model for anomaly detection
across multiple classes, i.e., eliminating the need to train separate models
for distinct objects and thereby saving substantial computational resources.
Under the MUAD setting, while advanced Transformer-based architectures have
brought significant performance improvements, identity shortcuts persist: they
directly copy inputs to outputs, narrowing the gap in reconstruction errors
between normal and abnormal cases, and thereby making the two harder to
distinguish. Therefore, we propose ShortcutBreaker, a novel unified
feature-reconstruction framework for MUAD tasks, featuring two key innovations
to address the issue of shortcuts. First, drawing on matrix rank inequality, we
design a low-rank noisy bottleneck (LRNB) to project highdimensional features
into a low-rank latent space, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to
prevent trivial identity reproduction. Second, leveraging ViTs global modeling
capability instead of merely focusing on local features, we incorporate a
global perturbation attention to prevent information shortcuts in the decoders.
Extensive experiments are performed on four widely used anomaly detection
benchmarks, including three industrial datasets (MVTec-AD, ViSA, and Real-IAD)
and one medical dataset (Universal Medical). The proposed method achieves a
remarkable image-level AUROC of 99.8%, 98.9%, 90.6%, and 87.8% on these four
datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming previous MUAD methods across
different scenarios.

Motivation: 旨在填补现有自我对抗学习方法在处理开放式学习场景中的不足，通过引入不对称的教学机制来改善学习效率。

Method: 提出了异质对抗游戏（HAP）框架，该框架通过将教师—学生互动形式化为一个极小极大优化问题，实现教师与学习者的协同进化。

Result: 该论文提出了一种新的自我对抗学习框架——异质对抗游戏（HAP），用于实现自主学习者与任务生成者之间的优化互动。HAP通过双向反馈机制，实时调整任务复杂性，以提升学习效率。实验表明，该框架的效果与现有先进技术相当，同时在人工智能和人类学习者中均能有效提升学习效果。

Conclusion: HAP框架成功实现了自我对抗学习中的任务生成与学习者之间的动态互动，提升了学习效率。

Abstract: Self-play constitutes a fundamental paradigm for autonomous skill
acquisition, whereby agents iteratively enhance their capabilities through
self-directed environmental exploration. Conventional self-play frameworks
exploit agent symmetry within zero-sum competitive settings, yet this approach
proves inadequate for open-ended learning scenarios characterized by inherent
asymmetry. Human pedagogical systems exemplify asymmetric instructional
frameworks wherein educators systematically construct challenges calibrated to
individual learners' developmental trajectories. The principal challenge
resides in operationalizing these asymmetric, adaptive pedagogical mechanisms
within artificial systems capable of autonomously synthesizing appropriate
curricula without predetermined task hierarchies. Here we present Heterogeneous
Adversarial Play (HAP), an adversarial Automatic Curriculum Learning framework
that formalizes teacher-student interactions as a minimax optimization wherein
task-generating instructor and problem-solving learner co-evolve through
adversarial dynamics. In contrast to prevailing ACL methodologies that employ
static curricula or unidirectional task selection mechanisms, HAP establishes a
bidirectional feedback system wherein instructors continuously recalibrate task
complexity in response to real-time learner performance metrics. Experimental
validation across multi-task learning domains demonstrates that our framework
achieves performance parity with SOTA baselines while generating curricula that
enhance learning efficacy in both artificial agents and human subjects.

Result: 提出了一种名为Med-VRAgent的框架，通过结合视觉引导、自我奖励和蒙特卡洛树搜索来提升医疗视觉推理能力。

Conclusion: Med-VRAgent在多个医疗VQA基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results in medical reasoning
but struggle with hallucinations, vague descriptions, inconsistent logic and
poor localization. To address this, we propose a agent framework named Medical
Visual Reasoning Agent (\textbf{Med-VRAgent}). The approach is based on Visual
Guidance and Self-Reward paradigms and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). By
combining the Visual Guidance with tree search, Med-VRAgent improves the
medical visual reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We use the trajectories
collected by Med-VRAgent as feedback to further improve the performance by
fine-tuning the VLMs with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) objective.
Experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches.

Motivation: 随着气候变化加剧，城市水logging对公共安全和基础设施构成威胁，现有的监测方法不足以满足需求。

Method: 采用基础模型驱动框架，结合半监督微调策略和链式思考提示策略。

Result: 在视觉基准测试中的评估表明UWAssess在感知性能上有显著提高，同时生成准确的文本报告。

Conclusion: UWAssess提供了一种自动化的城市水logging评估方法，能够生成可靠的评估报告，支持城市管理和应对气候变化。

Abstract: With climate change intensifying, urban waterlogging poses an increasingly
severe threat to global public safety and infrastructure. However, existing
monitoring approaches rely heavily on manual reporting and fail to provide
timely and comprehensive assessments. In this study, we present Urban
Waterlogging Assessment (UWAssess), a foundation model-driven framework that
automatically identifies waterlogged areas in surveillance images and generates
structured assessment reports. To address the scarcity of labeled data, we
design a semi-supervised fine-tuning strategy and a chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting strategy to unleash the potential of the foundation model for
data-scarce downstream tasks. Evaluations on challenging visual benchmarks
demonstrate substantial improvements in perception performance. GPT-based
evaluations confirm the ability of UWAssess to generate reliable textual
reports that accurately describe waterlogging extent, depth, risk and impact.
This dual capability enables a shift of waterlogging monitoring from perception
to generation, while the collaborative framework of multiple foundation models
lays the groundwork for intelligent and scalable systems, supporting urban
management, disaster response and climate resilience.

Motivation: 解决优化建模中的自动化难题，尤其是将非正式语言转换为精准的数学模型与可执行代码的过程。

Method: AlphaOPT 通过两个阶段循环：库学习阶段和库进化阶段，逐步提取并优化对问题的解决方案。

Result: AlphaOPT 在训练数据增加时表现出逐步改进，并在仅使用答案进行训练的情况下，在 OptiBench 数据集上超越了最强对比基准。

Conclusion: AlphaOPT 展示了在优化建模中，通过自我改善的体验库来提高 LLM 的学习能力和适用性，尤其是在缺乏标注推理轨迹的情况下。

Abstract: Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but
remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise
mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches
either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited
generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that
enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone,
without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated
reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual
two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts,
extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition,
explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses
retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored
insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently
from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually
without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights,
and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and
intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data
(65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest
baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only
on answers. Code and data are available at:

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在不确定环境下进行决策时面临的挑战，特别是在多步骤决策任务中。

Method: 引入蒙特卡罗树搜索(MCTS)结合量化分布，以建模决策的不确定性，并通过UCC评分优化树搜索过程。

Result: 本文介绍了一种新的LLM决策方法PlanU，旨在解决在不确定环境中进行决策时的挑战。PlanU结合了蒙特卡罗树搜索(MCTS)和量化分布，以更好地捕捉不确定性，并通过引入好奇心的上置信界限(UCC)评分，平衡探索与利用。实验结果显示，PlanU在处理不确定决策任务方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PlanU有效提升了在不确定环境中进行LLM决策的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored across a range
of decision-making tasks. However, LLMs sometimes struggle with decision-making
tasks under uncertainty that are relatively easy for humans, such as planning
actions in stochastic environments. The adoption of LLMs for decision-making is
impeded by uncertainty challenges, such as LLM uncertainty and environmental
uncertainty. LLM uncertainty arises from the stochastic sampling process
inherent to LLMs. Most LLM-based Decision-Making (LDM) approaches address LLM
uncertainty through multiple reasoning chains or search trees. However, these
approaches overlook environmental uncertainty, which leads to poor performance
in environments with stochastic state transitions. Some recent LDM approaches
deal with uncertainty by forecasting the probability of unknown variables.
However, they are not designed for multi-step decision-making tasks that
require interaction with the environment. To address uncertainty in LLM
decision-making, we introduce PlanU, an LLM-based planning method that captures
uncertainty within Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). PlanU models the return of
each node in the MCTS as a quantile distribution, which uses a set of quantiles
to represent the return distribution. To balance exploration and exploitation
during tree search, PlanU introduces an Upper Confidence Bounds with Curiosity
(UCC) score which estimates the uncertainty of MCTS nodes. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PlanU in LLM-based
decision-making tasks under uncertainty.

TL;DR: CircuitSeer是一种新型数据选择方法，通过分析模型的内部机制，提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的推理能力增强，现有的数据选择方法需依赖外部模型或不透明的启发式方法，因此需要一种新的高效数据选择方法。

Method: 提出CircuitSeer方法，专注于模型内部机制，量化数据对特定注意力头的影响。

Result: 在4个模型和9个数据集上的广泛实验中，CircuitSeer表现出优越性，使用选定数据的10%进行微调比使用全数据集提高了1.4点的平均Pass@1。

Conclusion: CircuitSeer是一种高效的数据选择方法，通过测量数据对核心推理电路的影响来量化推理复杂性，从而提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, but scaling their performance often relies on massive reasoning
datasets that are computationally expensive to train on. Existing data
selection methods aim to curate smaller, high-quality subsets but often rely on
costly external models or opaque heuristics. In this work, we shift the focus
from external heuristics to the model's internal mechanisms. We find that
complex reasoning tasks consistently activate a sparse, specialized subset of
attention heads, forming core reasoning circuits. Building on this insight, we
propose CircuitSeer, a novel data selection method that quantifies the
reasoning complexity of data by measuring its influence on these crucial
circuits. Extensive experiments on 4 models and 9 datasets demonstrate
CircuitSeer's superiority. Notably, fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on just 10% of
data selected by our method achieves a 1.4-point gain in average Pass@1 over
training on the full dataset, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: Control algorithms in production environments typically require domain
experts to tune their parameters and logic for specific scenarios. However,
existing research predominantly focuses on algorithmic performance under ideal

To bridge this gap, we introduce Crucible, an agent that employs an LLM-driven,
multi-level expert simulation to turn algorithms and defines a formalized
metric to quantitatively evaluate their Tuning Potential. We demonstrate
Crucible's effectiveness across a wide spectrum of case studies, from classic
control tasks to complex computer systems, and validate its findings in a
real-world deployment. Our experimental results reveal that Crucible
systematically quantifies the tunable space across different algorithms.
Furthermore, Crucible provides a new dimension for algorithm analysis and
design, which ultimately leads to performance improvements. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出COUPLE框架以处理大型语言模型与多元价值对齐的问题，展示了其在两个不同价值体系数据集上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将大型语言模型与多元的人类价值观对齐，同时解决现有方法中对价值复杂性和可操控性的问题。

Method: COUPLE框架

Result: COUPLE通过结构性因果模型引入复杂的价值相互依赖和优先级，并使用反事实推理生成与所需价值目标一致的输出，展示了在不同价值体系数据集上的有效性。

Conclusion: COUPLE框架有效改善了大型语言模型在对齐多元价值目标时的表现，提供了更好的可解释性和对复杂价值关系的建模能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
applications serving users across diverse cultures, communities and
demographics, it is critical to align LLMs with pluralistic human values beyond
average principles (e.g., HHH). In psychological and social value theories such
as Schwartz's Value Theory, pluralistic values are represented by multiple
value dimensions paired with various priorities. However, existing methods
encounter two challenges when aligning with such fine-grained value objectives:
1) they often treat multiple values as independent and equally important,
ignoring their interdependence and relative priorities (value complexity); 2)
they struggle to precisely control nuanced value priorities, especially those
underrepresented ones (value steerability). To handle these challenges, we
propose COUPLE, a COUnterfactual reasoning framework for PLuralistic valuE
alignment. It introduces a structural causal model (SCM) to feature complex
interdependency and prioritization among features, as well as the causal
relationship between high-level value dimensions and behaviors. Moreover, it
applies counterfactual reasoning to generate outputs aligned with any desired
value objectives. Benefitting from explicit causal modeling, COUPLE also
provides better interpretability. We evaluate COUPLE on two datasets with
different value systems and demonstrate that COUPLE advances other baselines
across diverse types of value objectives.

Method: 通过从后训练模型中提取数据来改善模型能力

Result: 成功提取大量对齐训练数据，并恢复了原始性能的显著部分

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型提取对齐数据的风险，以及蒸馏实践对模型训练集的间接影响

Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to extract significant amounts of
alignment training data from a post-trained model -- useful to steer the model
to improve certain capabilities such as long-context reasoning, safety,
instruction following, and maths. While the majority of related work on
memorisation has focused on measuring success of training data extraction
through string matching, we argue that embedding models are better suited for
our specific goals. Distances measured through a high quality embedding model
can identify semantic similarities between strings that a different metric such
as edit distance will struggle to capture. In fact, in our investigation,
approximate string matching would have severely undercounted (by a conservative
estimate of $10\times$) the amount of data that can be extracted due to trivial
artifacts that deflate the metric. Interestingly, we find that models readily
regurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or
RL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a
meaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a
possibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work
opens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation
practices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,
distillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's
original dataset.

Abstract: Automating quantitative trading strategy development in dynamic markets is

preferences, such as strategy type, risk profile, turnover, and return
characteristics, to maintain a diverse set of effective strategies. It also
integrates a hypothesis-driven multi-agent system to systematically explore the
strategy space through iterative generation and evaluation. This approach
produces diverse, sophisticated strategies that adapt to both market regime
shifts and individual investment needs. Empirical results show that QuantEvolve
outperforms conventional baselines, validating its effectiveness. We release a

Result: VAR-7B在全面的幻觉和安全基准测试中表现优秀，超越了现有开源模型，并对领先的专有系统展现了竞争力。

Conclusion: VAR框架通过反向追踪和多维奖励函数有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，解决了高幻觉率问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), despite their advances, are
hindered by their high hallucination tendency and heavy reliance on brittle,
linear reasoning processes, leading to failures in complex tasks. To address
these limitations, we introduce Visual Attention Reasoning (VAR), a novel
framework that recasts grounded reasoning as a structured search over a
reasoning trajectory space. VAR decomposes the reasoning process into two key
stages: traceable evidence grounding and search-based chain-of-thought (CoT)
generation, which incorporates a backtracking mechanism for self-correction.
The search is guided by a multi-faceted reward function with semantic and
geometric self-verification components, which penalize outputs that are not
faithfully grounded in the visual input. We provide a theoretical analysis for
our search strategy, validating its capability to find the correct solution
with high probability. Experimental results show that our 7B model, VAR-7B,
sets a new state-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of hallucination and
safety benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing open-source models and
demonstrating competitive performance against leading proprietary systems.

Abstract: We present a new approach to classification that combines data and knowledge.
In this approach, data mining is used to derive association rules (possibly
with negations) from data. Those rules are leveraged to increase the predictive
performance of tree-based models (decision trees and random forests) used for a
classification task. They are also used to improve the corresponding
explanation task through the generation of abductive explanations that are more
general than those derivable without taking such rules into account.
Experiments show that for the two tree-based models under consideration,
benefits can be offered by the approach in terms of predictive performance and

Abstract: Modelling qualitative uncertainty in formal argumentation is essential both
for practical applications and theoretical understanding. Yet, most of the
existing works focus on \textit{abstract} models for arguing with uncertainty.
Following a recent trend in the literature, we tackle the open question of
studying plausible instantiations of these abstract models. To do so, we ground
the uncertainty of arguments in their components, structured within rules and
premises. Our main technical contributions are: i) the introduction of a notion
of expressivity that can handle abstract and structured formalisms, and ii) the
presentation of both negative and positive expressivity results, comparing the
expressivity of abstract and structured models of argumentation with
uncertainty. These results affect incomplete abstract argumentation frameworks,
and their extension with dependencies, on the abstract side, and ASPIC+, on the
structured side.

Conclusion: 研究表明，利用排名信息和人类判断来估计文档相关性可以显著提高生成系统的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address complex user requests by
decomposing them into subqueries, retrieving potentially relevant documents for
each, and then aggregating them to generate an answer. Efficiently selecting
informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving
broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting
retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query
decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting,
where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a
given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an
alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and
demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative
sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank
information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision,
15% increase in {\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of
long-form generation.

Result: SherlockLLM在结构化任务表现出色，接近理论最优，且在非结构化任务中显著超越其他基线。

Conclusion: SherlockLLM展示了在信息检索中学习有效对话策略的能力，尤其在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it
challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While
recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent,
they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most
informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a
dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy
via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated
dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of
binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our
approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks.
Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution.
On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and
approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging
unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines,
showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue
policy.

Motivation: 气候变化加剧了有害藻华(HAB)的发生，尤其是蓝藻，因此需要更高效的监测方法来评估其对水生态系统和人类健康的威胁。

Method: 通过整合GeoSAM辅助人工评估进行高质量分割掩模的策划，并使用NASA的Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels(CAML)对视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: ALGOS系统在藻华监测中的分割和严重程度评估上表现出了稳健的性能，推动了自动化监测系统的可能性。

Conclusion: ALGOS展示了其在有害藻华监测方面的有效性，表明未来可以实现更自动化的监测系统。

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying the occurrence of harmful algal bloom (HAB),
particularly cyanobacteria, which threaten aquatic ecosystems and human health
through oxygen depletion, toxin release, and disruption of marine biodiversity.
Traditional monitoring approaches, such as manual water sampling, remain
labor-intensive and limited in spatial and temporal coverage. Recent advances
in vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing have shown potential for
scalable AI-driven solutions, yet challenges remain in reasoning over imagery
and quantifying bloom severity. In this work, we introduce ALGae Observation
and Segmentation (ALGOS), a segmentation-and-reasoning system for HAB
monitoring that combines remote sensing image understanding with severity
estimation. Our approach integrates GeoSAM-assisted human evaluation for
high-quality segmentation mask curation and fine-tunes vision language model on
severity prediction using the Cyanobacteria Aggregated Manual Labels (CAML)
from NASA. Experiments demonstrate that ALGOS achieves robust performance on
both segmentation and severity-level estimation, paving the way toward
practical and automated cyanobacterial monitoring systems.

Motivation: 为了优化国家科学投资，需要深入理解研究趋势及其背后的社会、地理因素，尤其是考虑公平、多样性和包容性。

Method: 对比评估三种主题建模方法：LDA、STM和BERTopic，并引入新算法COFFEE用于协变量效应估计。

Result: 通过对NSERC资助的研究提案进行18年的数据分析，发现BERTopic在识别细粒度和新兴主题方面表现最佳，同时揭示了省级研究专业化和性别主题模式。

Conclusion: 本研究为资助机构提供了实证基础，帮助制定更公平和有效的资助策略，促进科学生态系统的提升。

Abstract: Optimizing national scientific investment requires a clear understanding of
evolving research trends and the demographic and geographical forces shaping
them, particularly in light of commitments to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
This study addresses this need by analyzing 18 years (2005-2022) of research
proposals funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada (NSERC). We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three
topic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic
Modelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named
COFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.
This advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native
function for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings
highlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,
BERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and
emergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.
Additionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct
provincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based
thematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a
robust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more
equitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness
of the scientific ecosystem.

### [173] [CARLE: A Hybrid Deep-Shallow Learning Framework for Robust and Explainable RUL Estimation of Rolling Element Bearings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17846)
*Waleed Razzaq,Yun-Bo Zhao*

TL;DR: 本文提出CARLE框架，通过结合深浅层学习，增强RUL预测的准确性和稳健性，尤其在动态条件下表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有RUL方法在变化操作条件下缺乏普遍性和稳健性的问题，提出CARLE框架以提升预测准确性。

Method: 介绍了一种混合AI框架CARLE，结合深度学习与浅层学习，采用Res-CNN和Res-LSTM模块，使用随机森林回归器进行RUL预测。

Result: CARLE在多个数据集上表现优于多种先进方法，尤其是在动态条件下。通过消融研究评估各组件的贡献，并进行噪声和跨领域实验验证模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: CARLE框架在动态条件下的RUL预测中表现优异，并且展现出较强的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Conclusion: MIN-Merging proves to be an effective and practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in model merging, enhancing performance in domain-specific tasks while maintaining generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在实际应用中的集成不断增加，出现了隐私和安全方面的担忧，需求去除不良知识，因此探索机器反学习成为必要。

Conclusion: 提出了一种可扩展又保护隐私的联邦反学习方法，能有效处理异质的反学习请求，同时保持强大的大型语言模型效用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

Result: 该论文提出了一个统一的基准，旨在解决变压器基础的大型语言模型在长上下文训练中的计算和内存成本瓶颈问题。通过系统评估注意力机制和上下文并行策略，该基准能够比较不同方法在效率、可扩展性和可用性方面的表现，并提供设计和部署注意力机制的实用指导。

Conclusion: 通过在高达96个GPU的集群上进行的全面实验，本基准能够实现可重复的比较，并突出不同方法之间的权衡，为长上下文语言模型的训练提供实用建议。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

Motivation: 通过将低秩适配器集成到MoE模型中，旨在提高大规模语言模型的训练效率和参数利用率。

Method: 提出了一种新的轻量级混合专家框架L-MoE，将低秩适配器融入混合专家架构中。

Result: L-MoE模型通过动态组合任务专用的低秩适配器，实现了高效的参数利用，并且具有模块化设计。

Conclusion: L-MoE为构建更高效、可扩展和专业化的语言模型提供了新的方法。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

Result: 在四个实际自动调优应用及六个硬件平台上的评估显示，以额外的应用和搜索空间特定信息生成的算法显著提升了性能，平均改善30.7%和14.6%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的优化算法在自动调优任务中表现优越，平均性能提升达到72.4%。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

Motivation: 传统的垂直联邦学习在训练过程中通信需求高，影响隐私和安全，并且可能导致能耗大和训练不可行。

Method: 引入Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning (SBVFL)，通过分布式训练机制增强隐私和安全性，减少节点与服务器之间的通信。

Result: SBVFL相比标准VFL减少了约99%的通信，同时保持了模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SBVFL能够实现有效的隐私保护，同时减少通信开销，适用于对安全性要求高的领域。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support
reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral,

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Conclusion: 本文提出的时间-频率选择性方法对扩散模型的数据遗忘问题提供了新的解决方案，能有效提高生成样本的质量。

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

Result: COMPASS在多种推理任务和模型架构上展示了显著的一致性性能提升。

Conclusion: COMPASS提升了大语言模型的分析能力，通过自主学习和新的奖励机制在多种推理任务中显著提高了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Result: 训练使用合成数据在LiveCodeBench和AgentBench-OS任务上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著改善了训练效果，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

*Jaihoon Kim,Rajarshi Saha,Minhyuk Sung,Youngsuk Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TM在特定条件下相较于FM具有更高的生成质量和更快的收敛速度，特别是在目标分布为分离良好的模式时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TM为何在采样步数较少的情况下能够超越FM的性能。

Method: 通过理论分析和控制实验验证TM在不同分布下的表现，尤其是高斯分布。

Result: TM在一定条件下，如目标为单模高斯分布时，相对于FM具有更低的KL散度和更快的收敛速率，本质上是因为TM中的随机差异潜在更新。

Conclusion: TM在目标分布具有良好分离的模式和非忽略方差时 outperform FM。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

TL;DR: A-DATSC是一种新型深度子空间聚类模型，解决了现有方法的多项局限，尤其在4D时空数据上的聚类效果显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度子空间聚类方法存在多个局限性，如忽略聚类错误、重视全局特征而忽视局部结构、未能有效建模长距离依赖和位置信息，并且很少应用于4D时空数据。

Method: 提出了一种结合生成器和鉴别器的深度子空间聚类模型A-DATSC，生成器采用类似U-Net的结构，通过堆叠TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D层来保持空间和时间的完整性。

Result: 在三个真实的多变量时空数据集上的实验表明，A-DATSC显著提高了聚类性能。

Conclusion: A-DATSC模型在处理4D时空数据方面表现出显著的聚类性能，超越了现有的深度子空间聚类模型。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Conclusion: STONe为跨领域操作推断建立了一般原则，能够在物理、气候和能源系统中实现复杂时空场的实时预测。

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

Conclusion: ACIA在抗因果表示学习中表现优越，具备理论保障和强大的适应性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应发散正则化策略优化（ADRPO），解决了强化学习微调生成模型中探索与利用的平衡问题，实现了在多种任务中的显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习微调生成模型时，固定的正则化方法造成了探索与利用之间的矛盾，因此需要一种动态调整的方法。

Method: 提出了一种自适应的正则化策略，通过根据优势估计动态调整正则化强度来优化策略。

Result: ADRPO展示了在文本到图像生成、文本模型微调和多模态推理任务中优于现有方法的能力，能够在更小模型中实现与更大模型相匹敌的性能。

Conclusion: ADRPO在多种生成模型中的有效性表现出色，能够平衡探索和利用，同时在保持生成多样性的同时提升语义一致性和艺术风格转移能力。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

Motivation: 解决现有流基生成模型在文本到图像生成中微调困难的问题，并克服信用分配、训练不稳定性和模型崩溃等挑战

Method: 提出了一种新的actor-critic框架AC-Flow

Conclusion: AC-Flow在不牺牲生成质量和稳定性的情况下，能有效微调流模型并保持模型的多样性。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

Motivation: 在许多现实应用中，需要确保高平均性能并保证成功的概率，以应对不确定性和风险。

Method: 提出一种新的强化学习(RL)框架，以最大化累积回报超过预定义阈值的概率，从而解决可靠策略的问题。

Result: 通过状态增强表示将可靠RL问题重构为标准RL问题，利用现有的RL算法如Q-learning和Dueling Double DQN，得出了理论结果，证明了两种表述的等价性。

Conclusion: 数值实验表明，所提框架能有效平衡效率与可靠性，展示了在随机和安全关键环境下应用可靠RL的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Motivation: 解决LLM在面对有害查询时存在的浅层对齐问题，以确保在生成过程中能够有效拒绝有害内容。

Method: 提出了一种名为Any-Depth Alignment (ADA) 的推理时防御机制，通过重新引入助手头部标记来确保在生成的任意深度都能做出拒绝。

Result: ADA在多种开源模型家族上表现出色，能够在面对复杂的对抗性提示攻击时，保持近100%的拒绝率，同时对无害任务的影响最小。

Conclusion: ADA能够在不更改基模型参数的情况下，显著提高LLM在生成过程中应对有害查询的能力，并保持在无害任务上的效用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

Result: 理论上证明了在过滤的MDP中学习是安全的，并且探索策略在实现安全保障的同时，不影响最终的性能。实践中在Safety Gymnasium上验证了理论结果，观察到训练过程中零违规，最终表现与未过滤基线相匹配或超出。

Conclusion: 通过足够宽松的安全过滤器，确保安全并不会降低强化学习的渐进性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Conclusion: LDDMs在无条件生成指标上优于现有的掩码离散扩散基线且在低采样预算时表现出色。

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

TL;DR: 研究表明，Rectified Flows在确定性训练下容易导致记忆化，尽管处理的插值线路相交，但通过注入噪声可以改善泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析Rectified Flows在处理源到目标分布的直线路径时隐藏的根本性失败模式。

Method: 通过对高斯到高斯传输的研究，用损失梯度方差来分析确定性和随机性训练的向量场优化偏好。

Result: 实验证明，在CelebA数据集上，确定性插值会导致记忆化，而注入少量噪声则能恢复泛化能力。

Conclusion: 确定性插值的训练方式会导致模型记忆训练数据，而引入随机噪声可有效恢复模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

TL;DR: 提出核心注意力解耦技术（CAD），改善长上下文大语言模型训练，提升训练吞吐量和计算资源平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的系统在长上下文长度时，由于核心注意力的计算增长过快，导致负载不均衡和延迟现象，CAD旨在解决这个问题。

Method: CAD技术将核心注意力拆分为令牌级任务，并将其调度到专用注意力服务器上，这些服务器动态重新组合任务以平衡计算量。

Result: 本文提出了一种核心注意力解耦技术（CAD），该技术通过将核心注意力计算（softmax(QK^T)V）与模型的其余部分解耦并在专用设备池上执行，从而改善了长上下文大语言模型的训练。

Conclusion: 通过在512个H200 GPU上实现CAD，系统DistCA在最大上下文长度512k tokens下将端到端训练吞吐量提高了1.35倍，消除了数据和管道并行的延迟，达到了几乎完美的计算与内存平衡。

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Conclusion: 提出的新算法在与最先进方法的实证比较中表现良好，并引入了具有鲁棒性的PCA的核对偶形式。

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and

PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

TL;DR: NashPG算法通过固定正则化强度，并优化参考策略，实现了在复杂博弈中寻找纳什均衡的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多主体强化学习中，寻找不完全信息博弈的纳什均衡是一个重要挑战，现有正则化方法在实际中表现不稳定。

Method: 通过固定较大的正则化强度，迭代优化参考策略，以实现在二人零和博弈中的精确纳什均衡收敛。

Result: 该理论框架保证了严格单调改进，并在不要求唯一性的前提下实现了收敛到精确纳什均衡的结果。

Conclusion: Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG)算法在经典基准游戏和大规模领域展示了良好的效果，能够提供与现有方法相当或更低的利用率，并实现较高的Elo评级。

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为 ActivationReasoning 的框架，旨在将逻辑推理嵌入大型语言模型的潜在空间，提高模型的透明度和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型擅长生成流畅文本，但其内部推理仍然不透明且难以控制，因此需要改进逻辑推理能力。

Method: AR 框架分为三个阶段：寻找潜在表示、激活命题和逻辑推理。

Result: AR 在多跳推理、抽象性和对间接概念提示的鲁棒性、自然语言推理和上下文敏感安全等任务上表现出色，具有很好的可扩展性和普适性。

Conclusion: 通过在潜在激活中建立逻辑结构，ActivationReasoning 框架不仅提高了透明度，还实现了结构化推理、可靠控制和与期望行为的校准，为实现更可靠和可审计的人工智能提供了路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

Motivation: 为了解决HJB方程在数值求解中的计算复杂性以及缺乏解析解的问题，提出基于知识引导的机器学习方法。

Method: 通过构建一个多阶段集成框架，利用输入的物理知识，学习HJB方程的最优成本到达，并生成最优控制信号。

Result: 该研究提出了一种新的多阶段集成框架，用于最优控制系统设计。通过不依赖于稳定化项，该框架利用哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼（HJB）方程学习最优成本和控制信号。该方法在针对具有噪声和扰动的系统状态以及不同初始条件的非线性系统的闭环控制中显示了成功。

Conclusion: 该框架为非线性控制系统设计提供了一种有效的方法，通过学习最优控制信号实现了稳健的闭环控制。

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Conclusion: 通过全面建模系统及相关信号和任务，提供有效和安全操作多个AUV的解决方案，对水下隐蔽通信任务具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为P-GAP的快速细调大语言模型的方法，通过零阶优化和投影梯度对齐扰动，显著提升了细调效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于梯度的方法在内存占用上较大，而零阶优化方法虽然降低了内存需求，但面临收敛慢和性能不佳的问题，因此需要一种新的细调方案。

Method: 通过构建低维梯度空间并在该空间内对扰动进行投影对齐，从而降低了扰动参数的数量和梯度估计的方差。

Result: P-GAP在分类任务和生成任务上均取得了更高的准确性，同时显著减少了训练迭代次数和所需的GPU时间。

Conclusion: P-GAP方法在多项任务上超越了传统方法，实现了更高的准确率和更少的训练资源消耗。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Result: ACTG算法在合成文本质量上提升20% MAUVE，并在强隐私保障下增强了条件生成控制。

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL算法在差分隐私合成文本质量和条件生成的控制能力上均有显著提升。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for

concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为RULE的框架，为应对双层噪声对应问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Conclusion: 本文的Customized-GRPO框架通过创新的奖励塑造和动态加权机制，有效提高了图像生成模型在身份与提示之间的平衡，实验结果验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

Motivation: 探究嵌入维度对变换器模型内部表示质量的影响，特别是在强化学习任务中。

Method: 通过数百次实验，我们分析了注意力权重矩阵的最后一行如何单调编码全局排序，以及所选择的转置如何与编码值的最大相邻差异对齐。

Result: 研究结果提供了定量证据，表明变换器构建结构化内部世界模型，并且模型规模提升了表示质量和最终性能。

Conclusion: 更高的嵌入维度提高了模型的内部表示的可靠性和可解释性，同时加强了结构化内部表示的形成。

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用中，有效的不确定性量化（UQ）对确保机器学习模型的可靠性至关重要，传统EDL在复杂情况中表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 该方法通过预测灵活的Dirichlet分布来扩展EDL，旨在增强不确定性的表达能力。

Result: 本论文提出了灵活证据深度学习（$	extit{F}$-EDL）方法，以解决证据深度学习（EDL）在处理复杂和意外情况时的鲁棒性不足的问题。通过预测灵活的Dirichlet分布，$	extit{F}$-EDL能够更有效地建模不确定性，提高不确定性量化（UQ）的表现。实验证明，相较于传统方法，$	extit{F}$-EDL在多样化的评估设置下，如经典、长尾和噪声分布中展现了其最先进的UQ性能。

Conclusion: $	extit{F}$-EDL方法通过引入灵活的Dirichlet分布改进了不确定性表示，展现出在多种场景下的优越性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法TCCM，用于表格数据的半监督异常检测，具有较好的检测精度和较低的推断成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高异常检测的效率和准确性，特别是在高维数据中。

Method: 通过时间条件收缩向量预测简化流匹配，避免了在训练和推理时求解常微分方程。

Result: TCCM在ADBench基准上的实验表明，它在检测准确性和推断成本之间取得了良好的平衡。

Conclusion: TCCM在高维和大规模数据集上表现优异，比现有最先进的方法更具优势。

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

Motivation: 传统的策略梯度理论多基于折扣奖励设定，而如今的大规模语言模型强化学习却依赖于无折扣策略，亟需新的理论分析框架。

Result: 本论文分析了经典策略梯度方法在无折扣情况下的表现，针对大规模语言模型的策略基础强化学习提出了新的理论。主要探讨了在无限时间范围内的MDP中，如何处理无折扣总奖励的问题，并提出了两大关键见解，分别是MDP状态的分类不受政策影响，以及引入新的状态访问度量来替代经典的状态访问度量。

Conclusion: 通过新引入的瞬态访问度量，本文为无折扣期望总奖励的强化学习理论提供了新的分析框架。

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Conclusion: 提出的GraphRTA框架在无监督开放集图领域适应任务中具有良好的性能，能够有效区分已知类和未知类。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新的弱监督学习方法，利用n元组中的计数信息来改善模型性能，并提供了理论支持和实践稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在充分利用弱监督学习中的n元组计数信息，解决因标签不足而带来的学习挑战，细化模型的预测能力。

Method: 研究通过构建无偏风险估计器（URE）来利用n元组计数信息，推导并扩展URE的应用，以适应不同元组大小和计数。

Result: 本研究探讨了一种弱监督学习设置，其中每个训练样本是一个包含m个正样本的n元组，但仅观察到每个元组的数量m。我们建立了一个可训练的无偏风险估计器（URE），通过将元组生成过程与潜在实例边际联系起来。我们推导出固定(n,m)情况下的URE封闭形式，并扩展到变量元组大小、变量计数及其组合。在有效混合率与类先验分离的条件下，识别是成立的。我们通过Rademacher复杂性建立了泛化界限，并在温和的正则性假设下证明了统计一致性。为了改善有限样本的稳定性，我们引入简单的ReLU修正，保持渐近正确性。在转换为NTMP任务的基准测试中，该方法始终优于代表性的弱监督基线，并在精度-召回和F1权衡中表现良好。它在类先验不平衡和不同元组配置下仍然保持稳健，显示仅凭计数监督可以通过理论基础和实践稳定的目标有效利用。

Conclusion: 通过实证结果，所提出的方法在多个基准测试中超越了传统弱监督学习方法，且在处理类不平衡时表现稳健。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Motivation: 研究高维和多模态无归一化概率分布的高效采样方法，尤其是针对物理系统的Boltzmann分布。

Method: CMT框架采用了变分方法，通过管理KL散度和熵衰减来生成中间分布。

Result: CMT在多个BG基准测试中表现优异，样本有效性提高超过2.5倍，未发生模式崩溃。

Conclusion: CMT方法通过在Kullback-Leibler散度和熵衰减之间施加约束，显著提高了样本有效性，避免了模式崩溃。

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Method: COPPOL是一种基于信条的感知到策略学习方法，集成了无分布的有限样本安全保证，通过语义分割生成经过校准的危险图。

Result: 在两个由卫星数据得出的基准测试中，COPPOL比比较基线提高了多达6倍的危险覆盖率，并实现了近乎完整的不安全区域检测，同时在导航中减少了约50%的危险违规。

Conclusion: COPPOL通过提供更高的危险覆盖率和更低的危险违规率，提高了在安全关键环境中的导航能力，同时对分布变化具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验表明，部分VOROS在医院警报应用中优于传统的分类器排名手段。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的性能度量，即部分VOROS，能够更好地评估医院警报应用中的分类器性能。

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

Conclusion: 提出的T-MTB后门技术在蒸馏过程中成功转移风险，需加强对知识蒸馏过程中安全性的重视。

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

Result: 评估了三种深度学习模型在不同领域中的表现，并发现其各自的优劣势。

Conclusion: 不同模型在负责任的AI评估中表现出权衡，强调多维度评估的重要性。

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Conclusion: HeFS框架在特征选择中表现优越，能有效识别被忽视的重要特征，并在多个领域内提供更好的分类性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

Result: 提出了NSP设置的形式化，使之适合PAC学习分析，但证明了像DFA和布尔公式这样的概念类仍然难以学习

Conclusion: 在NSP设置下，学习DFA等问题在加密假设下是计算上困难的。

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Conclusion: 研究表明，单层线性自注意力模型在表示结构化动力学函数方面存在基本的局限性，而多层模型能够通过预条件梯度下降优化多个目标。

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Conclusion: 我们的模型在多种对话场景下有效预测了发言模式，表明以个体特性为基础的预测方法更具普适性。

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Conclusion: RLLM在服务性能和行为上与传统LLM存在明显差异，某些优化技术能提升系统效率，但也需谨慎应用以免影响准确性。

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

Conclusion: 使用近似的在线策略数据能有效减轻遗忘现象，这是获取效率更高的实践应用。

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Conclusion: M-AUPO在理论上相比于之前的工作，展现了基于子集大小的样本效率提升，是PbRL领域的重要进展。

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Conclusion: 通过增加对合成数据生成过程的关注，STEAM为相关领域的研究提供了一个有效的工具，推动了医疗干预效果分析的发展。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD可作为一个强大的工具，帮助研究人员找到高性能超参数并理解分数微分在优化中的历史依赖性。

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

Result: CAGE方法在W4A4环境下恢复了超过10%的量化导致的损失增加，超过了现有的异常值处理方法。

Conclusion: 曲率感知梯度修正能够缩小当前异常值处理方法带来的性能差距。

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Conclusion: SB-SETM模型在处理在线主题模型方面表现出色，能够有效地识别和合并数据流中的潜在主题，尤其在实际新闻文章数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

Motivation: 研究能够更好地模拟生物学习过程的连续时间神经模型，克服传统算法模型的离散更新和阶段分隔问题。

Method: 构建一个连续时间神经模型，通过理论分析和模拟实验验证学习动态的生物学合理性。

Result: 通过分析和模拟，提出学习依赖于时间重叠的机制，以及突触可塑性时间尺度需要超过刺激持续时间的预测。

Conclusion: 有效的错误驱动学习需要突触可塑性时间尺度显著超过刺激持续时间，这一发现为生物电路中的学习机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

TL;DR: 本研究分析了LRP在Transformer中的有效性，发现双线性传播规则存在问题，并提出了一种改进的方法，显著提高了LRP的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在现代Transformer中Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)的有效性和准确性，以及其实验结果与传统的Leave-One-Out (LOO)特征重要性测量的对比。

Method: 通过理论分析和在线性注意力层的实证测试，比较了不同的相关性传播方法对LOO的对齐度。

Result: 证明了最新的AttnLRP中使用的双线性传播规则违反了实现不变性公理，并通过实验证实了这一点。同时，通过重新审视CP-LRP，发现通过值矩阵反向传播相关性显著提升了与LOO的对齐。

Conclusion: 双线性因子敏感性和softmax传播误差可能共同削弱了LRP在Transformer中逼近LOO的能力。

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种简单的自助在线监督微调(OSFT)范式，提高大型语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过让模型生成自身响应并基于这些自生成数据进行即时微调，来实现高效的训练策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，OSFT在具有挑战性的数学推理任务中表现出色，与强大的强化学习方法相当。

Conclusion: OSFT提供了一种高效且有前景的替代方案，优于更复杂的基于奖励的训练范式。

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Conclusion: 该方法在约束动作空间的环境中表现优越，具有较好的性能和稳定性，验证了纯值基础方法在连续控制任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Method: 提出一个针对个体化风险评估和干预分析的反事实推理框架，结合正规化的预测建模与反事实搜索。

Result: 针对2700多名确诊SARS-CoV-2感染并有心衰病史的个体，模型达到了强的区分性能（AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91），生成了可解释的患者特定反事实。

Conclusion: 反事实推理可以作为优化问题被形式化，提供一种严格、可解释且计算高效的方法，适用于复杂生物医学系统中的个性化推断。

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出了EVER系统，通过边缘计算提升移动MR辅助操作的自动验证精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在验证用户操作时对物理物体与虚拟物体之间不匹配问题的不足。

Method: 采用分割模型和渲染管线，结合阈值策略及交并比（IoU）度量进行自动验证。

Result: 在100毫秒内实现超过90%的验证准确率，同时与未使用自动验证的系统相比，额外的计算资源和能耗很小。

Conclusion: EVER系统在移动混合现实辅助操作中实现了高准确率和快速的自动验证，显著提高了用户操作的效率和体验。

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR)-aided operation overlays digital objects on the physical
world to provide a more immersive and intuitive operation process. A primary
challenge is the precise and fast auto-verification of whether the user follows
MR guidance by comparing frames before and after each operation. The
pre-operation frame includes virtual guiding objects, while the post-operation
frame contains physical counterparts. Existing approaches fall short of
accounting for the discrepancies between physical and virtual objects due to
imperfect 3D modeling or lighting estimation. In this paper, we propose EVER:
an edge-assisted auto-verification system for mobile MR-aided operations.
Unlike traditional frame-based similarity comparisons, EVER leverages the
segmentation model and rendering pipeline adapted to the unique attributes of
frames with physical pieces and those with their virtual counterparts; it
adopts a threshold-based strategy using Intersection over Union (IoU) metrics
for accurate auto-verification. To ensure fast auto-verification and low energy
consumption, EVER offloads compute-intensive tasks to an edge server. Through
comprehensive evaluations of public datasets and custom datasets with practical
implementation, EVER achieves over 90% verification accuracy within 100
milliseconds (significantly faster than average human reaction time of
approximately 273 milliseconds), while consuming only minimal additional
computational resources and energy compared to a system without
auto-verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型预加载框架DeLoad，显著提高了短视频流媒体的用户体验和带宽效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决短视频流媒体中下载任务适应性不足和观看时间预测模型可靠性差的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的预加载框架DeLoad，通过引入动态任务大小和多维观看时间估计方法，优化下载范围决策。

Result: DeLoad在QoE指标上取得了显著改进，并在一个大型商业短视频平台上提高了用户观看时间，同时降低了重缓冲事件和带宽消耗。

Conclusion: DeLoad展示了在预加载策略中动态任务调整和观看时间预测的有效性，能够在商业环境中良好应用。

Abstract: Short video streaming has become a dominant paradigm in digital media,
characterized by rapid swiping interactions and diverse media content. A key
technical challenge is designing an effective preloading strategy that
dynamically selects and prioritizes download tasks from an evolving playlist,
balancing Quality of Experience (QoE) and bandwidth efficiency under practical
commercial constraints. However, real world analysis reveals critical
limitations of existing approaches: (1) insufficient adaptation of download
task sizes to dynamic conditions, and (2) watch time prediction models that are
difficult to deploy reliably at scale. In this paper, we propose DeLoad, a
novel preloading framework that addresses these issues by introducing dynamic
task sizing and a practical, multi dimensional watch time estimation method.
Additionally, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enhanced agent is trained to
optimize the download range decisions adaptively. Extensive evaluations
conducted on an offline testing platform, leveraging massive real world network
data, demonstrate that DeLoad achieves significant improvements in QoE metrics
(34.4% to 87.4% gain). Furthermore, after deployment on a large scale
commercial short video platform, DeLoad has increased overall user watch time
by 0.09% while simultaneously reducing rebuffering events and 3.76% bandwidth
consumption.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种动态资源选择算法PIRA，在短视频平台中优化用户体验(QoE)与成本的平衡，以应对CDN选择中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着短视频平台的用户量增大，如何在经济成本可控的前提下提升视频质量，成为了亟待解决的重要问题。

Method: 通过建立数学模型，将QoE与成本结合，采用控制理论进行CDN资源选择，并引入状态空间剪枝和自适应参数调整以减少计算开销。

Result: PIRA在包含45万用户的实验中，相比于基础线，启动延迟减少2.1%，缓冲时间缩短15.2%，以及单位流量成本降低10%。

Conclusion: PIRA算法在大规模实验中有效提高了用户体验，同时降低了流量成本，证明了其在短视频流媒体中的有效性。

Abstract: In large scale short video platforms, CDN resource selection plays a critical
role in maintaining Quality of Experience (QoE) while controlling escalating
traffic costs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct in the wild
network measurements during video playback in a production short video system.
The results reveal that CDNs delivering higher average QoE often come at
greater financial cost, yet their connection quality fluctuates even within a
single video underscoring a fundamental and dynamic trade off between QoE and
cost. However, the problem of sustaining high QoE under cost constraints
remains insufficiently investigated in the context of CDN selection for short
video streaming. To address this, we propose PIRA, a dynamic resource selection
algorithm that optimizes QoE and cost in real time during video playback. PIRA
formally integrating QoE and cost by a mathematical model, and introduce a
intra video control theoretic CDN resource selection approach which can balance
QoE and cost under network dynamics. To reduce the computation overheads, PIRA
employs state space pruning and adaptive parameter adjustment to efficiently
solve the high dimensional optimization problem. In large scale production
experiments involving 450,000 users over two weeks, PIRA outperforms the
production baseline, achieving a 2.1% reduction in start up delay, 15.2%
shorter rebuffering time, and 10% lower average unit traffic cost,
demonstrating its effectiveness in balancing user experience and financial cost
at scale.

TL;DR: 信息传递方式显著影响公众如何看待和互动大型语言模型，尤其是将其视为‘伙伴’时，增强人们对其心理能力的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公众话语中关于LLMs的信息传递如何塑造人们对这些模型的看法及互动方式。

Method: 通过随机分组让参与者观看不同类型的信息视频，评估其对LLMs心理能力的信念，以及在后续研究中分析其对LLM生成回应的依赖程度。

Result: 观看‘伙伴’视频的参与者更倾向于相信LLMs具有意图和记忆等心理能力，而这是在其他组别参与者中不常见的。后续研究也验证了这些发现，并发现不同信息传递方式对依赖LLM生成的答复有细微影响。

Conclusion: 大众对大型语言模型（LLMs）的看法受到信息传递方式的显著影响，特别是将其视为‘伙伴’的描述会增强人们对其心理能力的信任。

Abstract: How does messaging about about large language models (LLMs) in public
discourse influence the way people think about and interact with these models?
To answer this question, we randomly assigned participants (N = 470) to watch a
short informational video presenting LLMs as either machines, tools, or
companions -- or to watch no video. We then assessed how strongly they believed
LLMs to possess various mental capacities, such as the ability have intentions
or remember things. We found that participants who watched the companion video
reported believing that LLMs more fully possessed these capacities than did
participants in other groups. In a follow-up study (N = 604), we replicated
these findings and found nuanced effects on how these videos impact people's
reliance on LLM-generated responses when seeking out factual information.
Together, these studies highlight the impact of messaging about AI -- beyond
technical advances in AI -- to generate broad societal impact.

Conclusion: 本研究为心理健康技术创新提供了实证基础，展示了自然语言交互在心理健康评估中的潜力和局限性。

Abstract: Mental health assessments are of central importance to individuals'
well-being. Conventional assessment methodologies predominantly depend on
clinical interviews and standardised self-report questionnaires. Nevertheless,
the efficacy of these methodologies is frequently impeded by factors such as
subjectivity, recall bias, and accessibility issues. Furthermore, concerns
regarding bias and privacy may result in misreporting in data collected through
self-reporting in mental health research. The present study examined the design
opportunities and challenges inherent in the development of a mental health
assessment tool based on natural language interaction with large language
models (LLMs). An interactive prototype system was developed using
conversational AI for non-invasive mental health assessment, and was evaluated
through semi-structured interviews with 11 mental health professionals (six
counsellors and five psychiatrists). The analysis identified key design
considerations for future development, highlighting how AI-driven adaptive
questioning could potentially enhance the reliability of self-reported data
while identifying critical challenges, including privacy protection,
algorithmic bias, and cross-cultural applicability. This study provides an
empirical foundation for mental health technology innovation by demonstrating
the potential and limitations of natural language interaction in mental health
assessment.

Result: 在使用圣保罗的真实数据验证中，展示了该方法如何增强探索和分析任务的能力.

Conclusion: 我们的可视化工具通过用户研究验证，有效提升了城市数据的探索与分析能力，并为未来的交互系统提供了指导.

Abstract: We propose two novel interaction techniques for visualization-assisted
exploration of urban data: Layer Toggling and Visibility-Preserving Lenses.
Layer Toggling mitigates visual overload by organizing information into
separate layers while enabling comparisons through controlled overlays. This
technique supports focused analysis without losing spatial context and allows
users to switch layers using a dedicated button. Visibility-Preserving Lenses
adapt their size and transparency dynamically, enabling detailed inspection of
dense spatial regions and temporal attributes. These techniques facilitate
urban data exploration and improve prediction. Understanding complex phenomena
related to crime, mobility, and residents' behavior is crucial for informed
urban planning. Yet navigating such data often causes cognitive overload and
visual clutter due to overlapping layers. We validate our visualization tool
through a user study measuring performance, cognitive load, and interaction
efficiency. Using real-world data from Sao Paulo, we demonstrate how our
approach enhances exploratory and analytical tasks and provides guidelines for
future interactive systems.

Abstract: As generative AI (genAI) rapidly enters classrooms, accompanied by
district-level policy rollouts and industry-led teacher trainings, it is
important to rethink the canonical ``adopt and train'' playbook. Decades of
educational technology research show that tools promising personalization and
access often deepen inequities due to uneven resources, training, and
institutional support. Against this backdrop, we conducted semi-structured
interviews with 22 teachers from a large U.S. school district that was an early
adopter of genAI. Our findings reveal the motivations driving adoption, the
factors underlying resistance, and the boundaries teachers negotiate to align
genAI use with their values. We further contribute by unpacking the
sociotechnical dynamics -- including district policies, professional norms, and
relational commitments -- that shape how teachers navigate the promises and
risks of these tools.

Result: 开发了DisViz工具，采用新的指令布局方式，并提供与源代码的动态链接。

Conclusion: 我们的新集成视图有助于应用开发者理解和导航反汇编代码，提高了编译优化的假设能力。

Abstract: In applications where efficiency is critical, developers may examine their
compiled binaries, seeking to understand how the compiler transformed their
source code and what performance implications that transformation may have.
This analysis is challenging due to the vast number of disassembled binary
instructions and the many-to-many mappings between them and the source code.
These problems are exacerbated as source code size increases, giving the
compiler more freedom to map and disperse binary instructions across the
disassembly space. Interfaces for disassembly typically display instructions as
an unstructured listing or sacrifice the order of execution. We design a new
visual interface for disassembly code that combines execution order with
control flow structure, enabling analysts to both trace through code and
identify familiar aspects of the computation. Central to our approach is a
novel layout of instructions grouped into basic blocks that displays a looping
structure in an intuitive way. We add to this disassembly representation a
unique block-based mini-map that leverages our layout and shows context across
thousands of disassembly instructions. Finally, we embed our disassembly
visualization in a web-based tool, DisViz, which adds dynamic linking with
source code across the entire application. DizViz was developed in
collaboration with program analysis experts following design study methodology
and was validated through evaluation sessions with ten participants from four
institutions. Participants successfully completed the evaluation tasks,
hypothesized about compiler optimizations, and noted the utility of our new
disassembly view. Our evaluation suggests that our new integrated view helps
application developers in understanding and navigating disassembly code.

Result: 提供了适应不同条件的Minecraft学习方案，包括八个与课程对齐的世界，支持教师和学生的使用。

Conclusion: 提出了一种针对孟加拉国学校的Minecraft教育版实施框架，以应对资源有限的环境，促进游戏基础学习。

Abstract: Game-based learning shows real promise for engaging students in well-funded
schools, but what about everyone else? We propose a practical framework for
implementing Minecraft Education Edition in Bangladesh's 130,000 schools where
55 percent lack reliable internet, rural areas experience 12-16 hour daily
power availability, only 8 percent of rural schools have computer access, and
student-teacher ratios reach 52:1. Our approach tackles these constraints
head-on with three deployment tiers: cloud-based multiplayer for urban schools
with stable infrastructure (15 percent), local area network solutions with
solar power for semi-urban contexts (30 percent), and offline turn-based modes
using refurbished hardware for rural settings (55 percent). We provide eight
pre-built curriculum-aligned worlds with complete Bangla localization covering
topics from Lalbagh Fort reconstruction to monsoon flood simulation. The
interface accommodates first-time users through progressive complexity,
culturally familiar metaphors using local farming and architecture, and
accessibility features including keyboard-only controls and 200 percent text
scaling. Teacher training spans 48 hours across digital literacy, pedagogical
integration, and content creation. We detail evaluation protocols with specific
benchmarks: 15 percent learning gains, 70 percent transfer task mastery, System
Usability Scale scores above 70, and sub-two-dollar cost per student-hour. This
framework has not been empirically validated; it synthesizes game-based
learning theory, HCI principles, and contextual analysis to provide
implementable specifications for pilot testing in resource-constrained
settings.

Motivation: 探讨控制器的虚拟表现形式在MR和VR环境中对目标获取性能的影响，以改善用户体验和性能。

Method: 通过实验比较四种视觉配置对目标选择任务的影响，包括虚拟控制器、虚拟手、控制器和手的组合以及无表现形式。

Result: 在VR和MR中，参与者的表现相当，切换两者不影响基本任务的执行，但现实模仿的控制器提高了表现，导致参与者在MR中对表现的感知有所不同。

Conclusion: 在混合现实(MR)和虚拟现实(VR)上下文中，控制器的虚拟表现形式会影响目标获取的表现，现实模仿的控制器表现形式提高了两者的表现，但参与者在MR中的表现感知不同，提示对MR设计需考虑独特的空间意识需求。

Abstract: We present an experiment exploring how the controller's virtual

the hand, and neither representation. We found performance comparable between
VR and MR, and switching between them did not impact the user's ability to
perform basic tasks. Controller representations mimicking reality enhanced
performance across both modes. However, users perceived performance differently
in MR, indicating the need for unique MR design considerations, particularly
regarding spatial awareness.

Abstract: Modern socio-technical systems are characterized by strategic coopetition
where actors simultaneously cooperate to create value and compete to capture
it. While conceptual modeling languages like i* provide rich qualitative
representations of strategic dependencies, they lack mechanisms for
quantitative analysis of dynamic trade-offs. Conversely, classical game theory
offers mathematical rigor but strips away contextual richness. This technical
report bridges this gap by developing computational foundations that formalize
two critical dimensions of coopetition: interdependence and complementarity. We
ground interdependence in i* structural dependency analysis, translating
depender-dependee-dependum relationships into quantitative interdependence
coefficients through a structured translation framework. We formalize
complementarity following Brandenburger and Nalebuff's Added Value concept,
modeling synergistic value creation with validated parameterization. We
integrate structural dependencies with bargaining power in value appropriation
and introduce a game-theoretic formulation where Nash Equilibrium incorporates
structural interdependence. Validation combines comprehensive experimental
testing across power and logarithmic value function specifications,
demonstrating functional form robustness, with empirical application to the
Samsung-Sony S-LCD joint venture (2004-2011), where logarithmic specifications
achieve superior empirical fit (validation score 45/60) while power functions
provide theoretical tractability. This technical report serves as the
foundational reference for a coordinated research program examining strategic
coopetition in requirements engineering and multi-agent systems, with companion
work addressing trust dynamics, team production, and reciprocity mechanisms.
