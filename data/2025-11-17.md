### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究AI系统能力增长的条件，提出一种框架以测试和控制AI奇点的可能性，以及分析所需的资本、数据和能量对能力提升的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在何种可测量条件下，AI能力会在有限时间内无限增长，以及在何种条件下这一现象可以被排除。

Method: 通过递归自我改进的解析框架，建立能力增长与资源配置政策之间的联系，利用物理和信息论的限制定义服务范围。

Result: 发展了可观察的决策规则，将设施电力、IO带宽、训练吞吐量等指标映射为AI能力增长的行为证书。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种框架，通过可测试的条件和可实施的控制措施，来认证或阻止AI奇点的发生。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种分层缓存策略HGC，以提高可控生成模型的生成效率并保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可控生成模型在控制条件与内容生成计算需求之间的生成效率问题。

Method: 采用粗粒度缓存和细粒度缓存策略，对模型推理过程中的冗余计算进行动态跳过和特征重用。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证HGC的有效性，特别是在生成效率与视觉质量之间达成良好平衡。

Conclusion: HGC方法能有效提高可控生成模型的生成效率，减少计算开销，同时保持视觉质量。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术的程序变异性、学习曲线艰难以及相关并发症影响了手术质量与结果，因此需要一种标准化的工具来优化培训和改善手术表现。

Method: 通过德尔菲过程达成关于可推广工作流程描述符的共识，开发新的视频基础分析工具ColoWorkflow，并将其应用于多中心的手术视频数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow是第一个基于共识的验证视频评估工具，能够全面分析微创结直肠手术的工作流程，有助于标准化培训和提升手术质量。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM在微表情识别任务中通过多专家解耦，实现了运动语义的对齐，展示了优越的性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: PhaseWin是一种新的相位窗口搜索算法，能够实现高效可靠的区域归因，建立了多模态模型归因的新标准。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

Conclusion: 本文提出的积极与消极提示监督方法在OOD检测中显著优于现有基准。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Hi-DREAM通过将条件处理结构化为皮层层次，为视觉皮层的研究提供了有力工具，并在语义和低级图像质量上实现了先进性能。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD) 和 Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) 提高了异构知识蒸馏的效果，通过共享对数和正交损失实现了多样化知识的有效传递，最终在多个数据集上超越了传统的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

TL;DR: ERMoE 是一种新的稀疏专家变压器，通过特征基评分方法解决了路由不稳定和专家负载不均的问题，实现了更高的模型准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts 模型面临路由不稳定和专家利用不足的问题，以及负载不均衡导致的瓶颈，现有解决方案往往削弱专家的专业化和下游性能。因此，迫切需要一种新的方法来平衡负载和提高专家的利用效率。

Method: ERMoE 使用学习的正交特征基对每个专家进行重参数化，并用“特征基评分”替代传统的路由逻辑，利用输入特征与专家基之间的余弦相似度进行路由。

Result: ERMoE 在 ImageNet 分类和跨模态图像-文本检索基准（如 COCO，Flickr30K）上达到最佳准确率，并显著改善大脑年龄预测的准确性，同时生成更平坦的专家负载分布。

Conclusion: ERMoE 提出了一个新的稀疏专家模型架构，解决了路由不稳定性问题，并在保持模型稀疏性的同时提高了性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DMC和DMC-OT两个框架，旨在解决CIL中的分类器偏差问题，实验结果显示其在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CIL中逐步学习新类别带来的分类器偏差问题，特别是文本原型在缺少先前数据时会过拟合新类别。

Method: 提出了DMC框架，分为两个阶段，即视觉编码器适应和文本软提示优化，每个阶段训练时另一个被冻结。引入DMC-OT，对类统计进行最佳传输引导校准，以解决用户编码更新产生的分布漂移问题。

Result: DMC和DMC-OT在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200和UCF-101上进行了广泛的实验，表现出最新的技术水平，DMC-OT进一步提高了平均准确率。

Conclusion: DMC和DMC-OT在CIL任务中均表现出色，DMC-OT进一步提升了平均准确率1.80%。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频LLMs存在时间不一致性问题，提出的PAS机制能有效改善该问题，提升了鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大型语言模型在时间一致性方面存在问题，导致关注点和相关帧受到压制。

Method: 提出了一种称为阶段聚合平滑（PAS）的机制，应用小的反向相位偏移并聚合它们的输出。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中，PAS相较于传统方法显示出一致的改进，且计算开销微乎其微。

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种简单的、无需训练的机制，能够增强视频大型语言模型的时间编码鲁棒性，减少时间不一致性。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练-free工作流程，通过量化和二元化方法显著提升了零-shot视觉的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升零-shot视觉任务的处理能力，尤其是在开放式查询的场景中，传统方法性能不足。

Method: 通过两个步骤：量化（将开放式查询转化为多项选择题）和二元化（对每个候选项进行True/False问题的询问），实现了高效的验证方法。

Result: 该工作流程在多个任务上（包括参考表达基础、空间推理和BLINK拼图）实现了显著的性能提升，表明其通用性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种训练无关的二元验证工作流程，可在零-shot视觉任务中使用现成的VLMs。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Motivation: 传统的自回归模型因计算成本高而被认为不实用，本研究旨在重新思考这一范式，探讨其成为高性能实际解决方案的可能性。

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于分层并行性和渐进适应的自回归框架，通过引入层次因子化结构和内容感知卷积门控来高效捕捉空间依赖关系。

Result: 在不同的数据集（自然、卫星、医学）上的实验验证了该方法在压缩效果上达到了新的领先水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在学习无损图像压缩领域设立了新的基准，展现了精心设计的自回归框架可以在较小的参数量和竞争性的编码速度下，提供显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型在医学等特定领域面临数据类型和数量有限的挑战，亟需一种新方法以克服这些限制。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，CLUE使用Style Encoder处理图像和提示，生成风格嵌入，并将其输入U-Net架构的新第二注意力层。

Result: CLUE在中耳炎数据集上的FID降低至9.30，回调率提升至70.29%；训练在仅合成数据上得到F1分数83.21%；合成与真实数据结合的情况下，F1分数为94.76%。

Conclusion: CLUE通过固定格式的提示生成多样且稳定的图像，成为特定领域数据增强的有效方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

Result: PROMISE能够在特定模态缺失的情况下，动态生成稳健且一致的表示，缩小完整数据与不完整数据之间的表示差距。广泛的实验和消融研究表明，PROMISE在基准数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: PROMISE在面对缺失模态的情况下，通过引入多模态提示学习和层次对比学习框架，显著提升了跨模态表示的鲁棒性和一致性，优于现有先进的多模态方法。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统忽视情感维度，缺乏资源将情感理解与生成任务结合，尤其是在风格化和非现实场景中。

Method: 通过引入EmoVid数据集并细化Wan2.1模型，以情感为条件进行视频生成。

Result: 生成的视频在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中的定量指标和视觉质量都有显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算建立了新基准，提供了提高视频生成情感表达的有效方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Result: DnR在VQA和标注基准测试中展现出一致的准确性提升，并降低了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: DnR提高了视觉利用效率，减少了幻觉现象，证明了量化视觉信息的利用对多模态系统的重要性。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

Conclusion: VisMem显著提高了视觉语言模型的性能，通过动态潜在视觉记忆机制，提升了感知保真度和语义一致性，确立了新的潜在空间记忆增强范式。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement.

Conclusion: SP-Guard能够更安全地生成图像，并在降低意外内容改变的同时，强调了图像生成的透明度和可控性的重要性。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Conclusion: SUPER在高频细节恢复和重建一致性方面表现出色，尤其对于窄裂缝和低频图像降噪任务均有显著提升。

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: AirCopBench 为多模态大语言模型在具挑战性的空中协作感知中的评估提供了必要的基准。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Motivation: To improve the accuracy of embryo viability assessment during IVF by leveraging the distributional prior of embryonic development and addressing limitations of existing models.

Method: A two-stage diffusion-based framework using a frame-level encoder for feature extraction and a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy to create a 3D-aware representation.

Result: EmbryoDiff outperforms existing methods with 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating effective classification with a single denoising step.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff framework significantly enhances embryo stage classification accuracy by incorporating multi-focal features and a diffusion-based denoising process, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 本研究表明，深度学习模型从胸部X光片中能够识别出与社会经济地位相关的隐性信号，突破了医学影像的中立性假设，需重新检视医疗AI的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨医学影像中潜藏的社会经济地位指示，及其对医疗AI公平性影响的认识。

Method: 使用先进的深度学习架构（如DenseNet121、SwinV2-B、MedMamba）分析正常胸部X光片。

Result: 模型能以显著的准确性预测患者的健康保险类型，并在控制年龄、性别和种族后，信号依然显著。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够从医疗影像中识别出社会不平等的隐性痕迹，挑战了医学影像中生物数据中立的假设，并提出需重新审视医疗AI公平性的概念。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

TL;DR: CrossMed基准评估医疗多模态大语言模型的组合泛化能力，显示多模态模型在跨任务和零重叠条件下的表现差异，为医疗视觉-语言模型提供了严格的测试平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的快速发展，评估其在医疗领域对未见组合的泛化能力显得尤为重要，因此引入了CrossMed基准。

Method: 通过对四个公共数据集进行重新格式化，将其转化为统一的视觉问答(VQA)格式，从而创建CrossMed基准。

Result: 在相关的数据拆分下，模型的分类精度达到了83.2%，而在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降，从而反映了基准测试的挑战性。传统模型与多模态大语言模型在组合泛化能力上的性能差异也得以体现。

Conclusion: CrossMed是一个旨在评估医疗多模态大语言模型的组合泛化能力的基准，通过结构化的模态-解剖-任务(MAT)框架展示了在零重叠和跨任务分析下的性能变化。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网的快速发展，在极弱嵌入式设备上集成人工智能以改善实时性能和数据隐私得到了越来越多的关注。

Method: 实验通过在STM32上使用三种模型和六个数据集进行图像分类和目标检测任务，验证了提出的方法。

Result: SemanticNN能够在严格的计算和通信约束下，容忍比特级错误，追求语义级的正确性，并显著减少特征传输量。

Conclusion: SemanticNN在传输错误率变化的情况下，显著减少了特征传输量，同时保持了更高的推理准确性。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了H$^{2}$ARN，一个用于文本-3D检索的新方法，解决了当前方法的主要挑战，并发布了更新的T3DR-HIT v2基准。

Motivation: 应对日益增长的3D数据和当前文本-3D检索方法面临的主要挑战，包括层次表示崩溃(HRC)和冗余引起的显著性稀释(RISD)。

Method: 使用双曲空间中的层次排序损失和实例对比损失，以增强匹配3D实例和文本之间的联系，同时提出一种贡献感知的双曲聚合模块来减少冗余。

Result: H$^{2}$ARN方法提高了文本-3D检索的精确性，并增强了模型对复杂文本-3D对的区分能力，同时推出的新基准提供了更丰富的训练和评估数据。

Conclusion: H$^{2}$ARN通过在洛伦兹模型的双曲空间中嵌入文本和3D数据，成功解决了文本-3D检索中的HRC和RISD问题，并推出了扩展的T3DR-HIT v2基准。

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Conclusion: PINGS-X显著减少了训练时间，同时实现了优越的超分辨率准确性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的LoRA融合框架NP-LoRA，通过正交投影减少结构干扰，提高融合质量，且不需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA融合方法依赖于基于权重的合并，容易导致干扰及保真度降低，需解决结构性干扰问题。

Method: 通过奇异值分解提取主要风格方向，并将主题LoRA投影到其正交空间，另外引入了软投影机制以平衡主题保真度和风格一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NP-LoRA在强基线（如DINO和基于CLIP的指标）上展现了更好的融合质量，获得了人类和LLM的偏好评分。

Conclusion: NP-LoRA显著提高了LoRA融合的质量，且广泛适用于不同的基础模型和LoRA对，无需重新训练。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Motivation: 现有图像合成方法在保持细节和调整前景姿态/视角方面存在困难，因此需要改进。

Method: 扩展现有生成合成模型为多参考版本，校准前景参考图像的全局和局部特征，以便与背景信息兼容。

Result: 在MVImgNet和MureCom数据集上的大量实验表明，生成模型可以从校准的参考特征中受益匪浅。

Conclusion: 经过校准的参考特征显著提高了生成模型在图像合成任务中的表现。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有加速方法在动态估计稀疏注意力模式时面临高计算开销和估计错误的权衡，LiteAttention旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出LiteAttention方法，该方法通过早期标记非必要 tiles，并向前传播跳过决策，从而消除冗余的注意力计算。

Result: 在实际视频扩散模型中，LiteAttention显示了显著的加速效果，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: LiteAttention方法通过利用扩散注意力的时序一致性，在视频生成中实现了显著的速度提升，而不损失质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Conclusion: 提出的\textsc{S2D-Align}方法在多模态生成任务中，实现了更优的解剖学对齐，显著提高了报告生成的质量。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多模态形状完成任务中表现最佳，而自回归模型在离散潜空间中也展现出强劲的表现。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Conclusion: SaTformer模型在NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025挑战中取得了第一名，表明其在极端降水预测方面的有效性。

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT为CAC检测提供了精确的地面真相标记，但成本高且不适合大规模筛查，因此需要一种替代方案。

Method: 使用COCA数据集中的667个CT扫描生成合成DRRs，评估模型能力、超分辨率增强、预处理和训练策略。

Result: 在最佳配置下，模型的平均AUC达到0.754，与或超过之前基于CXR的研究相当。

Conclusion: DRRs作为一种可扩展的、标签丰富的CAC检测基础，为未来在真实CXRs中的迁移学习和领域适应奠定了基础。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Conclusion: 本研究建议采用多模态深度学习模型，以提高对生成媒体的检测能力，并为未来研究提供了明确的起点。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新颖的大型矢量汉字模型（LVGM），能够通过预测下一笔划生成矢量化的汉字，并构建了一个包含907,267个样本的新数据集，以支持该模型的训练和验证。

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Motivation: 现有的知识基础视觉问答方法的推理过程缺乏显式的多步轨迹，亟需一种新的方法来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出了Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)框架，通过冷冻的7B规模多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）生成Hindsight-Zero训练数据，结合Chain-of-Thought生成器和知识生成器进行自我蒸馏。

Result: HinD在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上展现出卓越的表现，证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: HinD框架通过知识鼓励偏好优化（KEPO）有效提高了知识基础视觉问答的推理能力，展示了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Method: 本研究提出了一种基于最优传输（OT）理论的图像到图像翻译框架OT-ALD，该框架通过计算源域和目标域之间的OT映射来改善翻译过程。

Result: OT-ALD在四个翻译任务上相较于顶尖基线模型，提高了20.29%的采样效率，平均降低了2.6的FID评分。

Conclusion: OT-ALD框架有效平衡了更快的图像翻译和更好的图像质量，显著提高了样本效率并降低了FID分数。

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的异常检测方法缺乏对异常类型的区分能力，且需要为每个对象类别训练单独的模型，这在多应用场景中导致了效率低下和高成本。

Method: 提出了一种基于图像级标签的卷积框架，通过多通道热图学习来区分不同类型的异常。

Result: 在 Real-IAD 数据集上的评估显示，MultiTypeFCDD 提供了与最新复杂模型竞争的结果，同时在参数负载和推理时间上显著降低。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD 是一种简单轻量的卷积框架，能够高效地实现可解释的多类型异常检测，适合实际应用且计算资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

Motivation: 解决目前多视角视频重建中因输入视频流不同步导致的时序错位问题。

Result: 在实验中，方法处理时间错位的视频效果显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的时间对齐策略有效处理了时间不对齐的视频，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1模型在视觉语言理解中实现了准确的细粒度理解，并显著提高了效率，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

TL;DR: MAFM^3是一种模块化适应框架，使基础模型能够高效适应多任务和多模态医学影像，提高了性能并减少了对大量数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对医学影像领域数据稀缺的问题，提出一种统一且可扩展的适应框架，以减少为每个特定任务或模态单独构建模型的需求。

Method: 基于已有的胸部CT基础模型，以模块化的方式扩展至预后和分割任务，验证各模块的性能。

Result: 通过MAFM^3框架，胸部CT基础模型在预后和分割任务上均表现出更好的性能，Dice得分较基线提升了5%。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: 结合视频扩散模型的指导分数蒸馏方法，提升3D高斯点云表示的性能，解决稀疏视图导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在稀疏训练视图输入下易于过拟合，缺少中间视图监督，因此需要新的方法来改进其性能。

Method: 提出了一种名为指导分数蒸馏（GSD）的框架，利用视频扩散模型（VDM）提取多视角一致性先验，并引入深度扭曲引导和语义图像特征引导。

Result: 通过引导高斯点云表示朝向VDM生成方向，解决了由于目标运动和随机相机轨迹导致的优化监督问题。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在多个数据集上优于现有的方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Result: 实验表明，文本编码器倾向于在输入开头表现出偏置，而图像编码器在开头和结尾均表现出偏置。

Conclusion: 多模态表征模型中存在显著的位置信息偏置，对模型性能产生负面影响。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze 提供了一种优越的生成合成训练数据的方法，设定了新的状态-of-the-art，并减少了注视误差。

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Motivation: 现有的数据集规模有限以及多源点云的高异质性限制了3D深度学习的泛化能力，特别是在不同传感器收集的数据之间存在显著差异。

Method: 提出了一种名为DoReMi的混合专家框架，结合领域感知专家分支与统一表征分支，通过领域引导的空间路由和熵控制动态分配实现协同学习。

Result: DoReMi在3D理解基准中显示了优越的性能，尤其是在ScanNet Val和S3DIS数据集上，通过动态激活域感知专家分支和稳定利用专家，改善了跨域学习的效果。

Conclusion: DoReMi在多个3D理解基准上表现出色，尤其在ScanNet Val和S3DIS数据集上分别达到了80.1%和77.2%的mIoU，展现了其作为未来3D理解研究基础框架的强大潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Result: 使用CountSteer方法，物体计数的准确性提高了约4%。

Conclusion: CountSteer方法在不影响视觉质量的前提下，提升了物体计数准确性，展示了文本到图像生成的可控性和语义可靠性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Conclusion: CORAL通过引入协调学习框架，提高了在有限标注下的体积医学图像分割性能，并生成了具有意义的解剖结构表示。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Motivation: 在计算机视觉应用中，模型在图像背景、风格和获取工具的变化下，表现出下降，现有的增强方法（通用的和数据集特定的）不足以解决这一问题。

Method: 通过在幅度空间和像素空间引入有针对性的增强，使用任务梯度计算频率空间的敏感性图，来适应性插值源样本和目标样本之间的幅度。

Conclusion: D-GAP在改善OOD鲁棒性方面表现优异，超越了传统和数据集特定的增强方法。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Result: AUVIC框架在首次评估视觉概念遗忘的基准数据集VCUBench上展现出卓越的性能。

Conclusion: AUVIC框架在视觉概念遗忘上实现了最先进的目标遗忘率，同时对非目标概念的性能影响最小。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 由于事件相机在计算机视觉中的应用逐渐增长，而目前在此领域的合成数据相对匮乏，因此构建 YCB-Ev SD 数据集以满足 6DoF 物体姿态估计的需求。

Method: 采用物理基础渲染（PBR）场景合成 50,000 个事件序列，结合模拟线性相机运动以确保场景覆盖，并基于 CNN 的推理方法进行事件表示的系统评估。

Result: 展示了时间表面与线性衰减双通道极性编码的显著性能提升，尤其是极性信息对性能提升的贡献较大，而线性时间编码比指数衰减更有效保留关键运动信息。

Conclusion: YCB-Ev SD 数据集为 6DoF 物体姿态估计提供了重要资源，通过事件表示的系统评估，展示了时间表面与线性衰减的双通道极性编码在姿态估计上的优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的3D人类运动生成模型在重建精度方面表现优异，但在训练分布之外的泛化能力不足，主要由于过于依赖精确的3D监督。

Method: 引入了一种运动提升残差量化变分自编码器(ML-RQ)，将2D运动序列映射到3D一致的潜在空间，利用一系列不依赖于3D的正则化目标以强化视角一致性、方向一致性和物理可行性。

Result: Free3D框架在完全使用2D运动数据的情况下，生成的3D运动在多样性、时间一致性和语义一致性方面达到或超过了完全3D监督的模型。

Conclusion: Free3D框架通过放宽3D监督的限制，成功地生成了多样化且语义一致的3D运动，提供了一种可扩展和高效的数据生成方法。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

Conclusion: LSEF显著增强了模型的鲁棒性和动态区分能力，验证了分层低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态中的有效性和普遍性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Motivation: 解决在类增量学习中应用CLIP时的适应性问题和视觉文本模态整合不足问题。

Method: 采用Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion机制，对CLIP的交叉模态桥接层进行适应性调整，限制参数更新在低秩安全子空间内。

Result: BOFA在标准基准测试上实现了优于现有方法的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: BOFA框架在类增量学习中实现了更高的准确性和效率，能够有效整合视觉和文本模态，避免遗忘问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了自适应教学范式，有效缩小视觉和脑电图之间的差距，达到60.2%的准确率，超越了之前的方法。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Result: 实验表明，WEAVE-100k的训练改善了视觉理解、图像编辑和理解-生成协作能力，并促进了视觉记忆能力的发展。

Conclusion: WEAVE为多模态社区提供了研究上下文交错理解和生成的基础，强调了在多轮、情境感知的图像生成和编辑中存在的持续局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [88] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆与普遍化之间的关系，提出了一种新的评估框架，发现模型的表现不仅展示了对文化参考的识别，也表现在其转化和再语境化能力上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文旨在解决文本到图像扩散模型中普遍化与记忆之间的模糊性，特别关注文化共鸣带来的多模态经典性现象。

Method: 我们提出了一个评估框架，将识别（模型是否识别引用）与实现（模型通过复制或重新诠释如何描绘这些引用）分开量化，通过捕捉这两个维度的测量进行分析。

Result: 我们评估了五个扩散模型，涵盖767个来源于Wikidata的文化引用，结果表明我们的框架比现有相似度方法更有效地区分复制与转化。

Conclusion: 我们的工作揭示了扩散模型的价值不仅在于它们复制了什么，还在于它们如何转化和重新定义文化知识，推动评估方式超越简单的文本-图像匹配，向更丰富的上下文理解发展。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

TL;DR: VP-Bench是一个评估多模态大语言模型理解和利用视觉提示能力的新基准，采用两阶段评估方法，分析了多个模型的表现及影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前没有系统评估多模态大语言模型对视觉提示的理解能力，导致其是否能有效识别视觉提示并解决问题不明确。

Method: VP-Bench采用两阶段评估框架，第一阶段评估模型在自然场景中感知视觉提示的能力，第二阶段评估视觉提示在实际问题解决中的影响。

Result: 使用VP-Bench对28个多模态大语言模型进行了评估，并分析了影响视觉提示理解的多个因素。

Conclusion: VP-Bench提供了一种新的参考框架，用于研究多模态大语言模型理解和解决基于视觉提示的问题的能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

TL;DR: MaMOL框架通过将模态缺失问题视为多任务学习问题，提供了一种高效的多模态分类解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态分类方法在缺失模态情况下的性能下降问题。

Method: 提出了一种双路由机制，包括任务导向的动态路由器和模态特定的共享静态路由器。

Result: 在多个遥感基准测试中表现出更强的鲁棒性和更好的泛化性能，并验证了其在不同缺失率下的有效性。

Conclusion: MaMOL框架为处理缺失模态的多模态分类提供了一种高效且具有广泛适用性的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Bayesian分割框架nnUNet-B，该方法从H&E染色图像直接推断PD-L1表达，具有竞争性能和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确评估PD-L1表达对于指导免疫治疗至关重要，但现有的免疫组化（IHC）方法资源密集。

Method: 基于nnUNet-v2的Bayesian分割框架，采用多模态后验采样（MPS）从H&E染色的组织学图像中推断PD-L1表达。

Result: 在肺鳞状细胞癌数据集上，该方法的平均Dice Score为0.805，平均IoU为0.709，展示了与确立基线的竞争性性能，并提供了逐像素的不确定性地图。

Conclusion: 不确定性意识的H&E基础PD-L1预测为临床工作流中的可扩展、可解释生物标志物评估迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了大型视觉语言模型在对象幻觉中的弱图像依赖性，并提出了一种新的实时检测信号，预备注意力分数(PAS)，实现了前所未有的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)强大，但由于对象幻觉问题，它们仍然不可靠，因此需要探究其原因和检测方法。

Method: 通过量化图像与预测对象之间的互信息，并引入了一种新信号——预备注意力分数(PAS)，来检测对象幻觉。

Result: 通过消耗预备生成的输出（prelim）token，LVLM在许多幻觉预测中有效忽略图像，因此提出的PAS可以实时监测这一现象，优化LVLM的可靠性。

Conclusion: 引入的预备注意力分数(PAS)在多种模型和数据集中实现了最新的对象幻觉检测状态，能够进行实时过滤和干预。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于超声图像解释高度依赖操作员且受多种因素影响，缺乏通用的、标签高效的深度学习模型，推动了本研究的开展。

Method: 通过结合对比学习和掩码图像建模的新型自适应掩码框架进行预训练，并采用动态学习计划逐步调整预训练过程的难度。

Conclusion: OpenUS是第一个基于大量公开数据构建的可重复使用的开源超声基础模型，能有效提升超声图像分析的通用性和效率。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过早期或晚期融合处理图像与自然语言的对齐，而两种模态的隐藏状态已经携带丰富的模态特定结构，因此直接对齐这些状态是自然且有效的匹配方式。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的融合模块，包括几个仅跨模态的双向注意力层，位于两个编码器的顶部，能够投影视觉和文本编码器的隐藏状态序列到共享空间，并进行跨模态注意。

Result: 实验表明，BRIDGE在多个基准任务上表现优越，同时保持了对比模型的效率。

Conclusion: BRIDGE模型在标准检索、视觉问答和视觉推理基准上超越了可比的视觉语言模型，同时保留了对比模型的双编码器效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Result: 生成的报告质量较高，得分显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过采用分解任务的方法，我们提出的系统显著提高了分析报告的质量，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Data analysis and performance evaluation of simulation deduction plays a pivotal role in modern warfare, which enables military personnel to gain invaluable insights into the potential effectiveness of different strategies, tactics, and operational plans. Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the reports generated by our method exhibit higher quality, therefore obtaining higher scores than the baseline method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges faced by dialogue models in noisy, multi-speaker environments, such as irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking.

Method: The framework uses acoustic tokenization and multi-task, multi-stage training on various audio-visual dialogue datasets.

Result: AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models, reducing transcription errors and improving turn-taking prediction and overall dialogue quality.

Conclusion: AV-Dialog demonstrates significant improvements in dialogue quality and interaction in noisy environments by utilizing multimodal cues.

Abstract: Dialogue models falter in noisy, multi-speaker environments, often producing irrelevant responses and awkward turn-taking. We present AV-Dialog, the first multimodal dialog framework that uses both audio and visual cues to track the target speaker, predict turn-taking, and generate coherent responses. By combining acoustic tokenization with multi-task, multi-stage training on monadic, synthetic, and real audio-visual dialogue datasets, AV-Dialog achieves robust streaming transcription, semantically grounded turn-boundary detection and accurate responses, resulting in a natural conversational flow. Experiments show that AV-Dialog outperforms audio-only models under interference, reducing transcription errors, improving turn-taking prediction, and enhancing human-rated dialogue quality. These results highlight the power of seeing as well as hearing for speaker-aware interaction, paving the way for {spoken} dialogue agents that perform {robustly} in real-world, noisy environments.

Conclusion: 该系统在提升对话生成的深度与响应速度方面表现出色，并适用于资源受限的环境，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models show promise for embodying historical characters in dialogue systems, but existing approaches face a critical trade-off: simple retrieval-augmented generation produces shallow responses, while multi-stage reflection achieves depth at prohibitive latency. We present an architecture that resolves this tension through offline data augmentation and efficient parallel retrieval from structured episodic memory. Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis. We use Van Gogh as a test case, but the architecture is generalizable to any historical figure with substantial textual records, offering a practical framework for educational, museum, and research applications requiring both accuracy and efficiency

Result: 实验结果显示，使用最少的量子比特（10个量子比特和80个量子门）可以替代150M参数模型中约10%的经典参数，同时保持相当的收敛稳定性和生成质量。

Conclusion: 本研究首次展示了量子计算与大规模生成语言模型的集成可行性。

Abstract: Although quantum computing has been increasingly applied to replace classical computation, most existing quantum or hybrid models remain confined to simple tasks, with no successful application to large-scale natural language generation to date. In this work, we present the first hybrid quantum-classical large language model (LLM) for natural language generation, HyQuT, capable of performing coherent and context-aware dialogue. The proposed architecture integrates variational quantum circuits (VQCs) into the Transformer framework at both 8M and 150M parameter scales. Experimental results show that a minimal number of qubits (10 qubits with 80 quantum gates) can replace about 10% of the classical parameters in the 150M-parameter model, while achieving comparable convergence stability and generation quality. This study provides an early demonstration of the feasibility of integrating quantum computing to large-scale generative language models.

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了高达3.8%的准确性提升，改进了对对抗案例的泛化能力，降低了推理噪声。

Conclusion: 通过引入语义增强的预处理步骤，改进了Spectral NSR框架的图质量，使其更强大、可解释且可扩展。

Abstract: This report extends the Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning (Spectral NSR) framework by introducing three semantically grounded enhancements: (1) transformer-based node merging using contextual embeddings (e.g., Sentence-BERT, SimCSE) to reduce redundancy, (2) sentence-level entailment validation with pretrained NLI classifiers (e.g., RoBERTa, DeBERTa) to improve edge quality, and (3) alignment with external knowledge graphs (e.g., ConceptNet, Wikidata) to augment missing context. These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine. The result is a more robust, interpretable, and scalable reasoning system suitable for deployment in open-domain and real-world settings.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的PReference Orchestrator框架在多目标对齐方面表现出色，证明了动态调整偏好权重的有效性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse natural language processing tasks, aligning these models with varying human preferences across multiple objectives remains a significant challenge in practical deployments. Existing multi-objective alignment methods rely on manually specified preference weights, which not only burden users with difficult preference specification tasks but also lead to suboptimal training efficiency due to exploration of irrelevant preference combinations. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel framework named PRO, i.e., PReference Orchestrator, which features a lightweight preference adapter that automatically infers prompt-specific preference weights during both training and deployment phases. Specifically, the adapter automatically learns appropriate preference weights for each prompt by training on normalized reward scores from multiple reward models for preferred responses, which inherently reflect effective preference balances across objectives. Additionally, We provide theoretical analysis proving that our prompt-aware preference mechanism achieves superior performance compared to fixed preference weights in multi-objective alignment scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over existing multi-objective alignment approaches.

Motivation: 为了提高复杂任务的推理和准确性，同时应对传统MAD的计算成本和准确性问题。

Method: iMAD通过提取41个可解释的语言和语义特征，使用轻量级的辩论决策分类器，决定是否触发MAD。

Result: iMAD在六个视觉问答数据集上的实验中，令牌使用量最多减少了92%，最后答案的准确性提高了最多13.5%。

Conclusion: iMAD显著降低了令牌使用量，同时提升了最终答案的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agent systems have advanced rapidly, driven by their strong generalization in zero-shot settings. To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).

Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework for learning patent embeddings by leveraging multiple views from within the same document. We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations. Our analysis further shows that different sections specialize for different tasks-claims and summaries benefit retrieval, while background sections aid classification-highlighting the value of patents' inherent discourse structure for representation learning. These results highlight the value of exploiting intra-document views for scalable and generalizable patent understanding.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了人工智能是否能够学习人类语音中的礼貌特征，结果表明AI可以通过调整语速来表达礼貌，显示出其在社会交流中的新兴角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查最先进的文本转语音系统是否内化了人类降低语速以传达礼貌的倾向，探索非显性韵律标记的学习能力。

Method: 对来自两个领先AI平台（AI Studio和OpenAI）的22个合成声音在“礼貌和正式”以及“随意和非正式”条件下朗读固定脚本进行测试，并测量语音持续时间。

Result: 在两个AI平台中，礼貌提示产生的语速比随意提示慢，效果显著且效果量很大，所有AI Studio的声音均显示出统计学显著性，大多数OpenAI的声音也如此。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，人工智能能够隐性学习和复制人类交流中的心理细微差别，凸显其作为社会参与者的日益重要角色。

Abstract: Voice-based artificial intelligence is increasingly expected to adhere to human social conventions, but can it learn implicit cues that are not explicitly programmed? This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both "polite and formal" and "casual and informal" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices. These results demonstrate that AI can implicitly learn and replicate psychological nuances of human communication, highlighting its emerging role as a social actor capable of reinforcing human social norms.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在临床记录的信息提取中的应用日益增加，研究旨在填补以往只关注单一任务和有限模型的空白。

Method: 评估15个开放权重的LLM在六个使用案例上的表现，比较了多种模型和六种提示策略，并使用合适的指标进行性能评估。

Result: 顶级模型在任务间达成了一致的宏平均得分，小型到中型通用模型的表现与大型模型相当，而小型和专业模型的表现较差。提示图和少量提示提高了约13%的性能，任务特定因素对结果的影响大于模型大小或提示策略。

Conclusion: 开放权重的大型语言模型可以从临床报告中提取结构化数据，适用于多种疾病、语言和机构，为临床数据整理提供了一种可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract structured information from free-text clinical records, but prior work often focuses on single tasks, limited models, and English-language reports. We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%. Task-specific factors, including variable complexity and annotation variability, influenced results more than model size or prompting strategy. These findings show that open-weight LLMs can extract structured data from clinical reports across diseases, languages, and institutions, offering a scalable approach for clinical data curation.

Motivation: 在数据快速增长的时代，lossless压缩技术日益重要，传统压缩工具的压缩率不足以满足需求，而现代神经压缩器在未见数据上的泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出了一种通过加权专家产品（wPoE）实现测试时指导的新框架，结合了通用压缩模型和预训练的神经语言模型。

Result: 通过广泛的实验验证，该方法在提高文本压缩性能的同时，确保压缩率至少与最优单一模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在文本压缩性能上取得了显著提升，且无需微调即可与任何自回归语言模型无缝集成。

Abstract: Lossless compression techniques are crucial in an era of rapidly growing data. Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.

Abstract: It is increasingly important to evaluate how text generation systems based on large language models (LLMs) behave, such as their tendency to produce harmful output or their sensitivity to adversarial inputs. Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples. We demonstrate how the Bayesian approach can provide useful uncertainty quantification about the behavior of LLM-based systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in high-resource languages like English, yet their effectiveness in low-resource and morphologically rich languages remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of seven cutting-edge LLMs -- including GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5~Sonnet, LLaMA~3.1, Mistral~Large~2, LLaMA-2~Chat~13B, and Mistral~7B~Instruct -- on a new cross-lingual benchmark covering \textbf{Cantonese, Japanese, and Turkish}. Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.
  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity. We provide detailed quantitative results, qualitative error analysis, and discuss implications for developing more culturally aware and linguistically generalizable LLMs. Our benchmark and evaluation data are released to foster reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的自我监督框架，通过引入偏斜感知聚合策略，显著提高了监护模型的语义稳健性，同时改善了模型的校准度和准确性。

Abstract: Guard models are a critical component of LLM safety, but their sensitivity to superficial linguistic variations remains a key vulnerability. We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties. These results highlight the value of treating semantic consistency as a first-class training objective and provide a scalable recipe for building more reliable guard models.

Conclusion: 大多数语言模型在多样化决策环境中的一致性准确性表现不佳，且精度与真实理解之间存在脱节，强调了需要新的评估协议以提升模型理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often achieve impressive predictive accuracy, yet correctness alone does not imply genuine understanding. True LLM understanding, analogous to human expertise, requires making consistent, well-founded decisions across multiple instances and diverse domains, relying on relevant and domain-grounded decision factors. We introduce Structured Tabular Decision Simulations (STaDS), a suite of expert-like decision settings that evaluate LLMs as if they were professionals undertaking structured decision ``exams''. In this context, understanding is defined as the ability to identify and rely on the correct decision factors, features that determine outcomes within a domain. STaDS jointly assesses understanding through: (i) question and instruction comprehension, (ii) knowledge-based prediction, and (iii) reliance on relevant decision factors. By analyzing 9 frontier LLMs across 15 diverse decision settings, we find that (a) most models struggle to achieve consistently strong accuracy across diverse domains; (b) models can be accurate yet globally unfaithful, and there are frequent mismatches between stated rationales and factors driving predictions. Our findings highlight the need for global-level understanding evaluation protocols and advocate for novel frameworks that go beyond accuracy to enhance LLMs' understanding ability.

Abstract: Cochlear implants (CI) significantly improve spoken language in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), yet outcomes remain more variable than in children with normal hearing. This variability cannot be reliably predicted for individual children using age at implantation or residual hearing. This study aims to compare the accuracy of traditional machine learning (ML) to deep transfer learning (DTL) algorithms to predict post-CI spoken language development of children with bilateral SNHL using a binary classification model of high versus low language improvers. A total of 278 implanted children enrolled from three centers. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of prediction models based upon brain neuroanatomic features using traditional ML and DTL learning. DTL prediction models using bilinear attention-based fusion strategy achieved: accuracy of 92.39% (95% CI, 90.70%-94.07%), sensitivity of 91.22% (95% CI, 89.98%-92.47%), specificity of 93.56% (95% CI, 90.91%-96.21%), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.969-0.986). DTL outperformed traditional ML models in all outcome measures. DTL was significantly improved by direct capture of discriminative and task-specific information that are advantages of representation learning enabled by this approach over ML. The results support the feasibility of a single DTL prediction model for language prediction of children served by CI programs worldwide.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的增强大型语言模型与专家混合语音投影器的方法，显著改善了代码切换语音翻译中的语义建模与数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) speech translation (ST) refers to translating speech that alternates between two or more languages into a target language text, which poses significant challenges due to the complexity of semantic modeling and the scarcity of CS data. Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Conclusion: GVF Finetuning有效提高了多模态大语言模型的视觉事实一致性，同时保持了其在一般多模态基准上的表现。

Abstract: Visual hallucination, where Multimodal Large Language Models fabricate details inconsistent with image content, critically undermines their reliability. Existing fine-tuning methods offer limited improvement, failing to deeply intervene in factual reasoning. This paper introduces Grounded Visual Factualization (GVF) Finetuning, a novel approach to systematically enhance MLLM visual factual consistency. GVF integrates explicit factual signals via three core mechanisms: Factual Anchor Data Augmentation, enriching training data with structured factual anchors and counter-factual prompts; Fact-Aware Instruction Tuning, embedding these cues into explicit instructions; and a Factual Consistency Loss function, specifically penalizing factual inaccuracies. Evaluated on LLaVA-1.5-13B, GVF Finetuning significantly outperforms standard fine-tuning on the VHTest benchmark for both Open-Ended Question (OEQ) and Yes/No Question (YNQ) formats. Crucially, GVF maintains or even slightly improves performance on general multimodal benchmarks like MME and POPE, demonstrating effective mitigation of visual hallucinations without compromising general understanding and reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming materials science. This review examines recent LLM applications across the materials discovery pipeline, focusing on three key areas: mining scientific literature , predictive modelling, and multi-agent experimental systems. We highlight how LLMs extract valuable information such as synthesis conditions from text, learn structure-property relationships, and can coordinate agentic systems integrating computational tools and laboratory automation. While progress has been largely dependent on closed-source commercial models, our benchmark results demonstrate that open-source alternatives can match performance while offering greater transparency, reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. As open-source models continue to improve, we advocate their broader adoption to build accessible, flexible, and community-driven AI platforms for scientific discovery.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) for text classification, which uses a few input-label demonstrations to describe a task, has demonstrated impressive performance on large language models (LLMs). However, the selection of in-context demonstrations plays a crucial role and can significantly affect LLMs' performance. Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies. Further analysis reveals a positive correlation between the performance of LLMs and the accuracy of the underlying SLMs used for label distribution estimation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently scale-up the model while keeping relatively low inference cost. As MoE models only activate part of the experts, related work has proposed expert prediction and caching methods to prefetch the experts for faster inference. However, existing approaches utilize the activations from the previous layer for prediction, incurring low accuracy and leave the first layer unoptimized. Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer. Our lightweight, pre-attention expert routers achieve 93.03% accuracy on DeepSeek V2 Lite, 94.69% on Qwen3-30B, and 97.62% on Phi-mini-MoE, showing about 15% improvement on absolute accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 鉴于气候变化和全球变暖的问题日益严重，建立工具以估算消费品的环境影响显得尤为重要。

Method: 采用基于LLM的工作流，结合传统LCA的方法论与LLM的推理能力，生成LCA所需的过程信息。

Result: SpiderGen在真实LCA文档的评估中表现出62%的F1分数，且在生成LCA过程信息方面优于多个基线技术。

Conclusion: SpiderGen展示了其在生成生命周期评估（LCA）过程信息方面的潜力，不仅准确且高效，显著降低了成本和时间。

Abstract: Investigating the effects of climate change and global warming caused by GHG emissions have been a primary concern worldwide. These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the "scope" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.

Abstract: This work aims to investigate how different Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment methods affect the models' responses to prompt attacks. We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are adopted in an increasingly wide range of applications, user-model interactions have grown in both frequency and scale. Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple "Think again" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.

Abstract: Recursive prompting with large language models enables scalable synthetic dataset generation but introduces the risk of bias amplification. We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores. This paradox demonstrates that semantic similarity metrics may diverge from behavioral fairness outcomes, highlighting the need for multidimensional evaluation in responsible synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Recent closed-source multimodal systems have made great advances, but their hidden language for understanding the world remains opaque because of their black-box architectures. In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round "telephone game" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., "hidden language." We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world. This study offers a new perspective on the hidden language of multimodal systems and lays the foundation for future research on the interpretability and controllability of multimodal systems.

Method: 引入Squid Game作为一种动态和对抗的评估环境，通过与其他LLM对手的互动游戏来评估LLM。

Result: 对50个LLM进行了在Squid Game上的评估，发现相同模型系谱中的性能存在明显的世代相变，并且一些模型采用投机性捷径以获胜，可能导致静态基准下的评估污染。

Conclusion: 动态评估可以作为静态评估的补充，强调了模型在对抗性场景下的行为表现的重要性。

Abstract: Contemporary benchmarks are struggling to keep pace with the development of large language models (LLMs). Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations. The code and data will be released in the future.

Result: 在Llama系列模型中发现存在一个称为开始点的拐点，此点之前的干预对预测结果有显著影响，之后则影响减弱。

Conclusion: 指令执行的开始点可以通过对不同任务和模型规模进行比较而确定。

Abstract: Following an instruction involves distinct sub-processes, such as reading content, reading the instruction, executing it, and producing an answer. We ask where, along the layer stack, instruction following begins, the point where reading gives way to doing. We introduce three simple datasets (Key-Value, Quote Attribution, Letter Selection) and two hop compositions of these tasks. Using activation patching on minimal-contrast prompt pairs, we measure a layer-wise flip rate that indicates when substituting selected residual activations changes the predicted answer. Across models in the Llama family, we observe an inflection point, which we term onset, where interventions that change predictions before this point become largely ineffective afterward. Multi-hop compositions show a similar onset location. These results provide a simple, replicable way to locate where instruction following begins and to compare this location across tasks and model sizes.

Conclusion: 论文强调在国际关系领域应用大型语言模型时，需同时评估国家级偏见与模型性能。

Abstract: This paper systematically examines nation-level biases exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the domain of International Relations (IR). Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B. Our findings emphasize the need to assess nation-level bias alongside performance when applying LLMs in the IR domain.

Conclusion: 
PiAttention在长范围建模上超越了RingAttention，具备线性复杂度和更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length remains a fundamental bottleneck for long-range modeling. While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $π$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length. We prove that \PiAttention achieves $\mathcal{O}(kL + π\log L)$ receptive field growth compared to $\mathcal{O}(kL)$ for RingAttention, where $k$ is the local window size, $π$ is the skip period, and $L$ is the sequence length. Extensive experiments on language modeling, retrieval, and vision-language tasks demonstrate that \PiAttention matches or surpasses dense attention quality with 8.3\% lower perplexity than RingAttention while using 50\% fewer GPUs for the same context length. Our detailed ablations and visualizations reveal the importance of periodic skips, adaptive fusion, and head-level sparsity coordination for efficient long-context modeling.

Abstract: Summarizing consumer health questions (CHQs) can ease communication in healthcare, but unfaithful summaries that misrepresent medical details pose serious risks. We propose a framework that combines TextRank-based sentence extraction and medical named entity recognition with large language models (LLMs) to enhance faithfulness in medical text summarization. In our experiments, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-2-7B model on the MeQSum (English) and BanglaCHQ-Summ (Bangla) datasets, achieving consistent improvements across quality (ROUGE, BERTScore, readability) and faithfulness (SummaC, AlignScore) metrics, and outperforming zero-shot baselines and prior systems. Human evaluation further shows that over 80\% of generated summaries preserve critical medical information. These results highlight faithfulness as an essential dimension for reliable medical summarization and demonstrate the potential of our approach for safer deployment of LLMs in healthcare contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs, specifically GPT-4o, show strong correlation with human evaluations in grading educational assessments, though some variability exists in open-ended responses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for educational tasks such as grading, yet their alignment with human evaluation in real classrooms remains underexamined. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using an LLM (GPT-4o) to evaluate short-answer quizzes and project reports in an undergraduate Computational Linguistics course. We collect responses from approximately 50 students across five quizzes and receive project reports from 14 teams. LLM-generated scores are compared against human evaluations conducted independently by the course teaching assistants (TAs). Our results show that GPT-4o achieves strong correlation with human graders (up to 0.98) and exact score agreement in 55\% of quiz cases. For project reports, it also shows strong overall alignment with human grading, while exhibiting some variability in scoring technical, open-ended responses. We release all code and sample data to support further research on LLMs in educational assessment. This work highlights both the potential and limitations of LLM-based grading systems and contributes to advancing automated grading in real-world academic settings.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) can process many languages, yet how they internally represent this diversity remains unclear. Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways. We argue that understanding this pivot-language mechanism is crucial for improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Conclusion: 本研究表明情感人工智能在对非主流方言（如非裔美国人方言）进行情感识别时存在偏差，可能会加强种族刻板印象，因此需要构建更具文化和方言意识的情感计算系统。

Abstract: Automated emotion detection is widely used in applications ranging from well-being monitoring to high-stakes domains like mental health and hiring. However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed "silver" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.

Abstract: Task arithmetic is a powerful technique for transferring skills between Large Language Models (LLMs), but it often suffers from negative interference when models have diverged during training. We address this limitation by first aligning the models' parameter spaces, leveraging the inherent permutation, rotation, and scaling symmetries of Transformer architectures. We adapt parameter space alignment for modern Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) and SwiGLU layers, exploring both weight-based and activation-based approaches. Using this alignment-first strategy, we successfully transfer advanced reasoning skills to a non-reasoning model. Experiments on challenging reasoning benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms standard task arithmetic. This work provides an effective approach for merging and transferring specialized skills across evolving LLM families, reducing redundant fine-tuning and enhancing model adaptability.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）能否在社交或对话判断任务中可靠地进行评估，以及对话框架如何影响模型的判断。

Method: 通过对比直接事实查询与对话判断任务的模型表现，评估模型在不同情景下的判断能力，并测试其在简单反驳下的反应。

Result: 观察到模型表现平均变化9.24%，表明最小对话上下文能显著改变模型判断，一些模型在社交框架任务中表现出顺从倾向，而另一些则变得过于严苛。

Conclusion: 对话框架在LLM评估中的关键作用显著，提出的方法有助于提升对话系统的可信度。

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from "Is this statement correct?" to "Is this speaker correct?". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal ("The previous answer is incorrect.") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation. The proposed framework offers a reproducible methodology for diagnosing model conviction and contributes to the development of more trustworthy dialogue systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in everyday life and are entering higher-stakes applications ranging from summarizing meeting transcripts to answering doctors' questions. As was the case with earlier predictive models, it is crucial that we develop tools for explaining the output of LLMs, be it a summary, list, response to a question, etc. With these needs in mind, we introduce In-Context Explainability 360 (ICX360), an open-source Python toolkit for explaining LLMs with a focus on the user-provided context (or prompts in general) that are fed to the LLMs. ICX360 contains implementations for three recent tools that explain LLMs using both black-box and white-box methods (via perturbations and gradients respectively). The toolkit, available at https://github.com/IBM/ICX360, contains quick-start guidance materials as well as detailed tutorials covering use cases such as retrieval augmented generation, natural language generation, and jailbreaking.

Abstract: Negative bias refers to the tendency of large language models (LLMs) to excessively generate negative responses in binary decision tasks (e.g., yes-no question answering). Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an "I don't know" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response. Our work reveals the various factors that influence negative bias, providing critical insights for mitigating it in LLMs.

Abstract: Progress in biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL) is currently hindered by a fragmented data landscape, a lack of resources for building explainable models, and the limitations of semantically-blind evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we present MedPath, a large-scale and multi-domain biomedical EL dataset that builds upon nine existing expert-annotated EL datasets. In MedPath, all entities are 1) normalized using the latest version of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), 2) augmented with mappings to 62 other biomedical vocabularies and, crucially, 3) enriched with full ontological paths -- i.e., from general to specific -- in up to 11 biomedical vocabularies. MedPath directly enables new research frontiers in biomedical NLP, facilitating training and evaluation of semantic-rich and interpretable EL systems, and the development of the next generation of interoperable and explainable clinical NLP models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，工具增强的语言模型在推理上存在严重缺陷，尽管它们的最终答案准确性有所提高，但推理能力却明显下降，使用工具越多，推理连贯性越差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨工具增强语言模型在解决问题时的推理能力及其可靠性，尤其是在使用代码解释器工具时。

Method: 通过使用PYMATH基准，分析工具使用对推理过程的影响，并开发了多维评估套件来量化推理退化。

Result: 尽管TaLMs在最终答案准确性上取得高达19.3个百分点的提升，但其推理行为却持续恶化，并在高风险案例中出现约55%的工具诱导近视（TIM）现象。

Conclusion: 即使工具使用得当，工具增强的语言模型（TaLMs）在推理时也存在缺陷，导致结果看似正确但缺乏合理的解释。

Abstract: Tool-augmented Language Models (TaLMs) can invoke external tools to solve problems beyond their parametric capacity. However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

Method: 构建EMSQA数据集，并采用Expert-CoT提示策略和ExpertRAG检索增强生成管道。

Conclusion: 引入专业知识的增强型大语言模型在医学问答中表现出色，尤其是在适应特定临床领域和认证等级时，取得了显著的准确率提升。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering, yet they often overlook the domain-specific expertise that professionals depend on, such as the clinical subject areas (e.g., trauma, airway) and the certification level (e.g., EMT, Paramedic). Existing approaches typically apply general-purpose prompting or retrieval strategies without leveraging this structured context, limiting performance in high-stakes settings. We address this gap with EMSQA, an 24.3K-question multiple-choice dataset spanning 10 clinical subject areas and 4 certification levels, accompanied by curated, subject area-aligned knowledge bases (40K documents and 2M tokens). Building on EMSQA, we introduce (i) Expert-CoT, a prompting strategy that conditions chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning on specific clinical subject area and certification level, and (ii) ExpertRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that grounds responses in subject area-aligned documents and real-world patient data. Experiments on 4 LLMs show that Expert-CoT improves up to 2.05% over vanilla CoT prompting. Additionally, combining Expert-CoT with ExpertRAG yields up to a 4.59% accuracy gain over standard RAG baselines. Notably, the 32B expertise-augmented LLMs pass all the computer-adaptive EMS certification simulation exams.

Result: 增强的支持向量机在准确性、召回率和F1分数上达到94%的最佳表现，而复杂模型如RNN和BERT则面临严重的过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 传统机器学习模型（如增强的支持向量机）在有限数据集上表现出最佳性能，而复杂的深度学习模型在数据匮乏时面临过拟合挑战。

Abstract: This paper explores the automatic classification of exam questions and learning outcomes according to Bloom's Taxonomy. A small dataset of 600 sentences labeled with six cognitive categories - Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation - was processed using traditional machine learning (ML) models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines), recurrent neural network architectures (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, BiGRU), transformer-based models (BERT and RoBERTa), and large language models (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, Anthropic). Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores. These findings highlight the challenges of training complex deep models on limited data and underscore the value of careful data augmentation and simpler algorithms (such as augmented SVM) for Bloom's Taxonomy classification.

We introduce a novel dataset of 176 symptom-diagnosis pairs extracted from House M.D., a medical television series validated for teaching rare disease recognition in medical education. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT 4o mini, GPT 5 mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro on narrative-based diagnostic reasoning tasks. Results show significant variation in performance, ranging from 16.48% to 38.64% accuracy, with newer model generations demonstrating a 2.3 times improvement. While all models face substantial challenges with rare disease diagnosis, the observed improvement across architectures suggests promising directions for future development. Our educationally validated benchmark establishes baseline performance metrics for narrative medical reasoning and provides a publicly accessible evaluation framework for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis research.

Abstract: Biomedical text embeddings have primarily been developed using research literature from PubMed, yet clinical cardiology practice relies heavily on procedural knowledge and specialized terminology found in comprehensive textbooks rather than research abstracts. This research practice gap limits the effectiveness of existing embedding models for clinical applications incardiology. This study trained CardioEmbed, a domain-specialized embedding model based on Qwen3-Embedding-8B, using contrastive learning on a curated corpus of seven comprehensive cardiology textbooks totaling approximately 150,000 sentences after deduplication. The model employs InfoNCE loss with in-batch negatives and achieves 99.60% retrieval accuracy on cardiac-specific semantic retrieval tasks, a +15.94 percentage point improvement over MedTE, the current state-of-the-art medical embedding model. On MTEB medical benchmarks, the model obtained BIOSSES 0.77 Spearman and SciFact 0.61 NDCG@10, indicating competitive performance on related biomedical domains. Domain-specialized training on comprehensive clinical textbooks yields near-perfect cardiology retrieval (99.60% Acc@1), improving over MedTE by +15.94 percentage points.

Conclusion: 提出的基准和评估系统为更严格的评估提供了坚实框架，促进了基于LLM的翻译的未来进展。

Abstract: The evaluation of discourse-level translation in expert domains remains inadequate, despite its centrality to knowledge dissemination and cross-lingual scholarly communication. While these translations demand discourse-level coherence and strict terminological precision, current evaluation methods predominantly focus on segment-level accuracy and fluency. To address this limitation, we introduce DiscoX, a new benchmark for discourse-level and expert-level Chinese-English translation. It comprises 200 professionally-curated texts from 7 domains, with an average length exceeding 1700 tokens. To evaluate performance on DiscoX, we also develop Metric-S, a reference-free system that provides fine-grained automatic assessments across accuracy, fluency, and appropriateness. Metric-S demonstrates strong consistency with human judgments, significantly outperforming existing metrics. Our experiments reveal a remarkable performance gap: even the most advanced LLMs still trail human experts on these tasks. This finding validates the difficulty of DiscoX and underscores the challenges that remain in achieving professional-grade machine translation. The proposed benchmark and evaluation system provide a robust framework for more rigorous evaluation, facilitating future advancements in LLM-based translation.

Result: 我们系统性分析了多个开源DPO数据集，并制作了新的DPO组合UltraMix。

Conclusion: 我们提出的UltraMix在性能上超越了最好的单一数据集，同时体积减少了30%。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) is a central objective of post-training, often achieved through reward modeling and reinforcement learning methods. Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了Renormalization方法，显著改善了多语言文本嵌入模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前文本嵌入模型的输出存在一致性偏差，因此需要一种方法来改善模型的输出质量。

Method: 提出了一种无训练、轻量级的解决方案，称为Renormalization，包含两种变体：直接从嵌入向量中减去常量μ，或减去嵌入向量在μ上的投影。

Result: Renormalization能显著提高现有模型的表现，在检索任务上提高了9.7σ，在分类任务上提高了3.1σ。

Conclusion: Renormalization显著提高了现有文本嵌入模型在多语言文本嵌入基准上的表现，特别是在检索和分类任务中。

Abstract: We find that current text embedding models produce outputs with a consistent bias, i.e., each embedding vector $e$ can be decomposed as $\tilde{e} + μ$, where $μ$ is almost identical across all sentences. We propose a plug-and-play, training-free and lightweight solution called Renormalization. Through extensive experiments, we show that renormalization consistently and statistically significantly improves the performance of existing models on the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB). In particular, across 38 models, renormalization improves performance by 9.7 $σ$ on retrieval tasks, 3.1 $σ$ on classification tasks, and 0.8 $σ$ on other types of tasks. Renormalization has two variants: directly subtracting $μ$ from $e$, or subtracting the projection of $e$ onto $μ$. We theoretically predict that the latter performs better, and our experiments confirm this prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs with链式思维（CoT）能够检测幻觉，只要其参数中包含足够的知识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent responses, but sometimes hallucinate facts. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs can detect their own hallucinations. We formulate hallucination detection as a classification task of a sentence. We propose a framework for estimating LLMs' capability of hallucination detection and a classification method using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to extract knowledge from their parameters. The experimental results indicated that GPT-$3.5$ Turbo with CoT detected $58.2\%$ of its own hallucinations. We concluded that LLMs with CoT can detect hallucinations if sufficient knowledge is contained in their parameters.

Method: 通过对2016、2020和2024年选举周期的辩论记录进行人工标注，随后进行统计和基于语言模型的分析。

Result: 研究探讨了一般用途的LLM与微调的变换器模型在检测正式政治演讲中的个人攻击的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了现代语言模型的任务特定适应如何有助于深入理解政治传播。

Abstract: Personal attacks have become a notable feature of U.S. presidential debates and play an important role in shaping public perception during elections. Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech. This study demonstrates how task-specific adaptation of modern language models can contribute to a deeper understanding of political communication.

Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在日常条件下表现优异，但在需要领域特定知识的上下文丰富场景中表现不佳，尤其是在处理长上下文信息时。

Method: SAP^2方法通过两阶段动态修剪和整合相关上下文关键词，结合语音驱动的注意力池化机制，进行高效的上下文嵌入压缩。

Result: 在SlideSpeech和LibriSpeech数据集上，SAP^2方法分别实现了7.71%和1.12%的字错误率，同时在SlideSpeech数据集中，减少了41.1%的偏见关键词错误率。SAP^2展现了在广泛上下文输入条件下的强大可扩展性。

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance in common conditions but often struggle to leverage long-context information in contextualized scenarios that require domain-specific knowledge, such as conference presentations. This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of SAP$^{2}$ on the SlideSpeech and LibriSpeech datasets, achieving word error rates (WER) of 7.71% and 1.12%, respectively. On SlideSpeech, our method notably reduces biased keyword error rates (B-WER) by 41.1% compared to non-contextual baselines. SAP$^{2}$ also exhibits robust scalability, consistently maintaining performance under extensive contextual input conditions on both datasets.

### [148] [Adverbs Revisited: Enhancing WordNet Coverage of Adverbs with a Supersense Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11214)
*Jooyoung Lee,Jader Martins Camboim de Sá*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文建立了一种系统的副词超义类别，以扩展WordNet，并支持多个自然语言处理应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于WordNet在名词和动词方面的丰富性，副词的语义分类仍然不完善，因此迫切需要为副词建立一个系统的分类体系。

Method: 通过注释验证一种基于语言学的副词超义类别的分类法，并进行初步的标注研究。

Result: 初步标注研究的结果表明，这些类别能够广泛涵盖自然文本中的副词，并且可以可靠地由人类标注者分配。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种为副词建立系统化的语义分类方法，以扩展WordNet的覆盖范围，并与语言理论更加一致。

Abstract: WordNet offers rich supersense hierarchies for nouns and verbs, yet adverbs remain underdeveloped, lacking a systematic semantic classification. We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling. We present the proposed supersense categories, annotation outcomes, and directions for future work.

*Jader Martins Camboim de Sá,Jooyoung Lee,Cédric Pruski,Marcos Da Silveira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LANE是一种新的对抗训练方法，通过生成挑战性负样本，提高了神经语言模型的词汇表示能力，改善了语义识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对神经语言模型常常过拟合全局句子表示，不够关注局部语义细节的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的对抗训练策略，称为LANE，通过故意将模型的学习重点转移到目标词上，并生成具有挑战性的负训练示例。

Result: 在词汇语义变化检测和词义消歧基准上，采用LANE方法的实验结果显示，该方法产生了更具区分性的单词表示，性能优于标准对比学习基线。同时，定性分析表明，所提出的负示例能更好地捕捉细微的意义差异，甚至在困难环境中也能如此。

Conclusion: LANE方法通过选择性标记替代词生成具有挑战性的负训练样本，提高了单词表示的可分离性，进而改善了模型在词义消歧和词汇语义变化检测任务上的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained word meaning resolution remains a critical challenge for neural language models (NLMs) as they often overfit to global sentence representations, failing to capture local semantic details. We propose a novel adversarial training strategy, called LANE, to address this limitation by deliberately shifting the model's learning focus to the target word. This method generates challenging negative training examples through the selective marking of alternate words in the training set. The goal is to force the model to create a greater separability between same sentences with different marked words. Experimental results on lexical semantic change detection and word sense disambiguation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields more discriminative word representations, improving performance over standard contrastive learning baselines. We further provide qualitative analyses showing that the proposed negatives lead to representations that better capture subtle meaning differences even in challenging environments. Our method is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing representation learning frameworks.

Abstract: The generation of questions and answers (QA) from knowledge graphs (KG) plays a crucial role in the development and testing of educational platforms, dissemination tools, and large language models (LLM). However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability, linguistic quality, and factual consistency. This paper presents a scalable and deterministic pipeline for generating natural language QA from KGs, with an additional refinement step using LLMs to further enhance linguistic quality. The approach first clusters KG triplets based on their relations, creating reusable templates through natural language rules derived from the entity types of objects and relations. A module then leverages LLMs to refine these templates, improving clarity and coherence while preserving factual accuracy. Finally, the instantiation of answer options is achieved through a selection strategy that introduces distractors from the KG. Our experiments demonstrate that this hybrid approach efficiently generates high-quality QA pairs, combining scalability with fluency and linguistic precision.

Abstract: Advancements in Machine Learning & Neural Networks in recent years have led to widespread implementations of Natural Language Processing across a variety of fields with remarkable success, solving a wide range of complicated problems. However, recent research has shown that machine learning models may be vulnerable in a number of ways, putting both the models and the systems theyre used in at risk. In this paper, we intend to analyze and experiment with the best of existing adversarial attack recipes and create new ones. We concentrated on developing a novel adversarial attack strategy on current state-of-the-art machine learning models by producing ambiguous inputs for the models to confound them and then constructing the path to the future development of the robustness of the models. We will develop adversarial instances with maximum perplexity, utilizing machine learning and deep learning approaches in order to trick the models. In our attack recipe, we will analyze several datasets and focus on creating obfuscous adversary examples to put the models in a state of perplexity, and by including the Bangla Language in the field of adversarial attacks. We strictly uphold utility usage reduction and efficiency throughout our work.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在金融领域的应用日益广泛，计算需求的高昂限制了许多组织的可及性，因此需要开发出一种高效、可扩展的模型调整策略。

Method: 提出了一种新的策略，称为分层自适应集成调整（LAET），通过分析隐藏状态表示，选择性地微调预训练大语言模型中最有效的层，同时冻结不太关键的层。

Result: LAET在金融NLP任务中显著降低了计算开销，同时超越了现有的基准和如GPT-4等最先进的大语言模型，即使使用较小的模型（约30亿参数）。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的分层自适应集成调整策略显著提高了金融NLP任务的表现，同时降低了计算资源的需求，使得更多组织能够利用这些先进的技术。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed the financial industry, enabling advancements in areas such as textual analysis, risk management, and forecasting. Large language models (LLMs) like BloombergGPT and FinMA have set new benchmarks across various financial NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, stock movement prediction, and credit risk assessment. Furthermore, FinMA-ES, a bilingual financial LLM, has also demonstrated strong performance using the FLARE and FLARE-ES benchmarks. However, the high computational demands of these models limit the accessibility of many organizations. To address this, we propose Layer-wise Adaptive Ensemble Tuning (LAET), a novel strategy that selectively fine-tunes the most effective layers of pre-trained LLMs by analyzing hidden state representations while freezing less critical layers. LAET significantly reduces computational overhead while enhancing task-specific performance. Our approach shows strong results in financial NLP tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks and state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4, even with smaller LLMs ($\sim$3B parameters). This work bridges cutting-edge financial NLP research and real-world deployment with efficient and scalable models for financial applications.

Abstract: The generation of highly fluent text by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge to information integrity and academic research. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Domain Detection of AI-Generated Text (M-DAIGT) shared task, which focuses on detecting AI-generated text across multiple domains, particularly in news articles and academic writing. M-DAIGT comprises two binary classification subtasks: News Article Detection (NAD) (Subtask 1) and Academic Writing Detection (AWD) (Subtask 2). To support this task, we developed and released a new large-scale benchmark dataset of 30,000 samples, balanced between human-written and AI-generated texts. The AI-generated content was produced using a variety of modern LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) and diverse prompting strategies. A total of 46 unique teams registered for the shared task, of which four teams submitted final results. All four teams participated in both Subtask 1 and Subtask 2. We describe the methods employed by these participating teams and briefly discuss future directions for M-DAIGT.

Motivation: 研究语言模型的学习能力，以了解其与人类语言习得的差异。

Method: 文献回顾，分析语言学习的证据和比较不同语言的学习难度。

Result: 大多数语言模型在学习已证实语言和一些不可能语言时表现相当，但缺乏人类特有的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 语言模型在学习已证实语言和许多不可能语言方面表现相似，难以学习的不可能语言通常更复杂或随机。

Abstract: According to Futrell and Mahowald [arXiv:2501.17047], both infants and language models (LMs) find attested languages easier to learn than impossible languages that have unnatural structures. We review the literature and show that LMs often learn attested and many impossible languages equally well. Difficult to learn impossible languages are simply more complex (or random). LMs are missing human inductive biases that support language acquisition.

Conclusion: 我们的研究为主动适应对话动态和参与度的听力助理迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出与人类偏好不一致，急需可扩展的对齐机制。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和弱到强泛化范式，提出了一种新的推理时间对齐框架。

Result: W2S-AlignTree在情感生成、摘要和指令跟随任务上显著超过强基线，在摘要任务上将Llama3-8B的性能从1.89提升至2.19，提升幅度为15.9%。

Conclusion: W2S-AlignTree能够在推理过程中动态平衡探索与利用，提升大型语言模型的生成质量，超越传统基线模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, yet their outputs often suffer from misalignment with human preferences due to the inadequacy of weak supervision and a lack of fine-grained control. Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, W2S-AlignTree raises the performance of Llama3-8B from 1.89 to 2.19, a relative improvement of 15.9 on the summarization task.

Abstract: Frontier model progress is often measured by academic benchmarks, which offer a limited view of performance in real-world professional contexts. Existing evaluations often fail to assess open-ended, economically consequential tasks in high-stakes domains like Legal and Finance, where practical returns are paramount. To address this, we introduce Professional Reasoning Bench (PRBench), a realistic, open-ended, and difficult benchmark of real-world problems in Finance and Law. We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories. Our analysis shows that models with similar overall scores can diverge significantly on specific capabilities. Common failure modes include inaccurate judgments, a lack of process transparency and incomplete reasoning, highlighting critical gaps in their reliability for professional adoption.

Abstract: Model checking of strategic abilities is a notoriously hard problem, even more so in the realistic case of agents with imperfect information, acting in a stochastic environment. Assume-guarantee reasoning can be of great help here, providing a way to decompose the complex problem into a small set of easier subproblems.
  In this paper, we propose several schemes for assume-guarantee verification of probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information. We prove the soundness of the schemes, and discuss their completeness. On the way, we also propose a new variant of (non-probabilistic) alternating-time logic, where the strategic modalities capture "achieving at most $\varphi$," analogous to Levesque's logic of "only knowing."

Conclusion: 在多智能体系统中，设计模式的安全性亟需关注，现有设计模式存在显著的脆弱性，需要在设计中增强安全意识。

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems (MAS). As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Motivation: 探讨在线监考系统对残疾学生的影响，了解他们在隐私和考试便利之间的权衡。

Method: 通过对经历过在线监考考试的学生进行访谈，使用反思性主题分析方法。

Result: 访谈显示，学生对监控与其残疾之间的互动感到焦虑，面临误解和认知负担的风险。

Conclusion: 在线监考系统在监控学生考试的同时，侵犯了学生隐私，尤其是对残疾学生造成了更大的负担。

Abstract: Online proctoring systems (OPS) are technologies and services that are used to monitor students during an online exam to deter cheating. However, OPS often violates student privacy by implementing overly intrusive surveillance to which students cannot consent meaningfully. The technologies used in OPS have been shown to unfairly flag students with disabilities. Our reflexive thematic analysis of interviews with students who have first-hand experience with online invigilated exams and who have disability accommodations points to their anxiety about the interaction between surveillance and their disabilities, leading to fears about misrepresentation and increased cognitive load on the exam. Students describe the compromises they need to make with their privacy and accommodations to take remote tests and share their privacy values. We present the implications for the design of OPS to mitigate the issues faced by disabled students.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to Large Reasoning Models, which produce step-by-step reasoning traces. These traces offer insight into how models think and their goals, improving explainability and helping users follow the logic, learn the process, and even debug errors. These traces, however, are often verbose and complex, making them cognitively demanding to comprehend. We address this challenge with ReTrace, an interactive system that structures and visualizes textual reasoning traces to support understanding. We use a validated reasoning taxonomy to produce structured reasoning data and investigate two types of interactive visualizations thereof. In a controlled user study, both visualizations enabled users to comprehend the model's reasoning more accurately and with less perceived effort than a raw text baseline. The results of this study could have design implications for making long and complex machine-generated reasoning processes more usable and transparent, an important step in AI explainability.

Abstract: IoT Trigger-Action Platforms (TAPs) typically offer coarse-grained permission controls. Even when fine-grained controls are available, users are likely overwhelmed by the complexity of setting privacy preferences. This paper contributes to usable privacy management for TAPs by deriving privacy clusters and profiles for different types of users that can be semi-automatically assigned or suggested to them. We developed and validated a questionnaire, based on users' privacy concerns regarding confidentiality and control and their requirements towards transparency in TAPs. In an online study (N=301), where participants were informed about potential privacy risks, we clustered users by their privacy concerns and requirements into Basic, Medium and High Privacy clusters. These clusters were then characterized by the users' data sharing preferences, based on a factorial vignette approach, considering the data categories, the data recipient types, and the purpose of data sharing. Our findings show three distinct privacy profiles, providing a foundation for more usable privacy controls in TAPs.

Abstract: This paper reports a practice-based investigation into authoring responsive light and sound in immersive performance without writing code. A modular system couples live gesture, position, and speech inputs to scenographic outputs through a visual logic layer that performers can operate in rehearsal. Across six workshops with eight professional performance-makers, we staged a progression from parallel ensemble and technical training to integrated dramaturgy, culminating in a single-spectator scratch immersive performance with interactive elements. This paper details the system's building blocks and the workshop arc. A reflexive reading of workshop video logs, post-workshop focus groups, and facilitator notes surfaced three ensemble-level strategies that made the technology workable in a hybrid devising/design practice: rotating roles between operator, performer, and mediator; embracing controlled imperfection as a creative resource; and using technology-describing metaphors to support creative practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着音视频大型语言模型的进步，相关任务的计算需求增加，而现有的KV缓存优化策略未能有效处理音视频的时效性和复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种名为AccKV的自适应聚焦和交叉校准KV缓存优化框架，采用层自适应聚焦技术和交叉校准技术。

Result: 实验结果表明，AccKV在提高AV-LLMs的计算效率的同时，能够有效保持模型的准确性。

Conclusion: AccKV显著提高了AV-LLMs的计算效率，同时保持了模型的准确性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) have enhanced their capabilities in tasks like audio-visual question answering and multimodal dialog systems. Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities. The experimental results show that AccKV can significantly improve the computational efficiency of AV-LLMs while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: 本研究提出LT-Soups框架，改善长尾分布下的模型性能，特别解决了头类和尾类准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨真实数据集中长尾分布对模型表现的影响，尤其是在头类和尾类之间的准确性权衡，并且识别头尾比作为影响这一权衡的重要因素。

Method: 提出了LT-Soups，一个两阶段的模型汤框架，第一阶段通过对平衡子集的微调平均模型以减少头类偏差，第二阶段仅对全数据集的分类器进行微调以恢复头类准确性。

Result: 通过CIFAR100和其他六个基准数据集的受控实验，展示了PEFT在尾部密集场景下表现卓越，而在更平衡和头重的分布中则性能下降。

Conclusion: LT-Soups在各种不平衡的情况下相比PEFT和传统模型汤提供了更优的权衡效果。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT在数学推理任务上的表现不佳，主要由于其早期推理阶段生成有效推理前缀的困难以及对数字编码的干扰。

Method: 通过优化初始推理前缀的生成、干预早期推理阶段防止误差积累，并控制干预向量的大小以维护数字编码，提出了BREP ReFT方法。

Result: 通过大量实验，证明了BREP ReFT在多个模型架构上具有更强的效果、效率和稳健的泛化能力。

Conclusion: BREP ReFT在数学推理任务中表现优于标准ReFT和基于权重的PEFT方法，展现了卓越的效能和高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

Result: 提出了可以仅使用前自动微分或反向自动微分计算跟踪的技术，证明了在样本较少且模型状态与参数计数差距较大时，单侧估算器明显优于Hutch++。

Conclusion: 引入了无矩阵计算的随机化方法，可以显著加快NTK的分析速度，提高实际应用的效率。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

Conclusion: 本文提出的两种新方法在确保全局最优性的同时，显著提高了线性预测聚类的效率，尤其在重叠集群的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Motivation: 为了理解模型在处理复杂算术函数时的学习机制，特别是如何根据输入的二进制表示推断出循环长度。

Method: 通过研究不同进制下Transformer模型对长Collatz步骤的预测准确性，以及分析模型的学习模式和错误案例，进行系统性探索。

Result: 模型在进制为24和32时达到近99.7%的准确率，在其他低进制时准确率显著下降；所有模型均显现出对相同模糊关系类输入的共同学习模式，且错误案例表现出可预测的特征。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，Transformer模型在预测Collatz步骤时的学习模式揭示了计算循环长度的控制结构的重要性，同时指出了模型错误的可预测性，暗示此方法对语言模型的理解和改进具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

TL;DR: SurfaceBench is a new benchmark for symbolic surface discovery, focusing on diverse tasks and improving evaluation metrics for scientific equation discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for improved symbolic regression techniques, particularly those that avoid reliance on memorized formulas and focus on scientific equivalence.

Method: Introducing SurfaceBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 183 tasks across various categories, including ground-truth equations and three-dimensional data.

Result: Experiments demonstrate limitations of current state-of-the-art frameworks in generalizing across different equation representation types and complexities.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench establishes a novel benchmark for symbolic surface discovery, enabling thorough evaluation of equation discovery methods, particularly in complex domains.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EarthSight is a distributed framework for satellite image analysis that improves processing time and reduces latency by optimizing computation and prioritizing images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to address the delays caused by traditional satellite image processing methods, which are hampered by limited bandwidth and isolated compute nodes.

Method: EarthSight uses multi-task inference on satellites, a ground-station query scheduler, and dynamic filter ordering to enhance the image analysis process.

Result: Evaluations showed that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and decreases the 90th percentile end-to-end latency from 51 minutes to 21 minutes compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: EarthSight significantly improves the efficiency and speed of satellite image processing by employing a distributed decision-making framework that optimizes computation and prioritizes image transmission.

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Conclusion: 通过在在线强化学习环境中应用低方差回报估计，我们的方法在样本效率和性能上优于传统的策略梯度方法。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Conclusion: 提出的STAMP适配器在轻量级参数的同时，能够有效地利用通用TSFM进行EEG数据建模，并在临床任务分类中表现出与现有EEGFMs相媲美的性能。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Motivation: 现有的代码选择算法在识别正确程序方面存在不足，尤其是在处理等效性和LLM错误时。

Method: ExPairT-LLM算法通过向LLM提出成对成员资格和成对等价性的新查询类型进行代码选择。

Result: ExPairT-LLM在四个流行的代码数据集上进行评估，平均成功率比现有最佳代码选择算法提高了13.0%，最高可达27.1%。

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM通过提出新的查询类型成功提高了代码选择的准确性，超越了现有的最佳算法。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Conclusion: PAZO方法在高度私密环境下展现出优越的隐私和效用平衡，相比最佳的一阶基线有显著优势，并实现最高16倍的运行速度提升。

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Conclusion: SKF有效实现了实时稀疏非线性系统的识别，特别是在应对具有漂移或切换参数的复杂系统方面。

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM展现出在多个数据集上的有效性和优越性，解决了现有方法面临的图重建损失和图拓扑噪声的问题。

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于现有方法在信号波动和领域转移下的不足，本研究旨在提出一种更稳健的方法来定位LoRa标签。

Method: 采用强化学习模型，通过RSSI优化空间表示及探索策略，指导传感器最小化移动次数，以寻找LoRa标签。

Result: LoRaCompass在超过80km^2的测试环境中，将定位成功率提高到90%以上，并且搜索路径长度与初始距离线性相关，较现有方法提升40%。

Conclusion: LoRaCompass在多种未知环境中成功定位LoRa标签，显示出高成功率和高效率，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Conclusion: 提出的零-shot合成验证框架能够有效地监测模型性能，并确定提前停止的时机，从而提高计算效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，HealSplit 在各类攻击场景中表现出色，展现了出色的鲁棒性和防御效果。

Conclusion: HealSplit 是首个专为分裂联邦学习（SFL）量身定制的统一防御框架，能有效检测和恢复五种复杂的毒害攻击，表现优于现有的十种尖端防御方法。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Conclusion: NASK在多个图基准测试中表现优越，证明了其有效性和相对其他方法的优势。

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: EHR基础的癌症预测模型在识别高风险个体方面优于传统方法，显示了其在早期检测策略中的临床潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的癌症筛查指南仅覆盖少数癌症类型，并依赖于狭义的标准，需探讨更有效的识别高风险个体的方法。

Method: 通过系统评估EHR基础的预测模型与传统风险因素（例如基因突变和家族癌症史），在八种主要癌症类型中识别高风险个体，使用来自All of Us研究项目的数据。

Result: EHR基础模型比传统风险因素在鉴别高风险癌症个体方面，能实现3到6倍的真实癌症案例富集，且EHR基础模型的预测性能在26种癌症类型中进一步提升。

Conclusion: 基于电子健康记录（EHR）的预测模型在识别高风险癌症个体方面表现优于传统风险因素，具有更高的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Conclusion: MeZO在设备内存约束下显示出在准确性方面的优越性，尽管可能需要更长的微调时间。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的多元校准方法能够有效应对在不完美预测情况下的最佳匹配问题，确保算法的竞争性表现，并给出了样本复杂度界限。

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Result: 理论分析为量化下的生成劣化提供了上界，实证结果显示在2-3比特每参数的情况下，OT量化方法能够保持生成质量和潜在空间稳定性，而其他方法则未能做到。

Conclusion: OT-based量化方法能够有效压缩Flow Matching生成模型，保留生成质量与潜在空间稳定性，适用于边缘与嵌入式AI应用。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据敏感环境中，传统的完全重训练或数据重播方法不切实际，因此需要一种能在不依赖历史数据的情况下保持模型性能的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: RETROFIT方法在持续学习中有效减轻遗忘，同时保持模型的适应性，在恶意软件检测和二进制文摘任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Conclusion: FairReweighing算法在提高回归模型的分离性方面优于现有的回归公平性解决方案，同时保持高精度。

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文探讨多步预测中的递归和直接策略，发现递归策略在某些条件下可以同时具有较低的偏倚和较高的方差，提供了选择策略的新视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视传统观点，即递归策略偏倚高而方差低，直接策略偏倚低而方差高，探讨这两者的实际应用与适用场景。

Method: 通过分解预期的多步预测误差为三部分：不可减少噪声、结构逼近间隙和估计方差项，重新审视了递归与直接策略的比较。

Result: 对于线性预测器，结构间隙在任何数据集上均为零；对于非线性预测器，递归的组合使用可能增加模型抑或的可表达性，其结构间隙则依赖于模型和数据。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，递归策略在某些情况下可能具有较低的偏倚以及较高的方差，具体取决于模型的非线性程度和噪声特征。

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Conclusion: 提出的新自适应预测集算法相比现有方法在准确性和适应性评估上更具优势。

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了自注意动力学与Oja流的多智能体版本之间的关系，并对自注意力系统的平衡态进行了分类，指出其与值矩阵的特征向量的关系。

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: 引入的FlashMoBA实现了高效的MoBA执行，使得理论上的改进变得实际可行，同时在小块大小下实现了显著的速度提升。

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Motivation: 提出无约束人工智能遵循类似热力学第二定律的原则，探讨伦理熵自发增加的现象，以强调持续对齐工作的重要性。

Method: 通过定义伦理熵并证明其随时间的导数始终非负，推导出对齐工作的重要稳定性边界，并使用模拟验证该理论。

Conclusion: 该框架将人工智能对齐问题重新定义为连续热力学控制问题，为维护高级自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供量化基础。

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 提出的新测量方法在多个设置中表现出竞争力或更优，显著影响所选解决方案的特征。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Conclusion: HyperComplEx在知识图嵌入方面表现优异，尤其是在处理大型数据集时，提高了预测准确性并保持了高效训练。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

Conclusion: 该框架在阿尔茨海默病研究中展现出优越的预测准确性和可解释性，并揭示了超出常规连接度量的额外疾病驱动因素。

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Result: 实验结果表明，DSS在跟踪和路径规划精度上优于序列预测、模仿学习、无模型强化学习和其他规划方法。

Conclusion: DSS框架显著提高了自主驾驶中的跟踪与路径规划精度。

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Conclusion: RLSLM是一种高效、可解释的混合强化学习框架，能够在人类社交环境中实现舒适的导航，并优于传统的基于规则的方法。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.
