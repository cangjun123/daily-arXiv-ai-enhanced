Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种降噪方法，改善Kaguya TC影像生成的3D月球地图质量，以适应未来月球任务的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球探索月球的努力加剧，对高质量3D月球地图的需求变得愈加重要，尤其是针对如NASA的Endurance任务概念中，计划的探测器将横跨2000公里穿越南极-艾特肯盆地的长距离任务。由于Kaguya TC影像虽然可以提供全球10米/像素的图像，但由于立体匹配错误和JPEG压缩伪影导致高度不准确，因此需要改善其生成的3D地图的质量。

Method: 本论文提出了一种改善由Kaguya TC影像生成的3D地图质量的方法，重点在于缓解压缩导致的视差图噪声影响。具体方法包括分析Kaguya TC影像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式，特别是在较暗区域，并通过降噪技术提升视差图像质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效降低了高程噪声，提高了用于未来月球任务中地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 本研究中提出的方法可以有效降低压缩图像中视差图的残留噪声，从而提高3D月球地图的质量，提高未来月球任务中地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了CLIP和DINO在视觉语言模型中的表现，发现CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现较好，而DINO在视觉集中型任务中略占优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于DINO的原因，是语言监督还是更大的训练数据导致。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下，预训练CLIP和DINO，并通过嵌入分析及在20个VQA基准上的评估进行比较。

Result: CLIP在处理高层次语义（如对象类别和文本）方面表现较好，而DINO对低层次特征（如颜色和风格）更敏感。CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现出色，而DINO在视觉集中型任务中稍胜一筹。

Conclusion: 通过对比CLIP和DINO的表现，研究揭示了视觉编码器设计在VLM表现中的重要性，并指出语言监督的不同变体带来的增益有限。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

TL;DR: 研究提出双模型框架，通过分开训练VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL提高任务表现，在AI City Challenge中表现良好，总体排名第十。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在交通安全分析中捕捉细致的行为模式并生成全面的描述，从而预防事故的发生。

Method: 研究采用了一个双模型框架，分别对VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL进行任务特定优化，以减少任务干扰，并通过分开训练的方法来提高不同任务的有效性。

Result: 在WTS数据集上的实验中，VideoLLaMA在时间推理方面表现出色，CIDEr分数为1.1001；而Qwen2.5-VL在视觉理解方面表现出色，VQA准确率达60.80%。整体方法在AI City Challenge中获得第10名，且与联合训练相比，VQA准确率提高了8.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究通过双模型框架的策略性优化，有效降低了任务干扰，使模型在特定任务上更为专精。实验结果表明，该方法在2025 AI City Challenge Track 2上取得了良好的表现。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入空间推理框架，提升3D环境中的空间理解能力，尤其针对仓库中的场景杂乱和遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言系统在仓库等大型3D环境中面对场景杂乱和遮挡时表现不佳，需要提高空间理解能力。

Method: 通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示，增强模型对物体几何和布局的推理能力，并针对不同问题类别进行监督微调，以提高空间理解能力。

Result: 综合管道实现了最终得分73.0606，在公共排行榜上排名第4，展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过结构化提示增强和针对性优化，可以有效提升实际工业环境中的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [5] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates the explainability of Vision Transformer architectures, finding that DINO with Grad-CAM offers the best interpretability for medical imaging, enhancing clinical trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is the need for interpretability in medical imaging models, as it directly affects clinical trust and adoption. Understanding model decisions, especially in complex systems like Vision Transformers, is crucial for their integration into medical diagnostics.

Method: The study evaluates various Vision Transformer architectures (ViT, DeiT, DINO, Swin Transformer) using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. It involves both quantitative and qualitative analyses on peripheral blood cell and breast ultrasound image classification tasks.

Result: The study finds that DINO combined with Grad-CAM provides the most accurate and localized explanations. Grad-CAM consistently generates class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout results in scattered activations. DINO with Grad-CAM effectively highlights clinically relevant features even in misclassified instances, improving model transparency.

Conclusion: This research supports the integration of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows by enhancing model transparency through explainability techniques like Grad-CAM and DINO. This ensures more trust and reliability in clinical settings.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

TL;DR: VidMP3通过学习运动表示，实现灵活的结构和语义调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结构可变编辑中存在一致性和身份漂移问题，需要人类干预。

Method: 利用姿势和位置先验学习视频的广义运动表示，生成新视频。

Result: 该论文提出了一种名为VidMP3的新方法，通过利用姿势和位置先验从源视频中学习广义运动表示，以解决现有运动保留视频编辑方法中的结构可变问题。

Conclusion: VidMP3优于现有方法，可在保持原运动的同时实现结构和语义上的灵活性。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Conclusion: 本文讨论了域自适应及其各种实现方法，旨在解决图像分类中数据稀缺的问题，通过在一个数据集上训练的模型预测不同领域的相同类型数据，克服人工标记数据困难的问题。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Conclusion: 本文所提出的方法优于现有最先进的方法，在生成高质量、时间一致和多角色音频驱动视频方面表现出色，且操作简便高效、成本低。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种改进的3D场景重建方法，通过利用几何信息指导生成管道，解决了当前方法在重建质量和多视图一致性方面的不足。实验结果显示，该方法优于现有基线，特别是在未观察区域的重建上。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

*Wenjie Li,Xiangyi Wang,Heng Guo,Guangwei Gao,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSDiff方法，通过伪参考脸实现区域特定修复，显著提升旧照片人脸恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法难以处理局部伪影或面部颜色问题，需一种新方法增强面部恢复效果。

Method: 自监督选择性引导扩散（SSDiff）方法，结合预训练扩散模型生成的伪参考脸，在去噪过程施加结构性指导并在后续阶段进行颜色精炼。利用面部解析图和划痕掩码，选择性恢复破损区域并避免身份不匹配。

Result: SSDiff在感知质量、保真性和区域控制能力方面优于现有的GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff方法出色地解决了旧照片在人脸恢复中的各种复杂退化问题，在多个指标上超越现有技术，包括在300张图像组成的VintageFace基准上展现了卓越表现。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: 提出了ImageSentinel框架，通过合成哨兵图像有效保护RAIG中的视觉数据集，能够检测未经授权的使用并保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数字水印方法在RAIG系统中面临局限性，因为复杂的特征提取和重组过程无法在生成过程中保留水印信号。

Method: 我们提出了ImageSentinel，一个用于在RAIG中保护视觉数据集的新框架。我们的框架合成了与原始数据集在视觉上保持一致的哨兵图像。这些哨兵通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥，允许进行保护验证。为了确保无缝集成，我们利用视觉-语言模型生成哨兵图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，ImageSentinel在有效检测未经授权的数据集使用的同时，保留了授权应用的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel框架能够有效地保护RAIG系统中的视觉数据集，解决了传统数字水印方法的局限性，确保在保护数据的同时不影响授权应用的生成效果。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过受限优化设计单光子3D成像编码方案，并通过梯度下降算法优化照明和编码矩阵以克服硬件限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决压缩直方图在真实硬件条件下表现不佳的问题。

Method: 使用梯度下降算法联合优化照明和编码矩阵的受限优化方法。

Result: 提出的编码方案在峰值功率受限条件下优势明显，并能适应不理想的系统脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 该优化方法在系统带宽和峰值功率受限条件下，性能优于传统编码设计，并能适应不理想的系统脉冲响应。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

*Xiao Yang,Jiyao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FedHUG框架，通过不依赖标签的数据融合和泛化生理测量模型，在流行算法中展现优异性能，有效应对分布偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于远程生理测量既需要收集用户的隐私敏感信息，又依赖于标记的客户端数据，这给在缺乏标签的大量用户数据的情况下更新和泛化真实世界部署的模型带来了挑战。因此，提出一种新的协议：Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG)，并据此引入了一种新框架FedHUG，以解决这些挑战。

Method: 研究中提出的FedHUG框架包含两个主要模块：最小偏差聚合模块和全球分布感知学习控制器。最小偏差聚合模块通过基于先验驱动的偏差评估动态调整聚合权重，来应对来自多个域的异构非IID特征。全球分布感知学习控制器则用于参数化标签分布，并动态操控客户端特定的训练策略，以缓解服务器-客户端之间的标签分布偏差和长尾问题。

Result: 通过所提框架，研究展示了其在使用RGB视频或mmWave雷达的估计任务中，相较于现有最先进技术，表现出更优异的性能。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种名为FedHUG的框架，该框架在不依赖标记数据的情况下能够有效更新和泛化模型，特别是在具有非独立同分布特征的多域情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless

called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with

*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a novel KFF method for CTTA, effectively balancing old and new knowledge, validated by experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods face performance degradation due to insufficient learning of new knowledge and interference from historical knowledge. The proposed KFF method aims to address these challenges.

Method: The paper proposes a class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission (KFF) method, which includes two modules: the Knowledge Fission (KFI) module to separate new domain knowledge and the Knowledge Fusion (KFU) module to merge new knowledge with existing ones.

Result: Experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the KFF method compared to other existing methods.

Conclusion: KFF method shows improved performance in CTTA scenarios by balancing the preservation of historical knowledge and the adaptation of new knowledge.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

*Ziyuan Gao,Philippe Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩散原型学习框架，通过扩散特征空间探索提高一张图像原型表示的多样性，从而改善医疗图像分割的效果，拓展了腹部MRI和CT数据集上的技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一张图像的医疗图像分割由于标注数据有限和患者之间显著的解剖变异性而面临基础性挑战。传统的原型方法依赖于支持特征的确定性平均，无法捕捉类内多样性，这对于实现稳健的泛化至关重要。为解决这个问题，本文引入了新的扩散原型学习（DPL）框架。

Method: 该研究提出了一种称为扩散原型学习（DPL）的框架，该框架将原型构建重新定义为通过扩散过程进行特征空间的探索。具体包括三个核心创新：（1）扩散原型增强模块，利用向前向后的扩散过程将单一支持原型转换为多样的变体集合；（2）基于空间的条件机制，利用从原型特征统计中衍生的几何属性；（3）保守的融合策略，在最大化表示多样性的同时保留原型的完整性。

Result: 通过在腹部MRI和CT数据集上进行广泛实验，DPL方法在一张图像的医疗图像分割任务中表现出显著的改进，达到了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的方法，通过扩散特征空间探索来进行一张图像的原型学习，从而实现对医疗图像的更为准确的分割。实验证明，该方法在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的表现优于现有技术，实现了新的技术水平。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

### [17] [State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的状态空间提示方法（SSP），结合帧内和帧间提示来聚合视频中的关键时空信息，并在四个视频基准数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了将强大的预训练模型应用于下游任务，提出了提示学习，以通过少量微调参数实现高效的下游任务适应。然而，顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌未能捕捉视频中的空间和时间上下文信息，因此限制了状态压缩模型中视频帧内空间信息和帧间时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 我们提出了一种状态空间提示（SSP）方法用于视频理解，结合帧内提示和帧间提示来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息。具体而言，设计了一个帧内聚合（IFG）模块来聚合每个帧内的空间关键信息，并设计了一个帧间传播（IFS）模块来传播跨帧的判别时空信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了我们的SSP平均比现有SOTA方法高出2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过自适应地平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息，以互补方式有效传播视频中的判别信息，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

*Youngju Yoo,Seho Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D通过一个端到端结构框架，使用学生-教师模型提高3D实例分割的精确度和效率，降低了复杂性和训练时间，在多个实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，这导致了大量的标注成本和劳动负担。为了解决此问题，探索了更加可扩展的盒级标注形式。然而，盒标注在重叠区域中固有的模糊性使得准确的点到实例分配具有挑战性。

Method: BEEP3D采用了一个学生-教师框架，其中教师模型作为伪标签生成器，并通过指数移动平均由学生模型更新。为了更好地引导教师模型生成精确的伪掩码，研究中引入了基于实例中心的查询细化。此外，设计了两种新的损失函数——查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失，以在预测和伪掩码之间对齐语义和几何信号。

Result: BEEP3D在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上表现出色，与现有方法相比，实现了竞争性甚至更优的性能，并且效率高。

Conclusion: BEEP3D在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上实现了与最新的弱监督方法相比有竞争力或更优异的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

TL;DR: CompoDistill enhances visual perception in student models of MLLMs through better visual attention alignment between teacher and student, improving performance on tasks requiring visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitation of current knowledge distillation methods in transferring rich visual perception abilities from large teacher models to smaller student models in Multimodal Large Language Models.

Method: The paper introduces a novel Knowledge Distillation framework called CompoDistill, which focuses on aligning the student model's visual attention with that of the teacher model.

Result: CompoDistill yields significant improvements in compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception and maintains strong results in visual question answering tasks. It also proves effective with advanced backbones, demonstrating its generalizability.

Conclusion: CompoDistill greatly enhances the visual perception abilities of student models in multimodal large language models through better visual attention alignment while preserving existing task performance.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Motivation: 当前的端到端自动驾驶系统在多样化的大规模驾驶数据集上训练后取得了显著进展，但在分布外(OOD)场景中仍然面临挑战。为了弥补这一不足，COOOL基准测试通过鼓励对危险的理解超越封闭的分类法来解决这一差距，而2COOOL挑战则将其扩展到生成可供人类理解的事故报告。

Conclusion: 使用视觉-语言模型的分层推理对事故分析和更广泛的安全关键交通事件的理解是一个有前途的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Motivation: 近年来，视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在推理任务上取得了显著进展，但关于构建高效的VL推理训练数据集的原则仍未明了，因此需要研究如何更好地构建这些数据集以提升推理能力。

Conclusion: 本文展示了改善VL推理数据集策划的策略，并引入了HoneyBee数据集，大大提升了模型的推理能力和性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Conclusion: 该方法在保持并行token预测效率优势的同时，显著提升了生成质量，实现了图像和视频生成任务上的显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的损失函数组合对超参数敏感，且在数据有限的情况下表现不佳。特别是在医疗图像中，由于隐私、伦理和昂贵的标注成本，数据稀缺性尤为突出，因此需要新的、稳健高效的训练目标函数。

Method: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失（Multiplicative Loss）和自信度自适应乘法损失（Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss）。前者将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，动态调节梯度，后者则引入了自信度驱动的指数缩放策略。

Result: 在细胞和医疗分割基准测试中，该框架显示出优于经过调优的现有损失函数组合的表现，证明其在数据有限的条件下具有很好的鲁棒性和效果。

Conclusion: 在医疗和细胞图像的语义分割任务中，所提出的乘法损失和自信度自适应乘法损失函数在极端数据稀缺的情况下表现优异，并且不依赖超参数。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

TL;DR: SpineBench是一个针对脊柱领域的VQA基准，用于评估MLLM的表现，结果显示现有模型在脊柱任务中的表现欠佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准方法无法充分全面评估MLLM在脊柱等需高度依赖视觉输入的细分领域的表现，因此建立一个专门针对脊柱领域的基准是必要的。

Method: SpineBench通过整合开放源脊柱疾病数据集中的图像标签对，并为每个VQA对备选项选择具有视觉相似性的困难负面选项来构建。

Result: 本文介绍了一个名为SpineBench的可视化问答(VQA)基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型(MLLM)在脊柱领域的表现。SpineBench包括从40,263个脊柱图像中提取的64,878个问答对，涵盖11种脊柱疾病，并评估MLLM在脊柱疾病诊断和脊柱病变定位两项关键临床任务中的表现。评估结果表明，现有的MLLM在脊柱任务中表现不佳，反映出当前模型在该领域的局限性。

Conclusion: SpineBench为评估多模态大语言模型在脊柱领域的表现提供了一个综合平台，并揭示了这些模型目前在该领域的不足，为未来的改进提供了参考。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 优先级自适应高斯投影（PAGS）框架通过引入语义优先级优化了动态3D城市场景重建的质量和速度，对安全关键对象效果卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的动态3D城市场景重建方法在效果和计算成本之间存在明显的权衡，这是由于其语义不可知的设计导致资源分配不均，将静态背景和安全关键对象等同对待。因此，为了解决这一问题，需要一种能够在重建过程中动态调整优先级的框架。

Method: 本文提出了优先级自适应高斯投影（PAGS）框架，通过任务感知的语义优先级直接注入到3D重建和渲染管道中。此框架含有两个核心贡献：(1) 语义引导的剪枝和正则化策略，利用混合重要性度量来主动简化非关键场景元素，同时保存导航所需的细粒度细节。(2) 优先级驱动的渲染管道，通过优先级深度预处理过程来主动减少遮挡的元素，从而加速最终的阴影计算。

Result: PAGS在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的广泛实验表明其能够在安全关键对象上实现卓越的重建质量，同时显著减少训练时间并提高渲染速度至超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: 优先级自适应高斯投影（PAGS）框架能够有效引入语义优先级，提高动态3D城市场景的重建质量及渲染速度，特别是在安全关键对象上。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型在处理徽标幻觉问题时的表现，揭示了这些模型在面对不含文字的徽标时产生幻觉的机理，并提出了解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态推理中已经取得进展的视觉语言模型，面对一个常见且被忽视的问题：徽标幻觉，在这种情况下，模型会在未包含任何可见文字的徽标中生成品牌名或文本内容。探索这一现象的根源有助于提升这些模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 研究方法包括通过细致划分的纯符号、混合和带文本徽标数据集，以及Hard-60子集来测量VLMs的幻觉水平，并通过九种结构扰动方法来探讨模型的鲁棒性。研究者还进行了基于开权重LLaVA的嵌入层分析，发现幻觉问题与投影器的特定维度相关，并通过目标消融试验来降低错误率，同时保持光学字符识别（OCR）准确性。

Result: 该研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多模态推理中容易出现幻觉的现象，特别是徽标幻觉问题。研究表明，尽管这些模型在视觉证据不充足的情况下生成输出的能力已有显著进步，但它们依然容易出现与视觉证据无关的结果，这些问题在处理不带有可见文字的徽标时尤其突出。通过对纯符号、混合和带文本徽标的系统化分割测试，研究测量了VLMs的幻觉程度，并探讨了通过多种结构扰动方法来检验模型鲁棒性。研究揭示，尽管存在强烈的失真干扰，幻觉依然存在；研究显示，幻觉与投影器的部分维度直接相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果显示，视觉语言模型在生成品牌名称或文字内容时，往往依赖于符号先验而非真实的字形感知，这种误解在圆形的标志中特别显著。此外，投影器的子空间在幻觉现象中起到了决定性作用。通过投影器去耦和OCR引导的解码方法，可以显著减少错误，为构建更加可信的多模态系统提供新方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过结合高斯斑点和扩散模型，有效地在城市街道场景中实现了新的视图合成，取得了较好的挑战成绩。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: 语义场景完成通过从单目图像推理完整的3D几何和语义，现有方法存在运动推理不足、遮挡和深度监督噪声的问题。CurriFlow框架利用光流和课程引导来改善时间一致性和动态目标理解，在SemanticKITTI基准上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语义场景完成方法在依赖时间堆叠或深度投影时，存在运动推理不充分以及在处理遮挡和噪声深度监督时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为CurriFlow的语义占用预测框架，整合了基于光流的时间对齐和课程引导的深度融合。此外，使用多级融合策略，采用预训练的光流来对齐分割、视觉和深度特征。课程学习机制被用于在训练中从稀疏但准确的LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集但有噪声的立体深度。

Result: CurriFlow的实验结果在SemanticKITTI基准上表现出领先的性能，达到平均IoU为16.9，验证了基于运动引导和课程意识设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CurriFlow框架通过结合光流对齐和课程学习，提高了时间一致性和动态物体理解，并在语义场景完成任务中取得了领先的性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空特征的流程步骤识别模型STORM-PSR，在多个数据集上显著提高了识别速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型仅依赖于单帧视频中的装配对象状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致模型缺乏鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在物体被部分遮挡时。因此，提出了一种结合时空特征来提升识别准确性的方法。

Method: 提出了一种名为STORM-PSR的双流框架模型，结合了空间和时序特征来识别流程步骤的完成情况。其中，空间编码器通过一种新颖的弱监督方法进行预训练以获取有意义的空间表示，而时序编码器则基于Transformer来学习这些空间特征的时间关系。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上进行评估，与之前的方法相比，分别减少了11.2%和26.1%的预测与实际装配步骤完成之间的平均延迟。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR模型的时空流能够在物体视图不完全的情况下推断已完成的步骤，从而减少了预测延迟。这表明结合空间和时间特征对于提高PSR任务的性能至关重要。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Motivation: SCR模型在训练图像无法提供充分的多视角约束时性能下降。为此，我们希望通过概率和高层次重建先验来增强SCR模型的训练，改善其在场景表示和其他应用上的表现。

Method: 我们采用概率重新解释训练SCR模型，通过引入多种高层次重建先验，包括简单的深度值分布和通过3D点云扩散模型学习的场景坐标配置先验。

Result: 我们提出了一种概率重新解释训练场景坐标回归（SCR）模型的方法，这使得我们能够融入高级重建先验知识。我们考虑了多种先验知识，从简单的重构深度值分布的先验到对可行的场景坐标配置的学习先验。通过在大量室内扫描数据上训练3D点云扩散模型，我们的先验在每个训练步骤中将预测的3D场景点推向合理的几何图形，从而增加他们的可能性。实验结果表明，在三个室内数据集上，我们的先验有助于学习更好的场景表示，生成更一致的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位置，对新视图合成和相机重定位等下游任务产生积极影响。

Conclusion: 引入概率重建先验显著提升了场景坐标回归模型在室内场景上的表现，有助于产生更一致的3D场景点云和更精确的相机姿态。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Motivation: 提高低场磁共振成像（LF-MRI）的诊断质量，同时不需要昂贵的基础设施。

Method: CFM通过最优速度场的直接回归学习从噪声分布到目标数据分布的连续流来实现重构高场磁共振图像。

Result: 实验结果表明，CFM不仅实现了先进的性能，还能够稳健地泛化到分布内和分布外的数据，并且使用的参数显著少于竞争性的深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM有潜力成为MRI重建的强大且可扩展的工具，尤其是在资源有限的临床环境中。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联动优化对抗样本的可转移性和不可察觉性，展现了在黑箱设置下对抗深度伪造检测的新前景，并提高了攻击成功率。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Motivation: The paper aims to address the numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability found in neural methods for learning Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs).

Method: The approach assigns bi-directional normals to input points using Voronoi-based criteria, diffuses them to form a UDF gradient field, and integrates it to obtain the UDF.

Result: The Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD) method is computationally efficient and stable, capable of handling both simple and complex 3D shapes, including non-manifold and non-orientable geometries.

Conclusion: Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD) is effective in computing Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) from unoriented point clouds, providing stability and efficiency even for complex geometries.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用评分扩散模型进行无条件人类动作生成的方法，能达至先进水平，并避免了传统方法需从关节恢复形状的步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类动作生成的很多方法依赖于过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失，但这些策略对于扩散模型来说不应是必要的。作者认为扩散模型可以在不依赖过度参数化和辅助损失的情况下达到先进水平。这推动了他们开发一种基于评分的扩散模型。

Result: 本文提出一种基于评分的扩散模型，通过精心的特征空间规范化和解析导出的权重来改进L2评分匹配损失，从而在无条件人类动作生成方面取得了与最先进结果相当的效果。此外，该模型能够直接生成动作和形状，从而避免了从关节缓慢恢复形状的过程。

Conclusion: 提出的模型通过精心的特征空间规范化和解析导出的权重，可以在无条件人类动作生成方面取得与最先进结果相当的表现，并能直接生成动作和形状，简化了形状恢复过程。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下性能下降，缺少专门的多光谱无人机数据集限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出了一种新的多光谱和方向感知多目标跟踪方案，包括：集成光谱特征的轻量级光谱3D-Stem、用于精确状态估计的方向感知卡尔曼滤波器、端到端的方向自适应变压器。

Result: 通过实验，验证了多光谱输入对小型和密集对象的跟踪性能显著优于RGB基线。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了多光谱输入相比RGB基线在小型和密集对象的跟踪性能的显著提升，推动了无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意机制融合条件与运动，但在保持逐步的时间对齐上存在困难。

Method: 引入了一种基于 Mamba 的新模型 Temporally Conditional Mamba，用于人类运动生成，将条件信息集成到 Mamba 块的递归动态中。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在时间对齐、运动真实感和条件一致性方面显著优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 模型在各种人类运动任务中验证有效，显著优于现有方法，提升时间对齐和运动真实感。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 利用Plantnet模型和Segment Anything Model（SAM），提出了一种用于农业图像的零样本分割的新方法，减少标注瓶颈并提高分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在农业成像领域，数据采集与标注成本高昂，而现有监督方法在复杂田间环境的表现受到限制，研究意图寻求无需大量人工标注的数据处理方法。

Method: 使用Plantnet和其DinoV2骨干网及SAM模型，首先利用Plantnet生成粗分割掩模，再通过SAM精细化这些掩模以进行详细分割，而无需收集和标注新的数据集。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上进行评估，通过Jaccard Index (IoU)测量，在使用经Plantnet微调的DinoV2模型与基础DinoV2模型相比，显示出一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，将基础模型与植物专业模型结合能够减轻标注负担，并在多样化农业场景中实现有效的分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync方法优化了扩散模型的生成质量与训练效率，无需外部指导，适用于多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究指出扩散模型的生成质量与其所学习的表示之间存在联系。LayerSync通过利用模型内部最语义丰富的表示来指导较弱的表示，从而减少对外部监督的依赖，提升训练效率和生成质量。

Method: LayerSync通过利用扩散模型自身的中间表示来进行正则化，实现了对模型生成质量的优化。这种方法无需依赖预训练模型或额外数据，可以无缝地集成到不同类型的数据生成任务中，如图像、音频、视频和运动生成。特定情况下，它大幅提高了流模型变压器在ImageNet数据集上的训练速度和生成质量。

Result: LayerSync是一种用于提高扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率的无域约束方法。通过自我调节扩散模型内部的中间表示，LayerSync减少了对外部指导的需求。它作为一种独立的插件式正则化项，不会给扩散模型的训练带来额外负担，并可以一般化应用于视觉领域以外的其他模态，比如音频、视频和运动生成。

Conclusion: LayerSync方法在提高扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率方面表现出色。该方法无需预训练模型或额外数据，且适用于图像、音频、视频和运动生成等多个领域。通过自我调节模型中间表示，它减少了外部监督的需求，并可作为插件使用而不增加训练负担。实验结果表明，该方法加快了ImageNet数据集上流模型变压器的训练速度，并显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at
https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

TL;DR: 引入两阶段训练框架显著提升了像素空间生成模型在ImageNet上的性能，超越以往方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间生成模型在训练上较困难且性能一般不如潜在空间模型，因此需要一种新的方法来提高其效率和表现。

Method: 首先预训练编码器以从清晰图像中捕获有意义的语义，并将其与沿确定性采样轨迹的点对齐；然后将编码器与随机初始化的解码器集成，并端到端微调整个模型。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，像素空间扩散模型在低评估次数下实现了优异的FID分数，超过了之前的方法；一致性模型也在高分辨率图像上实现了首次成功训练，性能显著超过了潜在空间模型。

Conclusion: 通过引入一种新颖的两阶段训练框架，成功提升了像素空间生成模型的性能和效率，缩小了与潜在空间模型的差距。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Method: 作者提出了一种名为IVT-LR的新方法，通过在潜在空间中注入视觉和文本信息来进行多模态推理。该方法结合了隐含的文本信息和视觉信息，以减少注释需求和提高推理效率。

Result: 通过在M3CoT和ScienceQA上进行的实验，IVT-LR方法在准确率上平均提高了5.45%，同时实现了推理速度超过现有方法5倍的提升。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法在减少注释需求和提高推理效率方面表现优异，并能显著提高推理准确率和速度。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Motivation: The study addresses the challenges in underwater salient object detection, such as image quality degradation and domain gaps, and the limitations of existing methods that overlook underwater physical principles or treat degradations merely as interference.

Method: WaterFlow is a rectified flow-based framework that integrates underwater physical imaging information directly into network training, along with the introduction of temporal dimension modeling, to enhance salient object detection capabilities.

Result: WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m on the USOD10K dataset, indicating improved performance in salient object detection for underwater applications.

Conclusion: WaterFlow shows a significant improvement in salient object detection in underwater images when tested on the USOD10K dataset, with a notable gain in specific performance metrics, proving its effectiveness and superiority over previous methods.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Motivation: 开发简洁高效的模型以进行人体网格恢复（HMR）和人体姿态估计（HPE）任务。

Method: 构建轻量化HMR2.0变体并使用Swin Transformer等层次化视觉基础模型的早期阶段作为编码器进行评估与对比。

Result: 通过对比27种模型，发现使用层次化视觉基础模型的前两到三个阶段可以实现与全阶段模型相当的性能，并且在准确性和计算效率之间取得更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 仅使用层次化视觉基础模型的早期阶段即可实现有效的人体网格恢复和姿态估计，且与现有的轻量化模型相比具有较好的性能和计算效率平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM)方法，通过引入无监督的证据损失聚类方法和剩余流匹配机制来提高标签可靠性意识及不确定性传递路径的多样性，旨在提升在开放集域泛化中的表现。


<details>

Conclusion: EReLiFM在有标签噪声的开放集域泛化任务中取得了当前最优的表现，根据实验结果，其性能优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中表现优秀，但容易学习到虚假相关性，导致偏差和有限的泛化能力。人类与AI注意力对齐可以缓解这些问题，但往往需要高昂的人力监督。

Method: 使用自监督和人类指导约束相结合的方式进行学习，并采用混合解释指导学习框架。

Result: 在使用Vision Transformer进行胸部X光分类时，H-EGL优于两种最先进的解释指导学习方法，表现出更高的分类准确性和泛化能力，并且产生的注意力图更符合人类专家的看法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种混合解释指导学习（H-EGL）框架，该框架结合了自监督和人类指导约束，以增强注意力对齐和改善泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

Motivation: 填补现有基准的空白，推动多模态大语言模型从被动的视觉感知向可操控的认知工作空间转变。

Method: 引入IRIS，一个评估多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉文本任务下使用图像进行动态推理的基准。

Result: 现有多模态大语言模型在think with images范式下的通过率较低，最高模型仅达18.68%。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大语言模型在需要有效集成视觉和通用工具的任务中表现不佳，IRIS评估提供了改进视智的深入洞察。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model

tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 基础模型在医疗保健应用中潜力巨大，但微调仍必不可少。本文提出了一种新的个性化联邦微调方法以解决数据共享限制，取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗保健中，即使是经过健康数据预训练的基础模型，仍然需要为特定任务进行微调。目前获取足够的数据仍然是一大挑战。

Method: 本文提出了一种新方法，使用去关联的LoRA适配器进行个性化联邦微调，以解构通用和客户端特定的知识。

Result: 在实际联邦医学成像任务中的预实验结果表明，该方法在与当前的联邦微调方法竞争时具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的个性化联邦微调方法，通过去关联LoRA适配器来解构通用和客户端特定知识。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: FlashVSR是一种提高效率和实时视频超分辨率性能的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型应用于真实世界的视频超分辨率上存在挑战。

Method: 提出了FlashVSR，一种基于扩散的一步流媒体框架，以实现实时视频超分辨率。

Result: FlashVSR能够以约17 FPS的速度在单个A100 GPU上处理768x1408的视频。

Conclusion: FlashVSR实现了与现有一步扩散视频超分辨率模型相比高达12倍的速度提升，并达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为SPORTS的新框架，通过整合视频泛分割、视觉里程计和场景渲染任务，改善场景感知和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 场景感知、理解和模拟是具身智能体的基本技术，但现有解决方案仍容易出现分割缺陷、动态对象干扰、传感器数据稀疏性和视图限制问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的框架，名为SPORTS，通过紧密整合视频泛分割（VPS）、视觉里程计（VO）和场景渲染（SR）任务，以迭代和统一的视角进行整体场景理解。VPS设计了一种自适应的基于注意力的几何融合机制，通过使用姿态、深度和光流模态来对齐跨帧特征，自动调整不同解码阶段的特征图。VO中，将VPS的泛分割结果与光流图结合，以提高动态对象置信度评估，同时通过基于学习的范式提高相机姿态估计的准确性和深度图生成的完整性。SR的基于点的渲染借助VO，将稀疏点云转换为神经场以合成高保真RGB视图和双泛分割视图。

Result: 我们的注意力特征融合方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视图合成任务上优于现有大多数最新技术。

Conclusion: 通过在三个公共数据集上进行广泛实验，验证了我们的方法在多个任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入VQArt-Bench以更好评估多模态模型的视觉理解能力，揭示了当前模型在某些基本任务上的性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉问答基准未能评估模型在复杂领域的深层语义理解，限制了模型发挥其在视觉艺术分析等领域的能力，因此引入新的基准，以更好地评估模型的视觉推理能力。

Method: 引入VQArt-Bench作为新的大型VQA基准，该基准通过新颖的多智能体管道构建，专门用于生成复杂和语言多样化的问题，以解决模型在视觉推理中存在的统计捷径问题。

Result: 通过在VQArt-Bench上评估14个先进的MLLMs，发现这些模型在解释符号意义、叙述和复杂视觉关系方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的多模态大型语言模型在VQA方面存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的弱点以及专有模型与开源模型之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种无监督框架，通过隐式正则化同时优化自运动和光流估计，性能优秀，具备无监督任务的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中，由于关联数据不够稳健，传统的分别解决光流和6自由度自运动问题的方法在缺少监督的情况下是病态的，研究旨在通过无监督框架来改进这一问题。

Method: 该方法将摄像机的自运动建模为连续样条光流的隐式神经表示，利用结构和运动先验通过微分几何约束，规避了显式深度估计，同时保持严格的几何一致性。

Result: 实验显示，该框架在通用6自由度运动场景中表现出色，达到无监督方法的最先进性能，甚至与监督方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种无监督框架，通过隐式的时空和几何正则化来联合优化自运动和光流估计，实现了在无监督的情况下统一这两个任务。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部正电子发射断层扫描（PET）成像中，头部运动会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取定量不准确，因此需要有效的头部运动估计和校正，以便进行精确的定量图像分析和神经疾病的准确诊断。

Method: 提出了一种名为DL-HMC++的深度学习头部运动校正方法，通过跨注意力机制来预测来自一秒3D PET原始数据的刚性头部运动。DL-HMC++在监督模式下进行训练，利用现有的动态PET扫描和来自外部HMT的黄金标准运动测量进行训练。

Result: DL-HMC++在两个PET扫描仪（HRRT和mCT）和四种示踪剂（18F-FDG, 18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, 和 11C-LSN3172176）上的表现证明了其有效性和泛化能力。在大量队列PET研究中，DL-HMC++始终优于最先进的数据驱动运动估计方法，生成无运动伪影的图像，并且这些图像与黄金标准HMT无异。脑区域感兴趣标称摄取值分析显示，DL-HMC++与黄金标准HMT的平均差异比率分别为HRRT的1.2±0.5%和mCT的0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动的PET头部运动校正的潜力，能够消除HMT的负担，使运动校正在研究之外的临床人群中也能实现。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

TL;DR: AnyUp是一种无需重新训练的新型特征上采样方法，在推理时能够有效泛化和提升上采样质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的上采样器需要针对不同的特征提取器重新训练，因此在推理时无法泛化到不同的特征类型。

Method: 提出了一种名为AnyUp的特征上采样方法，该方法可以应用于任意分辨率的视觉特征，无需针对特定编码器进行训练。

Result: AnyUp在上采样特征方面设立了新的技术标准，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，并在保持特征语义的同时高效且易于应用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过引入推理阶段特征无关的上采样架构，AnyUp改善了上采样质量，简化了应用过程并设立了新的性能标准。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 尽管在高效的PSNR导向超分辨率方面取得了显著进展，但关注感知质量指标的方法仍相对低效。因此希望在感知结果方面复制或改进Real-ESRGAN，同时满足苛刻的效率约束。

Method: 采用设计目标的解决方案，在一个全新的500张4K分辨率的测试图像数据集上进行评估，每张图像经过多种退化类型处理，而不提供原始高质量图像。

Conclusion: 这篇论文确立了高效感知超分辨率的现代基准，并展示了高效方法在感知领域的潜力，超越了所有基准数据集上的Real-ESRGAN。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

TL;DR: USplat4D通过引入不确定性感知的方法，有效改善了动态3D场景的重建质量，尤其是在遮挡和极端视角下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的动态高斯点云模型在处理单目输入的动态3D场景重建时，由于忽略了高斯点云的观测情况，导致在遮挡和不常见视角下运动漂移和合成质量下降的问题。为解决此问题，引入不确定性是必要的。

Method: 引入了一种新的不确定性感知动态高斯点云框架USplat4D，该框架通过估计每个高斯的不确定性并利用其构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化来改进4D重构。

Result: 实验结果表明，显式建模不确定性能够一致地改进动态高斯点云模型，改善其在遮挡情况下的几何稳定性，并增强其在极端视点下的合成质量。

Conclusion: 通过在动态高斯点云模型中显式建模不确定性，USplat4D能够在遮挡情况下提供更稳定的几何结构，并在极端视点下实现高质量的合成。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Motivation: 旨在解决统一多模态模型强大的视觉理解能力未能有效转移到视觉生成的问题，通过自我奖励框架改善生成性能。

Method: 设计了全球-局部双重奖励系统，提供多尺度的指导，对整体视觉语义和布局的正确性进行全球奖励，同时对细粒度、对象级别的逼真度提供局部奖励来细化。

Conclusion: SRUM在无需额外人工标注数据的情况下，实现了模型自我改进，显著提升了生成性能，从82.18提高到88.37，以及从43.82提高到46.75。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法只允许关于场景动态单一实现的密集采样，该方法导致对多模态运动预测和依赖物理交互的不确定性理解有限。

Method: 提出了Flow Poke Transformer (FPT)框架，用于基于局部相互作用“戳”来预测局部运动分布。同时对该模型在多任务中进行了评估。

Result: 在密集人脸运动生成以及合成数据集上的强输出分布任务方面，FPT超过了现有的方法，并在运动分割等任务中表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了Flow Poke Transformer，提供了一种灵活的方式来预测多模态场景运动，并在多个任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Motivation: 当前创建和制作拟真人物数字化身的过程成本高、耗时长，需要大量的专业3D艺术家手动工作。新方法希望通过单个随意抓拍的参考图像自动生成生动的虚拟化身，从而降低创建成本并增强逼真度，但其呈现各个视角时的画质和真实度有所下降。因此，提出改进方案。

Conclusion: MVP4D通过先进的视频扩散模型，实现了从单个参考图像和目标表情生成可动画的多视角数字人视频，并可实时渲染，提升了虚拟人形象的真实感、一致性和一致性。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构依赖于独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了模型的跨模态推理和知识转移能力。

Method: 使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型（VLM）作为统一多模态编码器，并引入层级注意力池化（LAP）机制，以及VLM支持的重写注入与灵活推理（VERIFI）机制。

Result: LAP机制在文本-图像生成的对齐和视觉信息传递上表现优于其他浅融合架构，模型在微调编辑任务后，不仅改善了文本-图像生成的对齐，还展现了出色的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion通过使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型（VLM）作为统一的多模态编码器，实现了更高效的跨模态推理和知识转移。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

TL;DR: 研究提出视觉一致性学习（ViCO），通过根据图像语义复杂性调整视觉标记数量以降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态大语言模型由于图像输入导致推理成本增加的问题。

Method: 研究采用多个MLP连接器，根据不同的图像压缩比对视觉标记进行下采样，并通过最小化不同MLP连接器条件下响应的KL散度来训练模型。推理时使用视觉分辨率路由器（ViR）来选择适当的压缩率。

Result: 这项研究提出了一种新的训练算法，称为视觉一致性学习（ViCO），通过根据图像的语义复杂性选择不同数量的视觉标记来减少推理成本。研究显示，这种方法能够在保持模型感知、推理和光学字符识别能力的同时，将视觉标记的数量最多减少50%。

Conclusion: 新方法能够有效减少视觉标记的数量，并保持模型性能，从而提高现有多模态大语言模型的效率。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，利用世界建模预测未来图像，生成高密度的自监督信号，具体实现包括自动回归世界模型和扩散世界模型，并引入轻量级动作专家。

Result: DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线，且在数据集规模增加时性能提升速度加快。

Conclusion: DriveVLA-W0的训练范式能够有效克服监督不足问题，使得随着数据集增长，模型性能加速提升，为实现更通用的驾驶智能提供了新的路径。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Motivation: 弥合传统坐标回归模型和多模态大模型在目标检测任务中的差距，克服低召回率、重复预测、坐标不对齐等挑战。

Method: 提出了Rex-Omni方法，其中包括特殊令牌来表示量化坐标、构建数据引擎产生高质量语义监督数据、以及两阶段训练流程结合基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS等基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到了与或超过回归模型的性能。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni通过三大关键设计解决了传统坐标回归模型面临的挑战，实现了领先的目标感知性能。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在逻辑理解与语言流畅性之间存在差距，尤其在处理修改后的逻辑谜题时表现欠佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLM）在解决经典逻辑谜题时表现良好，但在面对稍作修改的谜题时，其性能显著下降，暴露了其脆弱性。研究旨在探讨LLM在处理此类问题时的能力及其局限性。

Method: 研究引入了PHANTOM RECALL基准，包括25个知名逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动。评估了11个领先的LLM，通过自动逻辑等价评判、细粒度推理错误分类和基于提示的缓解框架来研究和缓解幻影回忆问题。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLM在未修改的谜题上表现近乎完美，但在人类处理扰动更改上表现不佳，展示了幻影回忆和过度复杂化的问题。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在逻辑推理能力方面存在显著局限，特别是在需要重新推理的情况下，这与其在未修改谜题上的高表现形成对比。解决这一问题需要更好地设计提示和识别推理错误的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Motivation: 解决LLM在建模复杂环境动态方面的固有局限性，特别是长时程模拟中的错误累积问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为R-WoM（基于检索增强的世界模型）的新方法，通过从外部教程中检索事实性、最新的知识来支持LLM的模拟。

Result: 在OSWorld和WebArena环境中，相较于基线方法，R-WoM分别实现了高达25.3%和18.1%的显著改进。

Conclusion: 提高了长时程的模拟性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在输入变化时表现出脆弱性，可能因为内部知识表示不稳健，影响真实性探测工具的效用和模型稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使大型语言模型（LLMs）可靠，它们必须学习可以在不同环境中普遍应用的稳健知识。然而，LLM的性能可能是脆弱的，对输入的微小变化表现出过度敏感。本文探讨这种脆弱性是否直接源于不稳定的内部知识表示。

Method: 本研究通过评估表示可分离性来测试所学知识的稳健性，方法是对样本进行表面变换使其超出分布（OOD），如拼写错误或重述，然后应用语义保持的扰动，研究随着样本呈现形式越来越不类似于预训练数据时表示的衰减。

Result: 研究结果显示，当样本的呈现形式变得与预训练数据不相似时，关于陈述真实性的内部表示会崩溃。虽然LLM可以区分接近预训练数据的真实和虚假的陈述，但这种能力高度依赖于陈述的确切表面形式。

Conclusion: 发现LLM可能学习了浅层的非稳健知识表示，这种表示的泛化能力有限。这项研究提出了真实性探测工具的基本挑战，并呼吁进一步研究以提高学习知识表示的稳健性。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在机器翻译任务中使用大型推理模型生成中间"思考"标记的影响。研究发现，这些标记对提高翻译效果没有帮助，但使用模块化提示策略构建中间标记能带来改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型在数学和编码任务中的能力广为人知，其在机器翻译任务中的影响尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在探讨机器翻译任务中生成中间标记的潜在益处。

Method: 研究通过比较两种模型训练方式，探索中间标记对机器翻译任务的影响。这两种方式分别为使用合成的推理过程解释进行模型微调，以及标准输入输出微调。

Result: 研究结果表明，使用合成推理过程的模型微调没有超越标准输入输出微调。然而，通过组合模块化翻译特定提示策略的方法构建的中间标记可以改进翻译效果。这强调了中间标记在微调过程中的贡献很大程度上依赖于其包含的翻译尝试。

Conclusion: 生成中间"思考"标记并不能帮助大型推理模型更好地执行机器翻译任务。但是，通过模块化翻译特定提示策略构建的中间标记可以带来翻译效果的提高。因此，利用教师来优化目标翻译或扩大平行语料库比将推理解释蒸馏到"思考"翻译模型中更为有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

Conclusion: 实验结果和分析表明，Omni-Detective能够生成高质量的详细字幕，Omni-Cloze在评估此类详细字幕方面表现优越。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TopoAlign的框架，通过将代码分解成文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，并重新组装这些组件以结构上模拟正式数学陈述，从而解锁广泛可用的代码库作为数学大型语言模型（Math LLMs）的训练资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于目前数学LLMs训练所需的大规模语料库稀缺，特别是包含非正式和正式语句对的语料库匮乏，因此提出一种新方法来利用现有的代码库提升数学LLMs的性能。

Method: 提出TopoAlign框架，将代码分解成相应的组件（文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数），并将这些组件重新组装为与正式数学陈述结构上相似的形式，以此生成用于训练Math LLMs的结构对齐代码数据。

Result: TopoAlign显著提升了DeepSeek-Math模型在BEq@10和typecheck@10指标上的表现，甚至对于Herald这种专门化模型，也在这两个指标上实现了小幅提升。

Conclusion: TopoAlign框架能够有效提高数学大型语言模型的性能，即便对于已经专门化的模型，其在BEq@10和typecheck@10指标上也展现了明显的改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

TL;DR: 提出GRAVITY框架，减少对人工注释的依赖，通过合成个人资料偏好数据提升内容生成的个性化和用户参与度。评估结果显示其在多个文化中具有显著优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的个性化通常依赖于昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，这限制了可扩展性并忽视了深层次的用户属性。为了减少对人工注释的依赖，提出了GRAVITY框架，以生成合成的、基于个人资料的偏好数据，涵盖用户的兴趣、价值观、信念和性格特征。

Method: 整合人口统计、文化和心理学框架，包括Hofstede的文化维度、Schwartz的基本价值观、世界价值观调查、以及大五人格OCEAN特征，以生成指导个性化内容生成的偏好对。通过在书籍描述生成任务中与基于提示的条件、标准微调和简单合成对生成进行比较来评估其有效性。

Result: 在评估中，GRAVITY在为400名亚马逊用户生成书籍描述时表现优于传统的方法，尤其是在多个文化（美国、巴西、日本、印度）中实现了超过4%的偏好增益。用户研究表明，GRAVITY的输出在超过86%的情况下更受用户喜爱。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，场景驱动的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户变化，减少对昂贵注释的依赖，并产生更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

Conclusion: CRUMQs提高了多跳问题的难度，有助于检测现有RAG系统的局限性，促进其改进。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DMTD leverages late LLM layers for multi-token generation, enhancing speed with little performance tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the efficiency of large language models in generating tokens by reducing the need for repeated processing in different layers of the model.

Method: Propose the Direct Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD) approach that utilizes the late layers of LLMs to generate multiple tokens at once, without re-processing input through early and middle layers.

Result: The fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model achieved up to a 2x speedup with minimal performance loss, and future improvements are anticipated with larger datasets.

Conclusion: DMTD shows potential to improve LLM efficiency by speeding-up token generation without significant drawbacks.

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文揭示猜想在数学自动形式化中的重要性，提出针对推测能力的新评估框架和方法，并成功改善模型在实际问题上的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多数学问题在形式化前需进行推测，而大语言模型在自动形式化上已面临挑战，推测能力的评估有限且常与自动形式化或证明纠缠不清，因此难以理解其影响。

Method: 改进现有数据集以创建ConjectureBench，并重新设计评估框架和指标，以专门评估大语言模型的推测能力。还设计了一种在推理时使用的方法，Lean-FIRe，以改善推测和自动形式化。

Result: 研究发现当考虑到推测这一因素时，模型表现被显著高估。使用创新方法Lean-FIRe首次成功实现对13个PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化。

Conclusion: 此研究揭示了在自动形式化过程中，猜想是被忽视但却至关重要的一步。论文强调了在评估自学习模型的推测能力时应将其视为一种独立任务，并指出在自动形式化中正确整合推测的必要性。研究指出现有模型的表现常被高估，并提供了前瞻性指导以改善这一领域。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动问题生成系统在生成具有用户定义约束的命题时表现出低效和问题难度不均的现象，因此研究者提出了一种新的方法来改进这一问题，特别是在在线教学环境中，抄袭现象越发普遍。

Method: 研究者使用一种形式化语言定义逻辑等价性问题，并将其转化为两组生成规则，开发了一种线性时间算法用于问题生成。

Result: 通过两次实验验证，该研究的方法生成的问题在准确性和难度方面均与传统教科书中的问题相当，从而确认了新方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的自动问题生成（AQG）方法，能够生成具有逻辑等价性的离散数学问题，并证明其生成的问题在准确性和难度上与教科书问题相当。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

TL;DR: LLM系统在农业信息提取中表现优异，但需要权衡性能与效率等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息提取领域正逐渐转向大规模语言模型，忽略了多年积累的符号或统计模型的经验。本文旨在比较一种神经符号系统和一种LLM系统在农业领域的表现。

Method: 通过在农业领域的九次访谈数据来评估两种不同的系统。

Result: LLM系统在信息提取性能上优于神经符号系统，尽管两者各有优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在实际应用中需权衡NLP系统在性能、效率与可控性方面的重要性。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

TL;DR: CPR可有效改善大语言模型的响应质量，减少误导性生成内容，显著提高成功率。

Motivation: 大语言模型生成误导性信息的一个常见原因是用户提供了结构不良或模糊的提示。为了减少这种因不良提示引起的幻觉现象，该研究开发了CPR框架。

Method: 引入了一个可插拔的Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR)框架，该框架通过清理不良结构的提示并生成额外的信息任务描述，利用微调的小型语言模型来校准用户意图和提示。

Result: 该研究提出了一种名为Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR)的框架，用于改善大语言模型生成的响应质量，特别是在用户使用不明确或结构不良的提示时。结果表明，CPR显著提高了生成质量，减少了幻觉的生成。实证研究显示，使用CPR处理的提示在没有任何外部知识的情况下，赢得了超过90%的成功率。

Conclusion: CPR框架通过精细化和扩充用户的提示，改善了语言模型的性能，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言理解和生成任务中表现性能强劲，但幻觉生成仍是一个挑战，而这些幻觉的产生部分原因在于提示的格式不当。本文的动机在于解决这个未被充分探索的问题，改进不当格式的提示，以提高模型输出的准确性。

Method: 文章介绍了一种名为多阶段提示改进（MPR）的框架，通过针对特定错误（如标点、拼写错误及术语误用）进行细化改进提示，逐步提高提示的清晰度，并通过自反思机制与排序机制来优先处理最相关的输入。

Result: 通过多阶段提示改进（MPR）框架提升了大语言模型生成输出的准确性，尤其是在减少幻觉生成方面表现优异。在实验结果中，利用MPR改进的提示达到85%以上的表现胜率。

Conclusion: MPR框架能够系统地提高提示质量，减少幻觉生成，并与其他现有的幻觉减缓框架相结合，进一步增强其适应性和效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）的不断发展，其在实际应用中的可靠性和可信性问题愈加突出。本文旨在通过不确定性量化（UQ）解决这些问题，以提高模型输出的可靠性，特别是在防止模型产生幻觉时的应用。

Method: 作者首先介绍了不确定性量化（UQ）的基础理论，包括知识不确定性（epistemic）与随机性不确定性（aleatoric）之间的传统区别。接着，讨论了这些概念在大语言模型（LLMs）中的应用，尤其是在幻觉检测中的作用。最后，系统性地对现存方法进行了分类，并展示了若干代表性方法的实证结果。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化（UQ）在提高大语言模型（LLMs）可靠性方面具有重要作用，特别是在幻觉检测领域。尽管现存方法具有局限性，但UQ为提高模型信任度提供了原则性的方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Result: 提示重写器在提升图像-文本对齐、视觉质量和美学效果方面表现优异，并且在不同的T2I模型间展示出强大的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 提示重写是提升文本到图像系统的一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hierarchical Alignment refines model layers selectively, improving LLM performance without the usual trade-offs noted in standard alignment methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study challenges the monolithic approach that applies uniform optimization across all layers in LLMs, aiming to exploit the functional specialization of different layers in Transformer architectures for more effective model alignment.

Method: The paper introduces Hierarchical Alignment, which involves applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to specific functional blocks of a model's layers—local, intermediate, and global—using LoRA for surgical fine-tuning.

Result: Experimental results on advanced models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B show significant improvements in grammatical fluency, factual consistency, and logical coherence through targeted layer adjustments, avoiding the typical trade-offs of standard DPO.

Conclusion: Hierarchical Alignment offers a more efficient and effective approach to LLM alignment by applying targeted adjustments to specific layers, leading to enhanced grammatical fluency, factual consistency, and logical coherence without incurring an 'alignment tax.'

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Method: 提出了一种名为APCE的算法，该算法通过低维语义相似性匹配选择输入中最重要的片段，从而解决长上下文变换模型中内存占用和性能退化的问题。

Result: 通过实验证明，APCE在长文本摘要任务中表现优异，与全密集基线相比，只使用50%-70%的输入序列即可实现相当或更好的摘要性能，同时提高了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为APCE的上下文感知解决方案，能够通过低维语义相似性匹配，从输入中选择出最重要的片段。这种方法在长文本摘要任务中表现出色，与标准的全密集基线相比，能够在使用输入序列的一部分（50%-70%）的情况下实现KV缓存和自注意力内存的效率提升。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理心理健康危机时常常给出有害或不当的建议，因此需要一个更加安全有效的行为健康安全过滤器。

Method: 该研究评估了Verily行为健康安全过滤器（VBHSF）在两个数据集上的表现：Verily心理健康危机数据集和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集，使用临床医师标注的数据进行了评估，并与两种开源的内容审核工具进行了比较。

Result: VBHSF在Verily心理健康危机数据集上的灵敏度为0.990，特异性为0.992，F1分数为0.939；在NVIDIA Aegis AI数据集上的灵敏度为0.982，准确率为0.921，尽管特异性有所降低。在与其他内容审核系统的比较中，VBHSF表现出更高的灵敏度和特定情况下的特异性。

Conclusion: VBHSF在识别心理健康危机方面表现出优异的灵敏度和总体性能，优于其他开源的内容审核系统。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Method: 提出了PACE方法，通过让LLMs生成平行联想链来评估其创造力。

Result: PACE方法与Chatbot Arena Creative Writing排名之间显示出高度相关性，Spearman's $\rho = 0.739$，$p < 0.001$。通过对比分析发现人类和LLMs在联想创造力上表现出不同的模式，人类展现出更大的多样性和更高的完成水平。

Conclusion: 高性能的LLMs在创意表现上可以达到与普通人类似的水平，但专业人士的表现仍显著优于LLMs。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =

comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Motivation: 通过研究LLM在ML-DA过程中的学习动态来更好地理解领域知识在语言内的学习和跨语言的转移过程。

Method: 提出了AdaXEval，一种通过在与训练相同的双语领域语料库上构建多项选择QA数据集的自适应评估方法，通过LLM的连续训练，跟踪LLMs如何获取领域事实并查明知识转化的机制。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Method: 引入SafeMT基准和对话安全指数（SI），并评估多模态大型语言模型在多轮对话中的安全性，同时提出对话安全管理员来检测对话中的恶意意图。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Credal Transformer，通过不确定性量化减少LLMs的幻觉现象，并显著减少无法回答问题的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs由于Transformer's Softmax函数导致的不确定信息被丢弃，出现事实性错误以及过于自信的断言。

Method: 使用基于证据理论的信任注意机制(CAM)替代标准注意力机制，通过调整注意力分数的概念，将其视为Dirichlet分布的证据量。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入，量化模糊性，并显著减少在无法回答的问题上的自信错误，通过放弃回答此类问题。

Conclusion: Credal Transformer通过引入不确定性量化，显著降低了在无法回答的问题上的自信错误，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Conclusion: 连续空间推理模型需要优化表示准确性，并在推理过程中引入归纳偏差以区分正确和错误推理。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Motivation: 现有方法在很大程度上忽视了现实世界实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，而这对于确定药物与特定治疗是否兼容至关重要。

Method: 通过从大型语言模型(LLM)中提取语义丰富的治疗相关文本表示，并使用这些表示来微调知识图谱嵌入(KGE)模型。

Conclusion: LLaDR显著提高了生物医学概念的表示能力，增强了对研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理方面的应用日益广泛，但它们在事件发生时间定位方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。因此，研究通过系统研究来揭示这些模型在时间戳预测上的局限性。

Method: 研究采用对比实验的方法，使用带有时间戳的数据集来测量大音频语言模型在时间预测上的偏差，提出了时间偏差指数（TBI）来量化这一效应，并提供了一个可视化框架以辅助分析。

Result: 研究发现大音频语言模型在时间戳预测上存在系统性偏差，该偏差在不同数据集和模型中普遍存在，并且随着音频长度的增加而增大，不同事件类型和位置的偏差有所变化。这一发现强调了当前模型在时间预测上的基本局限性，呼吁开发更具时间鲁棒性的模型架构。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大音频语言模型在事件时间定位上存在系统性偏差，尤其是在预测时间戳时。实验还表明，偏差随着音频时长的增加而加大，并在不同事件类型和位置上有所变化。因此，需要开发更具时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

Motivation: 现有的分割模型虽经过预训练且较传统方法更稳健，但由于受到监督学习目标的限制，未能结合人类偏好对齐，这对自然的实时翻译至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLMs）的分割框架，通过直接偏好优化（DPO）进行训练，以实现自然的分割点预测，更好地满足即时翻译的需求。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过DPO调整的大语言模型在分割准确率上优于SHAS，并在翻译质量（BLEU，COMET）和延迟（平均滞后）上实现了持续改善。

Conclusion: 研究表明，经过偏好调整的大语言模型能够超越现有的预训练分割模型，提高自适应和人性化的即时传译能力。

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Method: 通过在三个开放权重的大型语言模型上进行层修补分析，研究LLMs中的Knobe效应的表现和其溯源的模型组件。

Result: 研究发现偏见不仅在微调过程中学会，而且本地化于一组特定的层。通过在关键层中插入预训练模型的激活，就能消除偏见效果。

Conclusion: 社会偏见可以通过对LLMs的特定层进行有针对性的干预来解释、定位和减轻，而无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多文档问答任务中存在处理长范围依赖和处理长输入中部信息的问题，当前解决方案存在局限性。

Method: 提出了双阶段自适应锐化（DSAS），包括两个模块：上下文门控加权（CGW）和互惠注意力抑制（RAS），无需结构修改或额外参数训练即可使用。

Result: 经过四个基准测试，DSAS在主流大型语言模型上的表现提高了4.2%的F1得分。消融研究证实了CGW和RAS模块的关键作用，附录中的讨论进一步验证了DSAS的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DSAS是一个有效的解决方案，改善了大型语言模型在多文档问答任务中的表现，并且易于集成、无需额外的架构修改。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

Motivation: 当前的评估框架通常在理想条件下评估单轮问答，忽视了医疗咨询中的复杂性。

Method: 引入 MedQA-Followup 框架，通过对 MedQA 数据集的控制干预，系统地评估医学问答中的多轮稳健性。

Result: 虽然模型在浅层扰动下表现尚可，但在多轮情境中表现出严重的脆弱性，准确性从 91.2% 降至最低 13.5%。间接、基于上下文的干预往往比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮交互中的稳健性是安全和可靠部署医学大语言模型的一个关键但尚未充分探索的维度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT introduces a new Chinese encoder with improvements in tokenization, masking, and pre-training, achieving competitive performance and high throughput, and surpasses some models in specific tasks when additional data is used.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance Chinese encoder-only Transformers by addressing specific challenges like tokenization and morphology, which differ from English, to improve accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency for Chinese language models.

Method: The paper introduces Chinese ModernBERT using a 32k BPE vocabulary tailored for Chinese, whole-word masking with a dynamic curriculum, a two-stage pre-training pipeline with extended context, and a damped-cosine learning-rate schedule. Pre-training involved ~1.2T Chinese tokens from several datasets.

Result: Chinese ModernBERT shows competitive performance with strong Chinese encoders and achieves high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed. It surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding on SimCLUE in retrieval-oriented quality when using additional open contrastive data.

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT surpasses existing Chinese encoders in several aspects under certain conditions and offers a scaling path for semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks with additional curated data.

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型与人脑活动的对齐关系，尤其是大脑对齐和词预测的特征依赖差异，揭示NWP注重语法，而BA关注语义及篇章信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型和人类大脑活动之间的对齐，对于揭示语言处理的计算原则具有重要意义，并希望了解大脑对齐（BA）与下一个词预测（NWP）之间的关系。

Method: 引入一种细粒度输入归因方法，用于识别在大脑-LLM对齐中最重要的具体词语，该方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在各种语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Result: 发现大脑对齐（BA）和下一个词预测（NWP）依赖的词集大体不同：NWP表现出对最近和最初信息的偏好，尤其关注句法；而BA则优先考虑语义和篇章层级的信息，同时表现出更有针对性的最近效应。

Conclusion: 通过研究大语言模型（LLMs）和人类大脑活动之间的对齐，揭示两者在语言处理中的区别和联系，尤其是在语法、语义和篇章层面的不同特征依赖。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

*Yushu Zhao,Yubin Qin,Yang Wang,Xiaolong Yang,Huiming Han,Shaojun Wei,Yang Hu,Shouyi Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型展示出卓越性能，采用稀疏激活策略。当前的挑战在于CPU-GPU带宽限制，现有方法通过预取进行加速，但训练开销大且效果受限。本文提出了MoBiLE框架，通过大-小专家混合减少非重要token的专家数量并设计了回退及预取机制，实现了加速且准确性几乎不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的MoE模型推理效率受到CPU-GPU带宽限制的瓶颈，现有预取技术受训练开销和专家分割细化的影响，效果降低。为此提出一种新的框架以提升推理速度与效率。

Method: MoBiLE框架利用大-小专家组合，将不重要token的专家数量减少一半，同时重要token保持全部专家以确保质量。此外，设计了回退和预取机制以优化内存效率。

Result: 在四个现代MoE架构和富有挑战的生成任务上评估，MoBiLE在消费者级GPU系统中实现了1.60到1.72倍的加速，几乎无精度损失。

Conclusion: MoBiLE框架通过大-小专家混合策略和优化的内存管理机制显著提升了MoE模型的推理速度，并保持了模型的准确性，在消费者级GPU系统上获得了1.60倍到1.72倍的加速效果。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了超过200种语言的标记化效率，揭示了大规模语言模型中的计算不公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是量化大规模语言模型中的跨语言计算不公平性，助力开发更具包容性的多语言AI系统。

Method: 研究使用一致的预处理和归一化协议，并通过tiktoken库进行统一标记化，收集标记化统计数据，使用Tokens Per Sentence (TPS)和Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC)等评估指标进行分析。

Result: 拉丁文脚本语言在标记效率上表现更佳，而非拉丁文和形态复杂的语言面临更高的标记膨胀，RTC比率往往高出3-5倍。

Conclusion: 研究发现，非拉丁文以及形态复杂的语言在标记化过程中经历更高的标记膨胀，导致计算成本增加和上下文利用率降低。这体现出现有AI系统中的结构不平等性。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRoH 提出了一种动态规划和推理知识超图（KHs）的方法，克服了以往方法的三大限制，实验结果显示其在多个领域和任务上实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识超图的 RAG 方法存在静态检索规划、非自适应的检索执行，以及对知识超图结构和语义的肤浅使用，这些限制了其执行有效多跳问答的能力。为了克服这些限制，提出了 PRoH 框架。

Method: PRoH 结合了三个核心创新：(i) 一个上下文感知的规划模块来生成结构导向的推理计划；(ii) 结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演变的有向无环图（DAG）；(iii) 一个实体加权重叠（EWO）指导的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义上连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 实验表明 PRoH 在长程多跳推理任务中保持了强大的鲁棒性，并在多域上的表现超过了现有最高水平模型。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，PRoH 框架在多域任务上表现优异，达到和超越了之前的最高水平模型 HyperGraphRAG，F1 分数平均提高了 19.73%，生成评估分数提高了 8.41%。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决RAG系统不忠实性问题的框架CLEAR，通过隐藏状态探测和冲突感知微调，提高了系统的准确性和上下文忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统存在不忠实性问题，模型响应与检索到的上下文证据矛盾，而现有的方法多依赖外部干预并忽视LLM如何在知识冲突下内部整合检索证据与其参数记忆的问题。

Method: 我们提出CLEAR框架，该框架将上下文分解为细粒度的句子级知识，利用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识，并引入冲突感知微调以指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 通过三个基准的大量实验，CLEAR显著提高了RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实性，在多种冲突情况下持续优于强基线。

Conclusion: CLEAR框架能够显著提高RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实性，在多种冲突情况下表现优于强基线。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在形态泛化任务中能取得人类水平的准确率，但准确度受数据丰富性影响更大，更多反映的是人类语言能力的表面表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在语言形态学任务中的表现，特别是在涉及新词时的泛化能力，并比较其与人类语言能力的异同。

Method: 采用多语言版的Wug测试，对六种模型在四种不完全相关语言中进行测试，并将结果与人类进行比较。

Result: 研究结果显示这些模型能够以接近人类的准确度将形态学过程泛化到未见过的词中。然而，与语言结构复杂性相比，模型的准确度更与社区规模和数据可获得性相关，特别是西班牙语和英语这类有较大说话者社区及更丰富数字资源的语言表现出更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模型行为主要受语言资源丰富程度驱动，而非对语法复杂性的敏感度，其展现的性能只是表面上类似于人类的语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在文本生成能力上的增强，身份冒用的风险也随之增加。因此，作者研究了个性化机器生成文本（MGT）的检测问题，以应对这一风险。

Method: 作者提出了一种新方法\method，该方法通过识别对应于反转特征的潜在方向，并构建主要在这些特征上有所不同的探针数据集来评估检测器的依赖性。

Result: 实验结果显示，在个性化设置中，许多最先进的模型的性能显著下降，而\method能够准确预测检测器在个性化设置中的性能变化，表现出85%的相关性。

Conclusion: 在论文中，作者提出了一种名为\dataset的基准，用于评估在个性化设置下检测器的鲁棒性，并发现了一些检测器在个性化设置下性能的显著下降。他们同时提出了一种名为\method的方法，能够准确预测个性化设置中检测器性能变化的方向和幅度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 在推理时通过额外计算来改进大型语言模型（LLM）输出的需求推动了测试时间缩放方法的研究。

Method: 研究中使用了三种测试时间缩放方法：模型平均、少数服从多数和Best-of-N采样方法。其中，模型平均和少数服从多数在LeWiDi任务中一致地改进了LLM性能，而Best-of-N方法没有。

Result: 两种基准方法（模型平均和少数服从多数）在LeWiDi任务上显著改善了LLM的表现，而Best-of-N采样方法没有显示出同样的效果。

Conclusion: 实验表明，测试时间缩放方法可以在注释分歧任务中改善LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法在从数学任务转移到LeWiDi任务时效果不佳。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）在处理典型和异常实例时如何权衡其模型中的语用先验和语义先验问题。

Method: 引入新的评估数据集VISaGE，包括典型和例外的图像，用于研究VLMs在典型和异常实例上的表现。通过精心平衡的实验分析VLMs在处理不一致图像时的性能退化。

Result: 研究表明，当打破语用先验所基于的一致性假设时，VLMs的概念理解能力下降，并且这种效果在查询个别实例时较语义先验的影响更强。

Conclusion: 在异常实例的分析中，VLMs的语用先验对概念理解的影响大于语义先验，且新的数据集有助于更深入地理解这一现象。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型（LLMs）通常无法准确传达其不确定性，可能对相同问题产生不同答案，但产生的回答通常缺乏针对这种变化的调整。提出了一种名为Faithful Uncertainty Tuning（FUT）的微调方法，使得在不改变语言模型原有答案分布的情况下，模型能忠实表达不确定性。研究结果显示，FUT在保持开放域问答准确性的同时，显著减少了忠实度差距，且引入的语义分布偏移极小。

Motivation: 大型语言模型经常在重复查询时给出不同答案，且生成的回答通常未能反映这种不确定性的变化，导致传达出的信息不够忠实。本文的动机是解决这种忠实度差距的问题，使得强大的语言模型也能准确表达知识不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种新的微调策略Faithful Uncertainty Tuning（FUT），通过使用不确定性提示（如“可能”或“可能”）增强模型样本来构造训练数据，且不需要除模型和一组提示之外的任何监督。

Result: FUT方法显著减少了语言模型的忠实度差距，同时在开放域问答中保持了回答的准确性，且引入的语义分布偏移极小。进一步的分析证明了FUT在不同解码策略、选择的提示词以及其他不确定性表达形式（如数值表达）上的稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，Faithful Uncertainty Tuning（FUT）是一种简单且有效的方法，可以让大型语言模型忠实地传达不确定性，而不会影响问答准确性或引入显著的语义偏移。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Conclusion: StyleDecipher在多领域和跨领域的评估中表现优异，超越了现有基线，并提供了可解释的检测结果。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Motivation: The motivation behind this work is to improve academic translation quality and advance research in the academic domain and long-context translation by providing high-quality parallel datasets and fine-tuned models.

Method: Two large language models were fine-tuned on the ACAD-TRAIN dataset and evaluated against specialized machine-translation systems, open-weight LLMs, and other large-scale proprietary models using the ACAD-BENCH evaluation set.

Result: Fine-tuning on the ACAD-TRAIN dataset resulted in an average improvement of +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points for 7B and 2B models, respectively. Long-context translation in the general domain improved by up to 24.9% for translations out of English. The top-performing model surpassed the best proprietary and open-weight models in the academic translation domain.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned models on the ACAD-TRAIN dataset outperformed the current best proprietary and open-weight models in academic translation, proving the dataset's utility and value.

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation,
that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5
million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prompt engineering for Large Language Models, particularly for smaller and locally optimized models.

Method: Introduced COSTAR-A framework and conducted controlled prompt-output assessments on models with a maximum of 8 billion parameters to evaluate performance improvements.

Result: COSTAR-A improved output structure and decisiveness for smaller, fine-tuned models, with notable performance improvements observed in the Llama 3.1-8B model.

Conclusion: COSTAR-A framework demonstrates improved prompt clarity and effectiveness, particularly for smaller models and resource-constrained environments, though its improvement varies across different models and tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

*Chaoxu Pang,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过使用PARO框架，自动生成与推理任务模式对齐的注释，能够显著减少注释成本，同时保持性能，取代大规模人类注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于在patterned reasoning任务中，推理模式而非注释数量或质量是性能的关键决定因素，本文研究了在不降低推理性能的前提下降低注释成本的方法。

Method: 本文提出了Pattern-Aware LLMs作为Rationale AnnOtators（PARO）框架，通过使大语言模型生成与任务特定的推理模式对齐的注释，来替代人类的推理注释，并不需要大量的人工注释。

Result: 实验表明，PARO生成的注释能够在SFT+RLVR中实现与10倍规模的人类注释相当的性能，表明可以用LLM的自动注释替代大规模人类推理注释，而只需有限的人类监督。

Conclusion: 在patterned reasoning任务中，通过使用PARO框架，可以减少人类注释所需的成本和提高模型性能。LLM生成的注释与任务特定的推理模式对齐，并且与人类生成的注释相比，在SFT+RLVR性能上表现得相当。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

*Sunny Yu,Ahmad Jabbar,Robert Hawkins,Dan Jurafsky,Myra Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了“生成空间大小（GSS）”的概念，利用其来检测和校正LLM在不同任务中的输出偏差，实验表明GSS在改进输出多样性和质量方面是有效的。作者通过三个不同应用展示了GSS的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者指出，当前的大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成任务中常常失去校准，导致在创造性任务中输出过于同质化或在事实性任务中产生幻觉般的多样化错误响应。为此，他们引入了一个名为生成空间大小（GSS）的概念，以统一地解决这些失败模式。

Method: 本文提出并使用了一个名为GSSBench的任务套件，其中包含带有真实GSS关系的提示对，以评估不同度量标准并理解模型行为的偏差。此外，作者使用了一种称为EigenScore的幻觉检测度量标准，该标准利用模型内部信息进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，幻觉检测度量，特别是EigenScore，在检测模型输出偏差方面优于标准的多样性和不确定性量化度量。此外，研究展示了GSS在检测任务中不同应用的有效性，包括检测提示歧义、解释推理模型中的过度思考和不足思考以及引导模型扩展其生成空间。

Conclusion: 本文作者提出，生成空间大小（GSS）的概念可以用来统一和解决不同任务中LLM失灵的问题。研究表明，使用GSS可以检测模型在生成过程中的偏差，并通过调整GSS来改善输出的多样性和质量。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过采用广义范畴语法扩展人工语言形式，发现语言模型在处理类型上合理的词序时具有更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了研究语言模型是否存在偏向类型上常见语法特性的归纳偏置，进一步扩展了之前的研究。

Method: 我们采用广义范畴语法（GCG）扩展了上下文无关的人工语言形式化，评估更注重于语言模型处理未见过的长测试句子的泛化能力。

Result: 我们的人工语言更好地捕捉了自然语言的特征，实验表明语言模型在处理类型上合理的词序时具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 我们的实验范式得出了更清晰的结论：语言模型更容易对类型上合理的词序进行创造性概括。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估对话自然性的新方法DGRC，发现语言模型倾向于继续主要内容对话，指导调优增强了这种现象，相关提示可削弱此偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于对话自然性的概念多种多样且可扩展的定量指标有限，研究者希望通过语言学中的主要议题性来评估对话的自然性。

Method: 在这项研究中，提出了一种新的评估对话自然性的方法：分割、生成、重组和比较（DGRC）。具体而言，该方法分为四个步骤：（i）将对话分割作为一个提示，（ii）使用语言模型为子部分生成后续内容，（iii）将对话和生成的内容重组，并（iv）比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 应用DGRC方法，我们发现语言模型更倾向于继续讨论主要内容，当存在相关提示时，这种偏好会减弱。在指导调优的模型中，这种偏好效果更为显著。

Conclusion: 研究表明语言模型更倾向于继续涉及主要内容的对话，这种倾向在经过指导调优的模型中更加明显。此外，当出现相关提示词（例如“嘿，等一下”）时，模型会削弱其主要内容偏好。尽管指导调优并未进一步增强这种调节效果，但该模式反映了成功对话动态的一个标志。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Motivation: 当前对LLM的批评多基于索绪尔和乔姆斯基的理论框架，常显得投机和无效。作者希望通过引入曼查克的原则，以更具实证性的方法改进LLM的设计和评估。

Method: 本文采用曼查克的语言学框架，对此前的批评进行反驳，并提出构建和评估语言模型的指导方针。

Result: 通过新的视角，提供了新的LLM设计、评估和解读的指导，可以更好地理解和应用语言模型。

Conclusion: 本文呼吁从曼查克的经验主义角度重新审视LLM的语言建模能力，认为语言的使用频率是其首要原则。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

### [126] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor is a new ICU mortality prediction framework that integrates key clinical decision elements—clinical course, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness—into its reasoning, greatly improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ICU mortality prediction often lack interpretability and misalign with clinical decision-making practices, which require insights into clinical course, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness.

Method: ProtoDoctor features the Prognostic Clinical Course Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The former uses prototype learning and a novel regularization mechanism for prognostication awareness, while the latter employs cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments to model demographic heterogeneity.

Result: ProtoDoctor significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of predictive accuracy and offers more clinically relevant, trustworthy interpretations as validated by human evaluations.

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and offers clinically meaningful interpretations, enhancing trust and applicability in ICU practices.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型使用昂贵的在线强化学习或专家迭代，在固定问题集上训练效率低下，限制了模型处理复杂问题的能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种生成对抗强化学习（GAR）的RL训练框架，协同训练问题生成器和求解器，采用隐式课程学习机制。

Result: 在MiniF2F-Test基准上的pass@32平均相对提升4.20%，在ProofNet-Test上的pass@32从22.58%提升至25.81%。

Conclusion: GAR提高了训练效率并增强了高级定理的证明能力，同时在MiniF2F-Test和ProofNet-Test基准测试上表现出更好的证明性能。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Schrödinger桥问题在实施过程中常出现不稳定性，特别是在高维或数据稀缺的情况下，因此研究引入软约束以提高稳定性和灵活性。

Method: 采用了软约束Schrödinger桥问题，并通过Doob's h-transform表示、Schrödinger势的稳定性结果、Gamma收敛及新颖的固定点论证来进行分析。

Result: 实现了罚函数水平下最优解的存在性，并证明随着罚函数增大，控制和价值函数线性收敛到经典Schrödinger桥问题的解。

Conclusion: 研究证明了最优解的存在性，提供了软约束桥的量化收敛保证，并指出惩罚正则化如何支持生成建模及相关应用。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

Result: 该方法仅需使用之前方法的一小部分时间和内存，不仅计算效率高，而且在估计自我影响和列车-测试影响上，表现出优异的准确性，适用于大规模语言模型的分析。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的零次近似方法来估计训练数据的影响，其计算效率显著提高，并在自我影响及列车-测试影响的估计准确性上表现优异。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

TL;DR: Boundary Guidance improves generative model outputs by using reinforcement learning to avoid classifier decision boundaries, enhancing both safety and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the suboptimal results of generator fine-tuning strategies which lead models towards producing samples near the classifier's decision boundary, increasing false positives and negatives.

Method: A reinforcement learning fine-tuning method called Boundary Guidance, which directs generation away from the classifier's margin.

Result: Boundary Guidance outperforms traditional methods by enhancing generative model safety and utility on a benchmark of jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, as confirmed by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

Conclusion: Boundary Guidance effectively improves both the safety and utility of outputs from generative models by steering them away from the classifier's decision boundary.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff enhances synthetic time series generation by leveraging wavelet coefficients to capture multi-resolution structures, outperforming existing methods in various domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of large, high-quality time series datasets limits applications in various fields. Current models struggle to reproduce the multi-scaled structure of real-world time series.

Method: WaveletDiff uses diffusion models on wavelet coefficients, combining transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms and energy preservation constraints to maintain spectral fidelity.

Result: WaveletDiff shows superior performance across six real-world datasets in energy, finance, and neuroscience domains. It achieves significantly better discriminative and Context-FID scores than existing methods.

Conclusion: WaveletDiff, a novel framework, improves synthetic generation of multi-scaled time series by outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both time and frequency domains.

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在特定的重播比例配置和计算预算下，可以在特定任务表现与一般知识保留之间实现最佳平衡。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.

binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

TL;DR: 研究提出了整合显式负面陈述的知识图谱嵌入新方法，采用双模型架构提升预测性能，实验证明其优于当前技术水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数现有的图嵌入方法依赖于封闭世界假设或局部封闭世界假设，将缺失的三元组视为假，这与许多实际知识图谱所依据的开放世界假设不同。此外，显式负面陈述在嵌入训练中常被忽视，而这些陈述可以帮助区分错误和未知的三元组。

Result: 实验结果表明，新提出的方法在链路预测和三元组分类任务中提高了预测性能，优于现有最先进的嵌入模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的知识图谱嵌入学习方法，通过将显式声明的负面陈述整合到学习过程中，提高了预测性能。这种方法在通用和特定领域的知识图谱上进行了验证，结果显示相较于现有最先进的模型有显著改善。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Result: 本文研究了一种用于序列决策的变换器架构——保守对抗鲁棒决策转换器（CART），以增强决策转换器（DT）在对抗性随机游戏中的鲁棒性。通过将变换器策略置于由阶段游戏推导出的纳什Q值上，CART生成的策略对抗性鲁棒性更强，并且对状态转换的不确定性更为保守。从经验上来看，CART在各种对抗性随机游戏中能够更准确地估计极小极大值，并始终获得更优的最坏情况收益。

Conclusion: 保守对抗鲁棒决策转换器（CART）能够增强决策转换器在对抗性随机游戏中的鲁棒性，取得更优的最坏情况收益。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种避免过度参数化的双层优化框架AdaRL，在MuJoCo基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法常依赖于嵌套的极小极大优化，这种方法计算上昂贵并且导致过于保守的策略，因此需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种名为自适应秩表示（AdaRL）的双层优化框架。在下层，AdaRL在固定秩约束下进行策略优化，采用从距离中心模型的Wasserstein球中采样的动态进行，而在上层，自适应调整秩以平衡偏差-方差权衡，利用低秩流形投影策略参数。

Result: 该方法在MuJoCo连续控制基准测试上的实验证明，AdaRL不仅始终优于固定秩基线（例如SAC）和最先进的鲁棒RL方法（例如RNAC、Parseval），而且逐渐收敛于潜在任务的固有秩。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，自适应低秩策略表示对于在模型不确定性下进行鲁棒强化学习提供了一种高效且有原则的替代方案。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Method: 引入新的数据集，提出统一的形式化方法，进行实证分析以展示结合两类事件的模型优势。

Result: 实验证明结合个人和关系事件的模型更具优势，现有方法仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 向研究社区发布数据集和资源，推动统一用户事件建模的进一步研究。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Wi-Fi信号受环境动态、信道传播特性及硬件异质性影响，传统方法需人工校准且在条件变化时快速性能下降，研究者希望通过新方法改进室内定位。

Method: Locaris将每个接入点测量作为一个标记处理，通过在不同Wi-Fi数据集上的微调，学习从原始信号到设备位置的直接映射。并通过实验与现有最先进方法进行比较，证明Locaris的有效性。

Result: 实验显示Locaris不仅在各种遥测数据类型上匹配或超越现有技术，并且能在已知设备和不变场景下保持高精度，少样本适应实验中也显示出良好表现，仅需少量校准点即可获得次米级精度。

Conclusion: Locaris可以作为室内定位的无校准回归模型，具备可扩展性及鲁棒性，即使在Wi-Fi部署不均的情况下，也能够良好地跨环境定位。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Method: 提出三种新的重启方法：部分重启、自适应重启和选择性重启，并将其应用于现有的RestartQ-UCB和RANDOMIZEDQ算法。

Result: 在多个不同环境中实现了近乎最优的经验性能，相对于RestartQ-UCB减少了多达91%的动态遗憾。

Conclusion: 提出了三种有效的重启范式，可以改进现有的模型无关非平稳RL算法，从而提高动态表现。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习解缠结表征是机器学习中的重要目标，传统方法是使用变分自编码器（VAE），其通过KL散度惩罚来匹配因子化的高斯先验。然而，KL正则化不能可靠地实现目标分布。在此背景下，提出了一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 本文提出了以最大平均差异（MMD）为基础的程序化先验框架，允许直接塑造潜空间，达到独立且互不影响的状态。使用新的无监督指标：潜可预测性评分（LPS）来验证和量化缠结问题。

Result: 通过程序化先验框架，在复杂数据集上如CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet，实现了显著的潜空间独立性，不存在重构权衡，并改进了与语义特征的一致性。

Conclusion: 通过提出的程序化框架，实现了表征工程领域的进步，使得在复杂数据集上更好地实现潜空间独立性，并为模型的可识别性和因果推理打开了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

TL;DR: Y-shaped generative flows enhance model performance by capturing shared structures, thus improving metrics and efficiency over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this study is to address the limitation of modern continuous-time generative models that use V-shaped transport, which leads to independent and nearly straight sample trajectories, thereby missing shared structural insights. The authors aim to create a model that recognizes shared pathways of probability mass movement.

Method: The authors propose a new framework called Y-shaped generative flows, which is based on a novel transport cost that uses a velocity-powered sublinear exponent. This involves a scalable neural ODE training objective that encourages shared mass movement before branching to target-specific endpoints.

Result: Empirical results showed that Y-flows are capable of recovering hierarchy-aware structures and perform better than existing flow-based baselines in terms of distributional metrics, while also requiring fewer integration steps to reach their destination.

Conclusion: Y-shaped generative flows outperform traditional V-shaped models by capturing hierarchy-aware structures more effectively, improving distributional metrics, and reducing the number of integration steps needed to reach their target distributions.

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

Conclusion: MosaicDiff框架可以在不损害输出质量的情况下，显著加速扩散模型的采样过程，并提供了一种新的视角用于更高效和强健的无训练扩散加速。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Conclusion: 本文提出的QLENS方法为跨领域的见解提供了基础，以便在更广泛的范围内理解Transformer。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

Motivation: VLM模型的微调在应对偏好的过程中往往不稳定，错误的负样本会带来不必要的梯度影响，从而扰乱整个训练过程。

Method: 引入了一种新的优化方法，称为冷却加权的DPO，分为两个阶段。第一阶段通过温和的负样本进行监督微调，第二阶段则应用带有冷却权重的DPO目标避免不必要的梯度影响，同时保持对困难负样本的敏感。

Result: CW-DPO在多种VLM任务中表现出更稳定的优化、更好的校准和更高的配对胜率，同时在更少的步数内收敛。

Conclusion: 在冷却优先之前平滑学习动态是实现鲁棒VLM对齐的一个简单、通用的原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Conclusion: 本文提出的MEASURE框架在减少域相关信息的同时，保留了睡眠阶段分类所需的重要时间和频谱特征，并在基准数据集上的表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法需要领域特定的归纳偏置以结合数据拓扑结构，而这种偏置的设计需要很大努力且可能引入影响泛化的副作用。因此，引入了不需要域特定偏置且直接结合数据拓扑的Chimera模型。

Method: 引入了Chimera模型，该模型通过在有向无环图上实现线性时间递归以及对一般图使用简单的数学松弛，来改进Chimera的效率。

Result: Chimera在语言、视觉和图领域的表现强劲，超过了GLUE上的BERT、ImageNet-1k上的ViT以及所有Long Range Graph Benchmark基线。

Conclusion: Chimera通过在语言、视觉和图表领域的强劲表现验证了其核心贡献，证明数据拓扑可以作为跨模式的强大归纳偏置。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

Conclusion: nuGPR能有效减小GPR的训练时间和内存消耗，尤其是在处理较大规模的数据集时表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Conclusion: 该论文展示了一种针对联邦学习系统的故意公平性攻击，该攻击在模型的全球准确性保持下，显著增加了模型的偏差。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 将生成型变压器与判别性验证相结合，可以促进连锁推理，而无需扩大规模和使用自然语言。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Conclusion: 提出了一种轻量级的元重加权替代方法，通过均值中心化、行偏移和标签符号调制的集成，实现了更稳定的性能，同时避免了昂贵的双层优化。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Motivation: 扩散模型在高保真图像生成中表现出色，但由于其固有的迭代去噪过程导致采样缓慢。一些新方法通过学习直接的噪声到图像的映射来加速推理，但牺牲了扩散动态的可解释性和细粒度控制，这些是实现可编辑生成的关键优势。为了解决这一二难困境，我们引入了一种新框架。

Method: 我们的方法是基于库普曼算子理论，通过将非线性扩散动力学提升到一个由全球线性算子控制的潜在空间中，实现封闭形式的轨迹解决方案，从而消除迭代采样，并在生成过程中提供对中间状态的完全访问。

Result: 我们通过实验证明，分层库普曼扩散不仅实现了有竞争力的单步生成性能，而且还通过光谱分析为解释和操纵生成过程提供了一个有原则的机制。

Conclusion: 我们的框架弥合了扩散模型中快速采样和可解释性之间的差距，为生成建模中的可解释图像合成铺平了道路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Conclusion: IMDGA能够揭示并缓解Graph-LLMs在TAG表示学习中的关键弱点，并提供提高其弹性的见解。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

TL;DR: MoRA dynamically adapts LLMs to specific molecular inputs, improving performance on molecular tasks significantly over static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing multi-modal alignment methods that either optimize a shared parameter space or cause catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuning the LLM.

Method: Proposed Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA) which creates unique low-rank adaptation weights for each molecular input and integrates them into a frozen LLM.

Result: MoRA shows a 14.1% improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% error reduction in quantum property prediction compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation significantly outperforms static adaptation methods in key molecular tasks.

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 文章探讨了在表现学习中利用正则化应对模型对数据分布影响的复杂性，尤其是在过参数化的高维岭回归中，找到与表现效应强度相匹配的最佳正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要不仅优化当前数据的模型，还要考虑模型可能会将分布引导到一个新方向，为应对这一复杂动态，探讨正则化方法。

Method: 研究高维岭回归中的正则化在应对表现效应中的作用。通过实证评估了合成和真实数据集上的最优正则化参数。

Result: 虽然在总体设置下表现效应会恶化测试风险，但在特征数量超过样本数量的过参数化情况下，这种效应可能是有益的。

Conclusion: 最佳正则化随表现效应的总体强度而变化，可以预先针对这一效应设置正则化，引导更有效的模型训练方案。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively
maintaining a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ChangfuXu/D4RL-FTD) for
papers and other related resources to apply DMs for RL.

TL;DR: FedMMKT framework enhances server T2I and client-specific models using decentralized multimodal data without sacrificing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adaptation of T2I models to specialized tasks is constrained by the scarcity of task-specific data due to privacy concerns, creating a need for methods that can leverage decentralized multimodal data without compromising privacy.

Method: The paper introduces a framework called Federated Multi-modal Knowledge Transfer (FedMMKT) which utilizes decentralized multimodal data for model improvement.

Conclusion: FedMMKT framework successfully enables the co-enhancement of server T2I models and client task-specific models using decentralized multimodal data, all while preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated their versatility in a wide
range of applications. However, adaptation of T2I models to specialized tasks
is often limited by the availability of task-specific data due to privacy
concerns. On the other hand, harnessing the power of rich multimodal data from
modern mobile systems and IoT infrastructures presents a great opportunity.

*Ziyi Han,Huanyu Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Xiangxiang Dai,Xutong Liu,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA是一种无需训练的框架，通过自适应选择和激活LoRA的部分参数，显著提升了领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖于明确的任务标签或额外训练，这在实际应用中不够实用。此外，这些方法通常激活固定数量的完整LoRA模块，导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能。因此需要一种创新方法来优化LoRA模块的使用。

Method: 提出了一个训练无关的框架，即HiLoRA，它利用LoRA的结构特性进行自适应层次路由选择。在输入序列级别，根据高斯似然选择LoRA子集并进行ROC分配；在token级别，仅激活最具信息的ROC以优化路由。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，与最先进的基线方法相比，HiLoRA在领域泛化方面的准确率提高了至多55%，同时保持了可比的推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种训练无关的HiLoRA框架，通过自适应层次路由对LoRA池进行优化，显著提高了领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

TL;DR: GFF-PIELM方法大幅提高了解决高频和变频PDE问题的准确性，同时保持了PIELM的高效性和简单性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规的PIELM在解决涉及高频和变频行为的偏微分方程（PDE）时面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种通用的傅里叶特征物理信息极限学习机（GFF-PIELM），通过将傅里叶特征映射（FFM）的变体作为激活函数融入到ELM中，并为隐藏神经元分配频率系数，开发了一种创新的初始化方法。

Result: 通过五个案例研究，证明了GFF-PIELM在处理高频、变频、多尺度行为、不规则边界和反问题中的可行性和有效性，显著提高了预测精度。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM方法成功解决了传统PIELM在高频和变频PDE问题中的挑战，提高了预测精度而不增加训练时间和架构复杂性。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合世界模型和表示学习，研究安全策略改进在在线环境中的应用，扩展其理论控制到更复杂的场景。

Method: 开发理论框架，利用世界模型和表示学习，将策略更新限制在良好定义的邻域内，同时引入DeepSPI算法，将局部转移和回报损失与正则化策略更新结合。

Result: 引入了一种名为DeepSPI的新算法，在ALE-57基准测试中表现优异，超过了如PPO和DeepMDPs等强基线，并且保留了理论保证。

Conclusion: 通过理论框架证明，限制策略更新在当前策略的良好定义邻域内，能够实现单调性改进和收敛。这一结论通过DeepSPI算法得到验证，其在在线测试中表现良好。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提供了单时间尺度的策略-评论家算法在变化奖励函数下的收敛性分析，证明在标准假设下可达到O(1/√T)收敛率，解决了许多流行强化学习技术的理论基础问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多流行的实际强化学习算法通过奖励塑造、熵正则化或课程学习等技巧使用了不断演变的奖励函数，但其理论基础尚未完善。该研究旨在弥补这一缺陷，提供相关的理论分析。

Method: 该研究采用了一种单时间尺度的策略-评论家算法，并在马尔可夫采样的情况下进行了分析。通过在每个时间步骤中改变奖励参数，研究解析了对策略优化和价值评估的影响，并推导出非渐近性界限。

Result: 在标准假设下，我们得出策略和评论家误差的非渐近性界限。研究结果表明，当奖励参数变化足够缓慢时，可以达到O(1/√T)的收敛率，且若奖励参数通过具有界限梯度的梯度规则更新，并且与策略与评论家在同一时间尺度上，则该收敛率依然能保持。第二贡献是引入了一种在马尔可夫采样下的分布不匹配的全新分析，在静态奖励情况下将最佳已知率改善了一个$\log^2T$因子。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提供了单时间尺度策略-评论家算法在具有变化奖励函数和马尔可夫采样的情况下的有限时间收敛性分析。研究结果表明，当奖励参数的变化足够缓慢时，可以达到与静态奖励相同的O(1/√T)收敛率。这为许多流行的强化学习技术提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve encrypted text generation for LLMs, enhancing coherence and privacy through a novel TSP-based token reordering strategy and complementary post-processing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure and encrypted communication is crucial when users interact with large language models using private information. Current methods face challenges particularly in the area of text generation, such as next-token prediction under homomorphic encryption.

Method: We propose a TSP-based token reordering strategy and a complementary post-processing step to tackle encrypted text generation for LLMs.

Result: Theoretical and experimental analysis show that the new method enhances encrypted text generation by improving coherence and maintaining data privacy.

Conclusion: Our proposed TSP-based token reordering strategy combined with a post-processing step improves encrypted text generation by preventing collapse, enhancing coherence, and ensuring data privacy.

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统错误检测和更正方法主要集中于单一模态，未能有效处理跨模态错误，尤其是在电商和医疗健康领域，图像、表格和文本数据共存的情况下。

Method: 在四个数据集和五个基准方法上进行评估，探索不同方法的表现。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope结合强大的AutoML框架时表现最佳，获得最高的F1分数。

Conclusion: 用于跨模态搜索错误的方法目前仍然存在局限性，尤其是在处理实际数据时，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Motivation: 现有多数方法仅适用于同质图，未考虑语义不匹配问题，而现实世界的图大多是异构的。本研究旨在解决这一问题，并减少对标记数据的依赖。

Method: 首先设计了一种结构感知的预训练任务，以捕获异构图中的结构特性；接着设计了一种语义感知的预训练任务来解决语义不匹配问题，具体来说，构建一个由语义邻居组成的扰动子空间，以帮助处理语义不匹配。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种高效的框架，用于在大型异构图上预训练GNNs，实验表明该方法相对于最新的基线方法具有优越性。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Motivation: 通过CWD在达到稳态流形时引入滑模行为，寻找未修改目标的局部帕累托最优的稳态点。

Method: 引入了一种名为Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 的方法，这是一种与优化器无关的修改，仅将权重衰减应用于参数坐标与优化器更新符号一致的情况下。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类中，CWD在处理百万到十亿级参数规模时，一致性地改进了最终损失和准确性。

Conclusion: CWD改进了语言模型预训练和ImageNet分类任务的最终损失和准确性。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了使用两个连续距离函数来评估生成模型的独特性和新奇性，提供了一种更加可靠的评估基础，比传统的距离函数能够揭示更多的洞见。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于高斯过程和贝叶斯优化的非参数定价方法，提高了收益表现且假设较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态定价用于通过调整产品的销售价格来最大化公司的收入，挑战在于需求函数未知，需要从数据中学习。传统方法假设需求函数的参数形式来使用强化学习识别定价策略，但这些假设可能不适用于真实世界。

Method: 采用高斯过程作为需求函数，用贝叶斯优化开发定价算法，并为无限和有限库存设置提供遗憾保证，进行了广泛实验验证。

Result: 提出了一种基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，避免了限制性模型假设。通过贝叶斯优化开发了适用于无限和有限库存设置的定价算法，并为两种方案提供了遗憾保证，通过实验展示了方法在收益上优于现有强化学习算法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是一种在复杂不确定环境中进行动态定价的强大实用工具，可在提升收益的同时减少假设并提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 研究表明，锐度应被视为一个函数相关的特性，正则化可能导致更锋利的极小值，反而能改善模型的泛化和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视模型性能中锐度的重要性，提出应将锐度理解为一个与函数有关的特性，而非仅仅作为泛化能力差的标志。

Method: 进行从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务的广泛实证研究，研究模型在经过正则化（如使用SAM、权重衰减或数据增强）时，出现的较锋利的极小值点和模型表现之间的关系。

Result: 研究显示，经过正则化的模型往往会收敛到较锋利的极小值，这些极小值可以与更好的泛化能力、校准能力、鲁棒性和功能一致性共存。而没有正则化的基线模型通常收敛到较平坦的极小值，但在各项安全指标上表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明，函数复杂度而非单纯的平坦度决定了解的几何结构，正则化下的锋利极小值反映了更适合的问题的归纳偏差。这需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评价。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

*Viacheslav Vasilev,Arseny Ivanov,Nikita Gushchin,Maria Kovaleva,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TCVBM在视频生成和操控任务中改进了时间相关性处理，表现优于经典方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在复杂分布间的转换任务中表现有限，特别是在时间相关的数据序列（如视频生成和处理）中存在不足，因此需要改进的方法。

Method: 引入了一种名为TCVBM的视频桥接匹配方法，该方法扩展了桥接匹配模型，以适用于视频领域的时间相关性数据序列。

Result: TCVBM在多个定量指标上表现出色，展示了更高的生成质量和重建准确性。

Conclusion: TCVBM提供了一种有效的方法，在视频生成任务中比传统的桥接匹配和扩散模型更好地处理时间相关性。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD improves time series anomaly detection by modeling cross-scale and cross-window dynamics, showing superior performance compared to current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing time series anomaly detection methods struggle with modeling multi-scale information independently and fail to consider dynamic changes in cross-scale associations during anomalies. They also lack comprehensive contextual understanding due to reliance on fixed window sizes. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the CrossAD framework.

Method: The paper introduces a novel framework named CrossAD, which emphasizes cross-scale reconstruction to rebuild fine-grained series from coarser ones, and the use of a query library enabling global multi-scale context integration for time series anomaly detection.

Result: CrossAD exhibits state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection, as evidenced by extensive experiments across various datasets and using nine evaluation metrics. It outperforms current methods by effectively leveraging cross-scale associations and comprehensive context modeling.

Conclusion: CrossAD framework significantly improves the detection of anomalies in time series data by modeling cross-scale associations and integrating global multi-scale context, surpassing existing methods in accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出了PubSub-VFL，一种高效的垂直联邦学习范式，通过新的架构设计和优化问题解决方案，提高训练速度和资源利用率，并确保隐私和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字经济快速发展的背景下，组织之间数据协作成为一种商业模式，但隐私问题使得直接数据共享不可行，因此需要一种有效且安全的数据协作学习解决方案，而现有的VFL架构存在计算资源利用率低和训练效率低的问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的VFL范式PubSub-VFL，采用Publisher/Subscriber架构和参数服务器架构的数据并行性，设计了一种分层异步机制以降低训练延迟，改进系统效率。同时，正式化了一个优化问题，基于参与者的系统配置文件选择最优超参数。并进行了理论分析以证明其稳定的收敛性。

Result: PubSub-VFL在五个基准数据集上进行的大量案例研究显示，与最先进的基线相比，PubSub-VFL能在不损失训练准确性的情况下，将训练速度提高2到7倍，同时实现高达91.07%的计算资源利用率。

Conclusion: 实验验证了PubSub-VFL在提高训练速度和资源利用率方面的有效性，同时确保不损失训练准确性，并与差分隐私等安全协议兼容。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪生成模型在采样过程中存在预定义噪声水平与实际噪声水平不匹配的问题，即噪声偏移，导致生成质量下降。因此需提出改进措施以解决这一问题。

Method: 引入噪声感知引导（NAG）方法，通过显性引导采样轨迹使其与预定义噪声计划保持一致。此外，提出了无分类器版本的NAG，通过噪声条件丢弃联合训练噪声条件模型和噪声无条件模型，去除对外部分类器的依赖。

Conclusion: 噪声偏移问题在现代扩散模型中普遍存在，并对生成质量有负面影响。噪声感知引导（NAG）方法通过校正采样轨迹中的噪声偏移，提高了模型的生成能力，尤其在ImageNet生成和各种有监督微调任务中均表现出显著效果。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Conclusion: 区分可微因果发现方法通常在常用的具有挑战性的场景下表现出鲁棒性，尽管在尺度变化的情况下存在例外。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 成功设计和分析了两类算法，各自优先考虑性能或者强制满足约束，证明了结果的时间依赖性是全局最优的，并揭示了以前方法的一些局限性。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Motivation: 量化从功能角度看待知识蒸馏的压缩能力，并与结构缩减分离，以提高对知识蒸馏的理解。

Method: 使用假设检验、对照组和随机对照蒸馏，研究知识在不同数据模态中的转移机制，并探讨蒸馏的扩展规律。

Result: 在12种实验设置、9种架构和7个数据集上的研究结果表明，知识蒸馏更像是一种与数据相关的正则手段，而不是压缩机制。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏在不同数据模态和架构下的知识转移效果不如预期显著。此外，在发生重要知识转移的情况下，学生模型会不对称地接收负向知识，这对应用带来了安全隐患。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 通过分离粗粒化变量的发现和动力方程的拟合问题，使用基础推理模型提供了一种方法，可以有效简化和加速动态过程的粗粒化处理。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Conclusion: 实验证明，SG-XDEAT在多个公开基准上实现了比强基线更一致的增益，证实了同时建模原始视图和目标感知视图并自适应过滤噪声可以产生更加稳健的深度表格学习器。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Result: 在Common Voice 11.0印地语数据集上，不降低WER的情况下，Whisper-small参数减少35.4%，内存消耗降低14.25%，FLOPs减少18.5%；Whisper-medium参数减少31%，内存消耗降低15.29%，FLOPs减少16.95%。同时，较现有的迭代幅度剪枝方法多剪枝18.7%的参数，并使WER再降低12.31。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新框架，通过实施结构稀疏性和自定义文本归一化来优化Whisper模型，在不降低WER的情况下减少模型参数、内存消耗和FLOPs。

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on
Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art
Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along
with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

Conclusion: DiffEM方法能够有效地从受损数据中学习扩散模型，其迭代过程在适当的统计条件下具有单调收敛性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: 论文证明在某些条件下，均匀边采样能够保留用于集群的光谱子空间，从而无需复杂的采样方法也可以实现结构保留的光谱聚类。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

TL;DR: CALM is a lightweight inference-time technique that mitigates harmful outputs in large language models by altering their latent representations, outperforming existing methods without needing extra training or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails of language models, which can lead to harmful outputs.

Method: CALM works by modifying the latent representations in the last layer of the model through the Concept Weighting (CW) technique and orthogonal projection to remove harmful directions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CALM is successful in reducing harmful outputs and performs better than baseline methods across several metrics.

Conclusion: CALM provides an effective method to reduce harmful outputs from large language models without requiring additional training or model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent
representations of the last layer of the model, without retraining. Leveraging
\gls*{cw} technique from Computer Vision combined with orthogonal projection,
CALM removes unwanted latent directions associated with harmful content while
preserving model performance. Experiments show that CALM reduces harmful
outputs and outperforms baseline methods in most metrics, offering a
lightweight approach to AI safety with no additional training data or model
fine-tuning, while incurring only a small computational overhead at inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRA框架通过整合多模态的外生协变量，提高了TSFMs的预测质量，避免了灾难性遗忘，且在实验中表现出明显优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）受到大规模多元数据集的异质性和主干可扩展性的限制，通常预训练在单变量时间序列上，这导致它们无法充分利用真实世界预测任务中多样的协变量信息。

Method: CoRA框架通过保持基础模型的初始化和参数一致性，并采用一种新颖的格兰杰因果嵌入（GCE）方法，自动评估外生变量对目标变量的因果预测能力。这些嵌入与零初始化的条件注入机制结合，逐渐整合外生信息，避免了预训练基础模型的灾难性遗忘。

Result: CoRA方法在协变量感知预测任务上超过了最先进的协变量感知深度预测模型，实现31.1%的均方误差（MSE）减少。

Conclusion: CoRA方法提升了TSFMs在具有外生变量的预测任务上的性能，与多种先进的TSFM模型兼容，在多模态外生变量的情况下表现出更强的兼容性和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

TL;DR: 该文提出了一种名为CARVQ 的方法，通过压缩嵌入层降低大型语言模型的内存占用，从而提高其在边缘设备上的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在边缘设备上的存储需求大，压缩嵌入层可释放内存带宽并加速推理，CARVQ是一种后训练校正适配器结合量化方法，旨在解决该问题。

Method: CARVQ结合线性和非线性映射组成，并模拟原始模型嵌入，压缩至约1.6位，同时无需专业硬件支持。

Result: 该论文介绍了一种名为CARVQ的新型后训练校正适配器结合组残差向量量化方法，用以在边缘设备上有效部署大型语言模型。通过压缩嵌入层，该方法降低了模型的平均每参数位宽，同时保持了适当的模型困惑度和准确性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，CARVQ在大多数情况下可以在保持合理困惑度和准确性的同时，实现比标量量化更低的平均每参数位宽。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Result: 通过进行一定次数的一种操作以减少分类错误数。这些操作的问题在一般情况下是NP完全的。

Conclusion: 问题仍然在一些情况下是困难的，但在特定条件下可以通过固定参数解决。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

Motivation: 变量重要性估计常用于假设生成、特征选择和科学验证，但其准确性容易受到所使用模型和数据集中变量选择的影响，尤其是缺失重要变量的情况下。

Method: UNIVERSE方法通过使用Rashomon集合，即数据集中近似最优模型的集合，来给出真实变量重要性的界限。

Result: 在半合成模拟和信用风险任务中，UNIVERSE方法显示了强大的表现和实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE方法能够在特征缺失的情况下，为变量重要性提供理论保证的稳健估计。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

Conclusion: 通过利用适当损失集合的结构元素，改善了现有的方法，设计了一种直接且未随机化的算法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

TL;DR: M3ST-DTI is a novel model that integrates multi-modal features using advanced mechanisms to improve the prediction of drug-target interactions, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting DTI struggle with effectively capturing intra-modal feature interactions and cross-modal alignment. This limitation hinders their predictive performance and generalization ability.

Method: M3ST-DTI employs multi-task learning and integrates multi-modal features using self-attention mechanisms, hybrid pooling graph attention, and modules like MCA and BCA to enhance feature representations and alignments.

Result: M3ST-DTI shows improved performance over existing methods in DTI prediction as evidenced by extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: M3ST-DTI surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in predicting drug-target interactions across various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal in drug
discovery. However, existing approaches often fail to capture deep intra-modal
feature interactions or achieve effective cross-modal alignment, limiting
predictive performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose M3ST-DTI, a multi-task learning model that enables multi-stage
integration and alignment of multi modal features for DTI prediction. M3ST-DTI
incorporates three types of features-textual, structural, and functional and
enhances intra-modal representations using self-attention mechanisms and a
hybrid pooling graph attention module. For early-stage feature alignment and
fusion, the model in tegrates MCA with Gram loss as a structural constraint. In
the later stage, a BCA module captures fine-grained interactions between drugs
and targets within each modality, while a deep orthogonal fusion module
mitigates feature redundancy.Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M3ST-DTI consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods
across diverse metrics

Abstract: Grounding conversations in existing passages, known as Retrieval-Augmented

Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure they are faithful and don't provide
misinformation. Several benchmarks have been created to measure the performance
of LLMs on this task. We present a longitudinal study comparing the feedback
loop of an internal and external human annotator group for the complex
annotation task of creating multi-turn RAG conversations for evaluating LLMs.
We analyze the conversations produced by both groups and provide results of a
survey comparing their experiences. Our study highlights the advantages of each
annotator population and the impact of the different feedback loops; a closer
loop creates higher quality conversations with a decrease in quantity and
diversity. Further, we present guidance for how to best utilize two different
population groups when performing annotation tasks, particularly when the task

Abstract: Overplotted line charts can obscure trends in temporal data and hinder
prediction. We conduct a user study comparing three alternatives-aggregated,
trellis, and spiral line charts against standard line charts on tasks involving
trend identification, making predictions, and decision-making. We found
aggregated charts performed similarly to standard charts and support more
accurate trend recognition and prediction; trellis and spiral charts generally
lag. We also examined the impact on decision-making via a trust game. The
results showed similar trust in standard and aggregated charts, varied trust in
spiral charts, and a lean toward distrust in trellis charts. These findings
provide guidance for practitioners choosing visualization strategies for dense

Abstract: Line charts surface many features in time series data, from trends to
periodicity to peaks and valleys. However, not every potentially important
feature in the data may correspond to a visual feature which readers can detect
or prioritize. In this study, we conducted a visual stenography task, where
participants re-drew line charts to solicit information about the visual
features they believed to be important. We systematically varied noise levels
(SNR ~5-30 dB) across line charts to observe how visual clutter influences
which features people prioritize in their sketches. We identified three key
strategies that correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the
Replicator attempted to retain all major features of the line chart including
noise; the Trend Keeper prioritized trends disregarding periodicity and peaks;
and the De-noiser filtered out noise while preserving other features. Further,
we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and
valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were
represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than
accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and
human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering
time series data.

Abstract: While bodies change over time and trends vary, most store-bought clothing
comes in fixed sizes and styles and fails to adapt to these changes.
Alterations can enable small changes to otherwise static garments, but these
changes often require sewing and are non-reversible. We propose a modular
approach to garment design that considers resizing, restyling, and reuse
earlier in the design process. Our contributions include a compact set of
modules and connectors that form the building blocks of modular garments, a
method to decompose a garment into modules via integer linear programming, and
a digital design tool that supports modular garment design and simulation. Our
user evaluation suggests that our approach to modular design can support the
creation of a wide range of garments and can help users transform them across
sizes and styles while reusing the same building blocks.

*Sam Yu-Te Lee,Jingya Chen,Albert Calzaretto,Richard Lee,Alice Ferng,Mihaela Vorvoreanu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizCopilot原型利用可视化技术帮助企业聊天机器人更好地对齐用户意图，从而提高信息检索的相关性，但在细读与AI摘要信任方面仍需提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业聊天机器人在通过从大型异构数据库中检索上下文信息以生成答案时，常常给出"无关紧要的正确"回复，这提示需要改进对齐用户意图的能力。

Method: 通过Research-through-Design的研究方法，利用VizCopilot原型进行设计探讨，结合主题建模与文档可视化技术，使人类可以监督及调整检索到的上下文。

Result: 研究表明，尽管可视化有助于上下文对齐，当前系统在细读与信任AI摘要方面的验证支持仍有不足。

Conclusion: 可视化技术在上下文对齐中能帮助用户检测和纠正不对齐的问题，并促使用户调整询问策略，以便从一开始就检索到更相关的上下文。

Abstract: Enterprise chatbots show promise in supporting knowledge workers in
information synthesis tasks by retrieving context from large, heterogeneous
databases before generating answers. However, when the retrieved context
misaligns with user intentions, the chatbot often produces "irrelevantly right"
responses that provide little value. In this work, we introduce VizCopilot, a
prototype that incorporates visualization techniques to actively involve
end-users in context alignment. By combining topic modeling with document
visualization, VizCopilot enables human oversight and modification of retrieved
context while keeping cognitive overhead manageable. We used VizCopilot as a
design probe in a Research-through-Design study to evaluate the role of
visualization in context alignment and to surface future design opportunities.
Our findings show that visualization not only helps users detect and correct
misaligned context but also encourages them to adapt their prompting
strategies, enabling the system to retrieve more relevant context from the
outset. At the same time, the study reveals limitations in verification support
regarding close-reading and trust in AI summaries. We outline future directions
for visualization-enhanced chatbots, focusing on personalization, proactivity,
and sustainable human-AI collaboration.

*Skyler Oakeson,David H. Smith IV,Jaxton Winder,Seth Poulsen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文介绍了如何通过可选块扩展块排序问题，允许多种解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使块排序问题更具挑战性和灵活性，帮助学生掌握更复杂的问题解决技巧。

Method: 使用多图结构表示多重互斥依赖块并将其转化为 DAG，从而使用现有算法进行分级。

Result: 本文通过引入可选块扩展了块排序问题（如 Parsons 问题和证明块）的功能。提供实现可选块特性的算法，并展示将其整合到课程中的使用经验。可选块特性允许构建多种正确解决方案的 Parsons 问题，利用省略或可选块。通过多图结构表示多重互斥依赖块，然后折叠为有向无环图（DAG），从而复用现有算法进行分级。展示此特性在多个领域的潜在应用，包括帮助学生学习 Git 工作流、Shell 命令序列、数学证明和 Python 编程概念。

Conclusion: 可选块的引入能够使块排序问题更复杂，对学生有更多学习益处。

Abstract: This paper extends the functionality of block ordering problems (such as
Parsons problems and Proof Blocks) to include optional blocks. We detail the
algorithms used to implement the optional block feature and present usage
experiences from instructors who have integrated it into their curriculum. The
optional blocks feature enables instructors to create more complex Parsons
problems with multiple correct solutions utilizing omitted or optional blocks.
This affords students a method to engage with questions that have several valid
solutions composed of different answer components. Instructors can specify
blocks with multiple mutually exclusive dependencies, which we represent using
a multigraph structure. This multigraph is then collapsed into multiple
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), allowing us to reuse existing algorithms for
grading block ordering problems represented as a DAG. We present potential use
cases for this feature across various domains, including helping students learn
Git workflows, shell command sequences, mathematical proofs, and Python
programming concepts.

*Anna Fang,Jiayang Shi,Hriday Chhabria,Bosi Li,Haiyi Zhu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究比较了真实环境模拟的AR干预与非背景控制，发现真实情境能更有效促进心理健康技能向现实的迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VR/AR在心理健康领域备受关注，但之前的研究大多集中在宁静或抽象的环境中，缺乏对现实社会模拟如何更好地支持技能转移和应用于现实环境的研究。

Method: 进行了一项为期14天、涉及43名参与者的用户研究，将模拟真实环境的增强现实干预与非背景控制进行了对比。

Result: 在真实环境中练习心理健康技能的参与者在采用自我护理技术方面表现出更高的可能性，并在模拟现场任务中显示出较大的生理应激减少。

Conclusion: 本文提供了现实压力模拟效果的实证证据，并提出了关于支持心理健康技能向现实世界有效转移的技术设计意义。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) for mental
well-being, prior work using immersive interventions to teach mental health
skills has largely focused on calming or abstract settings. As a result, little
is known about how realistic social simulation may better support the transfer
and application of skills to in-person environments. In this work, we present a
14-day user study with 43-participants comparing an augmented reality
intervention simulating a realistic contextual environment against a matched
non-contextual control, applied to the public speaking context. We found that
participants who practice mental health skills in the contextual environment
showed significantly greater likelihood to apply self-care techniques and
greater physiological stress reduction when using skills in mock in-person
tasks. Overall, our work provides empirical evidence for the effects of
realistic stressor simulation, and offers design implications for mental health
technology that supports effective transfer of skills to the real-world.

*Sangho Suh,Rahul Hingorani,Bryan Wang,Tovi Grossman*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究推出了能适应用户问题的生成时间线系统KnowledgeTrail，并验证了其促进探索和知识构建的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的时间线工具大多静态，限制了用户的主动性和好奇心。有鉴于此，研究旨在引入一种生成时间线的概念，以增强时间线工具的动态性和用户交互能力。

Method: 通过实现一个名为KnowledgeTrail的系统并进行两项用户研究来验证生成时间线的概念。

Result: 介绍了一种名为KnowledgeTrail的生成时间线系统，该系统能够动态适应用户的问题，通过扩展或收缩时间线内容来帮助用户探索和构建知识。两个用户研究表明，该系统可以促进用户的好奇心驱动探索，偶然发现，以及追踪想法和事件之间复杂关系的能力。同时，引用功能支持验证，但也揭示了由来源可信度感知而导致的信任脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，KnowledgeTrail能够有效促进用户的探索欲和知识构建过程，并在设计探索界面时提供了有关平衡偶然性和可信度的见解。

Abstract: The landscape of interactive systems is shifting toward dynamic, generative
experiences that empower users to explore and construct knowledge in real time.
Yet, timelines -- a fundamental tool for representing historical and conceptual
development -- remain largely static, limiting user agency and curiosity. We
introduce the concept of a generative timeline: an AI-powered timeline that
adapts to users' evolving questions by expanding or contracting in response to
input. We instantiate this concept through KnowledgeTrail, a system that
enables users to co-construct timelines of historical events and knowledge
formation processes. Two user studies showed that KnowledgeTrail fosters
curiosity-driven exploration, serendipitous discovery, and the ability to trace
complex relationships between ideas and events, while citation features
supported verification yet revealed fragile trust shaped by perceptions of
source credibility. We contribute a vision for generative timelines as a new
class of exploratory interface, along with design insights for balancing
serendipity and credibility.

*Muhammad Talha,Abdullah Mohiuddin,Sehrish Javed,Ahmed Jawad Qureshi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现AR-CAD对初学者更友好，而传统CAD对有经验用户更适用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨增强现实技术在设计软件中的应用及其对不同技能水平设计者的影响。

Method: 通过让20名不同技能水平的参与者使用两个系统执行3D建模任务，比较了两者在任务完成时间、完成率和认知负荷方面的表现。

Result: 研究比较了基于增强现实的计算机辅助设计(AR-CAD)系统和传统计算机辅助设计(CAD)建模软件SolidWorks之间的用户体验。对比了两组用户在使用两个系统执行3D建模任务时的表现，发现两者的平均任务完成时间相当，但初学者在AR-CAD中有更高的完成率，而有经验的设计者在两种系统中的完成率相近。统计比较表明，AR-CAD略微减少了认知负荷，同时提高了任务完成率。初学者的系统可用性量表(SUS)得分较高，表明AR-CAD在降低CAD入门障碍方面更优越。

Conclusion: AR-CAD可以作为一种快速概念开发和教育工具，而传统CAD适合需要高级功能的用户。这表明增强现实界面在设计实践中具有提高体验的潜力。

Abstract: The paper presents a comparative user study between an Augmented
Reality-based Computer-Aided Design (AR-CAD) system and a traditional
computer-based CAD modeling software, SolidWorks. Twenty participants of
varying skill levels performed 3D modeling tasks using both systems. The
results showed that while the average task completion time is comparable for
both groups, novice designers had a higher completion rate in AR-CAD than in
the traditional CAD interface, and experienced designers had a similar
completion rate in both systems. A statistical comparison of task completion
rate, time, and NASA Task Load Index (TLX) showed that AR-CAD slightly reduced
cognitive load while favoring a high task completion rate. Higher scores on the
System Usability Scale (SUS) by novices indicated that AR-CAD was superior and
worthwhile for reducing barriers to entering CAD. In contrast, the Traditional
CAD interface was favored by experienced users for its advanced capabilities,
while many viewed AR-CAD as a valid means for rapid concept development,
education, and an initial critique of designs. This opens up the need for
future research on the needed refinement of AR-CAD with a focus on
high-precision input tools and its evaluation of complex design processes. This
research highlights the potential for immersive interfaces to enhance design
practice, bridging the gap between novice and experienced CAD users.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文研究了在沉浸式分析中，通过语音接口与数据交互时，用户如何通过体现性影响其意图的表达。通过对15名参与者的研究，识别出5种语音输入模式，提出了设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对在沉浸式环境中用于视觉分析的自然语言交互（NLI）越来越感兴趣，但用户的语音模式及其中体现性线索的使用尚未得到充分探索。理解用户意图与沉浸式分析系统之间的差异显得尤为重要。

Method: 使用巫术师(Wizard of Oz)方法进行用户研究，从734个话语中提取1280个语音行为，进行轴向编码，并通过语义熵测量分析任务的语音输入不确定性。

Result: 通过分析，识别出5种用户的语音输入模式，揭示用户在不同的分析任务阶段及对体现性依赖程度下，会动态使用体现性与非体现性的语音行为。这些模式与用户在研究中反映出的话语互动挑战因素一致，并据此提出了5种设计建议。

Conclusion: 研究发现用户根据数据分析任务的不同，会动态结合体现性和非体现性语音行为，并识别出5种语音输入模式。这为设计更高效的自然语言交互系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Embodiment shapes how users verbally express intent when interacting with
data through speech interfaces in immersive analytics. Despite growing interest
in Natural Language Interaction (NLI) for visual analytics in immersive
environments, users' speech patterns and their use of embodiment cues in speech
remain underexplored. Understanding their interplay is crucial to bridging the
gap between users' intent and an immersive analytic system. To address this, we
report the results from 15 participants in a user study conducted using the
Wizard of Oz method. We performed axial coding on 1,280 speech acts derived
from 734 utterances, examining how analysis tasks are carried out with
embodiment and linguistic features. Next, we measured speech input uncertainty
for each analysis task using the semantic entropy of utterances, estimating how
uncertain users' speech inputs appear to an analytic system. Through these
analyses, we identified five speech input patterns, showing that users
dynamically blend embodied and non-embodied speech acts depending on data
analysis tasks, phases, and embodiment reliance driven by the counts and types
of embodiment cues in each utterance. We then examined how these patterns align
with user reflections on factors that challenge speech interaction during the
study. Finally, we propose design implications aligned with the five patterns.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视力受损者对未来CAI工具的愿景，强调了设计应支持其自主性，并回应其担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究PVI如何设想与CAI共存的未来，从而为CAI的设计提供新的视角。

Method: 进行了一项包含14名视力受损参与者的研究，使用音频设计虚构探针呈现了参与者与未来CAI之间的虚构对话。

Result: 参与者想象使用CAI来扩展边界，探索新的机会或地方，但也对过度依赖CAI、维护自主权、多样的视力损失水平以及提高PVI可见性以实现更大包容性的必要性表示了关切。

Conclusion: 未来的CAI工具对于PVI用户应该支持真正的自主性，并考虑到他们设想的未来生活方式。

Abstract: People with visual impairments (PVI) use a variety of assistive technologies
to navigate their daily lives, and conversational AI (CAI) tools are a growing
part of this toolset. Much existing HCI research has focused on the technical
capabilities of current CAI tools, but in this paper, we instead examine how
PVI themselves envision potential futures for living with CAI. We conducted a
study with 14 participants with visual impairments using an audio-based Design
Fiction probe featuring speculative dialogues between participants and a future
CAI. Participants imagined using CAI to expand their boundaries by exploring
new opportunities or places, but also voiced concerns about balancing reliance
on CAI with maintaining autonomy, the need to consider diverse levels of
vision-loss, and enhancing visibility of PVI for greater inclusion. We discuss
implications for designing CAI that support genuine agency for PVI based on the
future lives they envisioned.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DIANA is a multimodal assistant that simplifies dashboard onboarding through chat, audio, and mouse interactions, reducing the need for manual onboarding and leveraging recent advances in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to alleviate the labor-intensive process of preparing and updating onboarding materials for dashboard users by leveraging multimodal interactions powered by large language models.

Method: The study introduces DIANA, a multimodal dashboard assistant, and conducts a qualitative user study to explore the effectiveness and preferences for different interaction modalities in onboarding tasks.

Result: The implementation of DIANA allows users to utilize various interaction modalities such as chat, audio, and mouse to learn and navigate dashboards independently, enhancing user orientation without the typical reliance on text-based interactions.

Conclusion: DIANA offers an innovative approach to self-guided onboarding for users interacting with dashboards by integrating multimodal interaction capabilities, thereby reducing the need for manual onboarding sessions.

Abstract: Visualization dashboards are regularly used for data exploration and
analysis, but their complex interactions and interlinked views often require
time-consuming onboarding sessions from dashboard authors. Preparing these
onboarding materials is labor-intensive and requires manual updates when
dashboards change. Recent advances in multimodal interaction powered by large
language models (LLMs) provide ways to support self-guided onboarding. We
present DIANA (Dashboard Interactive Assistant for Navigation and Analysis), a
multimodal dashboard assistant that helps users for navigation and guided
analysis through chat, audio, and mouse-based interactions. Users can choose
any interaction modality or a combination of them to onboard themselves on the
dashboard. Each modality highlights relevant dashboard features to support user
orientation. Unlike typical LLM systems that rely solely on text-based chat,
DIANA combines multiple modalities to provide explanations directly in the
dashboard interface. We conducted a qualitative user study to understand the
use of different modalities for different types of onboarding tasks and their
complexities.

TL;DR: 该研究通过开发沉浸式VR小组面试系统，并结合眼动追踪技术，研究VR环境中社会比较对参与者注意力和自我概念的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VR面试训练中的群体面试心理动态，特别是社会比较现象。

Method: 开发沉浸式VR小组面试系统，进行眼动追踪研究，操控同伴表现以测量其对参与者注意力和自我概念的影响。

Result: 结果表明，高成就同伴行为会增加社会比较信息处理，降低参与者自我评估，引入客观分数进一步加剧比较行为，且VR环境的低拟真度与较高的焦虑感相关。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VR中存在的“大小鱼塘效应”，即高成就同伴行为增加了参与者对社会比较信息的处理，并显著降低了自我评估。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) is a promising tool for interview training, yet the
psychological dynamics of group interviews, such as social comparison, remain
underexplored. We investigate this phenomenon by developing an immersive VR
group interview system and conducting an eye-tracking study with 73
participants. We manipulated peer performance using ambiguous behavioral cues
(e.g., hand-raising) and objective information (public test scores) to measure
their effect on participants' attention and self-concept. Our results
demonstrate a "Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect" in VR: an increase in
high-achieving peer behaviors heightened participants' processing of social
comparison information and significantly lowered their self-assessments. The
introduction of objective scores further intensified these comparative
behaviors. We also found that lower perceived realism of the VR environment
correlated with higher anxiety. These findings offer key insights and design
considerations for creating more effective and psychologically-aware virtual
training environments that account for complex social dynamics.

TL;DR: 人工智能算法在高质量评委分配中与人类专家表现相当，并显著提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对人工智能在复杂决策任务中应用的兴趣逐渐增加，研究旨在探明算法在需要语义理解和领域专长的环境中能否与人类判断相媲美，通过评委分配问题验证人工智能的效能。

Method: 使用人工智能算法HLSE对评委任务进行自动化分配，并通过Mann-Whitney U统计检验评估算法与人工分配的匹配质量。共对309个评委与参赛项目匹配对进行评估，结果显示两种分配方式质量无显著差异。

Result: 该研究探讨了人工智能在复杂决策任务中的应用，尤其是在需要语义理解和专业知识的环境中。如果人类判断与算法进行对比，人工智能是否能胜任这样的角色。本文以哈佛大学总统创新挑战赛的评委分配问题为例，开发了一个名为HLSE的评委分配算法，并与人类专家的分配结果进行对比。结果显示，两者的匹配质量没有统计学上的显著性差异，但算法显著提高了分配效率。

Conclusion: HLSE算法在匹配质量上达到人类专家水平，同时通过自动化显著提高了效率和可扩展性，展现出支持复杂决策任务的潜力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear
how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic
understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge
assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.
Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation
Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000
to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where
high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based
judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),
and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against
human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on
$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we
found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the
two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated
$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an
excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a
full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during
deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level
matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,
underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human
decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期以来，数据处理和模型优化之间的固有分隔问题一直困扰着机器学习领域。大型语言模型的兴起解决了这一历史性障碍，这种变化使得数据模型的共同演化成为可能。

Method: 研究中设计了一个交互系统，该系统的结构化工作流引导用户发现边缘案例，说明期望行为的理由，并对指令修订进行迭代评估，从而反映在不断增长的测试集中。

Result: 用户研究显示，该系统工作流程帮助参与者系统地优化指令，并更具体地指定模糊的政策。

Conclusion: 该研究工作指出，通过人机交互的开发流程，可以实现更稳健和负责任的大型语言模型应用，这些应用能够与本地偏好和政策保持一致。

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in machine learning has been the rigid separation
between data work and model refinement, enforced by slow fine-tuning cycles.
The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) overcomes this historical barrier,
allowing applications developers to instantly govern model behavior by editing
prompt instructions. This shift enables a new paradigm: data-model
co-evolution, where a living test set and a model's instructions evolve in
tandem. We operationalize this paradigm in an interactive system designed to
address the critical challenge of encoding subtle, domain-specific policies
into prompt instructions. The system's structured workflow guides people to
discover edge cases, articulate rationales for desired behavior, and
iteratively evaluate instruction revisions against a growing test set. A user
study shows our workflow helps participants refine instructions systematically
and specify ambiguous policies more concretely. This work points toward more
robust and responsible LLM applications through human-in-the-loop development
aligned with local preferences and policies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究揭示了LLM作为评估者的正向偏见，并提出了一种少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，有效减轻了偏差，提高了复杂代码反馈任务的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM作为评估者存在正向偏见，无法可靠地识别无效输出，导致可靠性评分虚高。虽然集成方法如多数投票可以帮助改善，但效果有限，需要更精准的方法。

Method: 研究中提出了一种少数否决最优策略和一种新颖的基于回归的框架。少数否决策略在面临数据缺失时表现出恢复力，并在很大程度上减轻了偏差。同时，回归框架通过使用一小部分人类标注的真实数据，直接对验证器的偏差进行建模。

Result: 在包含366个高中Python程序的复杂代码反馈任务中，采用回归方法的最大绝对误差仅为1.2%，实现了相较于最佳的14个LLM集成方法2倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: 在挑战性较高的代码反馈任务中，通过使用人类标注的少量真实数据来直接建模验证器偏差，回归方法将最大绝对误差减少到仅1.2%，比最好的14个先进LLM组合提高2倍。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在变异和基因解读领域手动且劳动密集，生成语言模型可以加速基础研究转化为临床可操作见解。

Method: 利用从ClinGen提取的专家审核文献解释资源，构建CGBench基准测试，评估生成语言模型对科学出版物的推理能力。

Result: 测试了8款不同的生成语言模型，发现模型虽然在细粒度任务上表现出色，但在文献解读上仍存在显著差距，特别是在细粒度指令上。推理模型在细粒度任务上表现优异，而非推理模型更擅长高层次解读。通过LM评估法衡量LM解释与人类解释，发现模型经常臆测或误解结果，即使能正确分类证据。

Conclusion: CGBench展示了生成语言模型在临床遗传学和科学解读上的优势和不足，揭示了未来在临床遗传学和科学领域应用AI的研究方向。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

TL;DR: 通过提出一个两阶段的模型训练方法，增强大型语言模型生成有效澄清问题的能力，以更好地获取用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了个性化大型语言模型的响应，在用户历史有限的情况下汲取用户偏好非常重要。为了获取更多信息，可以向用户提出澄清性问题。然而，在各领域生成有效的连续澄清问题仍然是个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种灵感来源于扩散模型的二阶段方法。首先，从用户档案出发，正向过程生成澄清问题以获得答案，然后逐步去除这些答案，即为用户档案添加“噪音”。逆向过程则涉及训练模型通过学习提出有效的澄清问题来“去噪”用户档案。

Result: 该方法显著提高了大型语言模型在提问引导性问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了大型语言模型在提问引导性问题和有效获取用户偏好方面的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions

TL;DR: Ax-Prover是一种自动定理证明系统，结合LLMs和Lean工具，能够跨科学领域解决问题，并在新测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了创建一个能够自动证明科学领域中复杂定理的系统，Ax-Prover在多领域间寻求解决方案。这个系统旨在既能独立操作也能与人类专家协作。

Method: 使用模型上下文协议（MCP）将大型语言模型（LLMs）与Lean工具结合，确保创意推理和严格语法的统一。进行基准测试以评估其性能。

Result: Ax-Prover在公开数据集上能够与最先进的证明工具竞争，并在新的基准测试中表现优异，显示出该系统能够在各科学领域实现通用性的方法。

Conclusion: Ax-Prover展示了一种可通用于多个科学领域的方法，并在复杂定理的形式化上证明能够支持专业数学家。

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 现有的代码生成基准测试主要评估语言模型在函数正确性上的表现，但忽略了对合约遵循性的评估。PACT提出了一种新的评估框架，用以系统性地评估和提升生成代码对合约的遵循情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能评估代码对合约的遵循性，生成代码缺乏应对异常输入的能力，因此需要一种能够对此进行评估的新框架。

Method: PACT框架通过扩展现有的测试集以包括合约违反情况、分析不同提示条件下的代码生成表现并引入新评估指标来实现对代码生成的合约遵循性评估。

Result: PACT框架展示了在提示中添加合约违反测试案例可显著提升模型合约遵循性的能力，并通过新指标揭示了常规基准测试忽略的重要错误。

Conclusion: PACT框架填补了评估语言模型生成代码合约遵循性的空白，通过提供全面的测试用例集、系统分析代码生成情况以及引入新的评估指标，增强了生成代码的稳健性和可靠性。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究引入地理空间意识层使大语言模型能够将地理数据纳入分析，提高灾害响应的有效性和资源分配建议的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法常常缺乏语义背景，无法有效地在事件中进行泛化，且解释性有限。大语言模型虽然具备少样本泛化能力，但仅限于文本，缺乏地理视角。为此，研究引入了地理空间意识层，实现基于位置的数据融合以改善灾害响应。

Method: 本文通过引入地理空间意识层（Geospatial Awareness Layer, GAL），自动从外部地理数据库中检索并整合基础设施、人口统计、地形和天气信息，以丰富上下文，促进分析。

Result: 通过在多个大语言模型中评估框架，结果表明，与基线相比，具有地理空间基础的智能体能够在实际野火场景中表现更优异。

Conclusion: 所提框架能够扩展至其他灾害情景，如洪水和飓风，显示出广泛的适应性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

TL;DR: 提出了ThinkPilot框架，无需训练即可优化大型推理模型的推理能力，提高准确性、安全性及指令遵循。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型推理模型在推理方面效率低且容易偏离目标，需要一种方法来自动优化其推理过程。

Method: 一种无训练基础的框架，通过进化过程生成指导性的前缀，以优化大型推理模型的推理能力。

Result: ThinkPilot显著提高了推理效率和准确性，改善了安全性和指令遵循能力，并能与现有的训练方法协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过自动识别并引出模型的特定推理行为，ThinkPilot为大型推理模型与任务需求的对齐提供了一种通用框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Method: 该研究提出了 HiCoTraj 方法，即通过分层链式思维引导语言模型进行人口推理的方法。具体而言，将人类移动轨迹转化为自然语言表征，并通过分层链式思维引导过程，分为三个阶段：事实特征提取、行为模式分析和结构化输出的人口推理。

Result: 通过在真实世界的轨迹数据上进行实验评估，HiCoTraj 在多个人口属性的零样本场景中取得了竞争性能表现。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj 框架通过利用语言模型的零样本学习能力和语义理解能力，不需要带标签的数据就能够进行有效的人口属性推理。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 在大规模人口数据中，实现对个体级别的人类移动异常检测是一项重大挑战。

Method: 提出了一个无监督框架BeSTAD，通过模型空间语境和时间动态来捕获和学习个体化行为特征，并通过行为簇感知的建模机制，检测细粒度的行为异常。

Result: BeSTAD能够检测行为转变和偏离常规的行为，在大规模移动数据集中识别出表现出这些变化的个体。

Conclusion: BeSTAD通过学习个体行为直接从无标签数据中检测异常行为，推动了个性化和可解释的移动性分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper explores the ability of large language models to handle randomness. While they can create random-like outputs, their performance is inconsistent and deviates from expected results, indicating areas needing improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to investigate the capacities of large language models in generating and utilizing randomness effectively, which is essential for various tasks like decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and cryptography.

Method: The study involved designing a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of LLMs in tasks involving randomness. These experiments considered factors like accessibility to external tools, types of tasks, model states, and prompting strategies.

Result: The experiments showed that LLMs can produce outputs displaying some randomness. However, there are marked inconsistencies and significant deviations from expected results, indicating limitations in their current capabilities regarding randomness.

Conclusion: While large language models can generate outputs with some randomness, their performance is inconsistent and significantly deviates from expected behavior when handling tasks requiring randomness.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

Conclusion: OneLife框架成功地展示了在复杂随机环境中自动构建程序化世界模型的潜力，具有在极少人类指导下学习环境动态的能力。它在许多测试场景中表现优异，并提供了优越的规划策略。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

Conclusion: 实验显示出该方法在生成用户指定属性强度的文本上的高准确性，并且提高了在三个下游任务上的效率。

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: The motivation is to address the underexplored reasoning capabilities of LLMs in materials science by providing a comprehensive benchmark to assess and improve these capabilities.

Method: MatSciBench contains 1,340 college-level problems across six primary and 31 sub-fields, with a three-tier difficulty classification and questions featuring multimodal reasoning through visual contexts.

Result: Even high-performing models like Gemini-2.5-Pro achieve less than 80% accuracy, highlighting the complexity of MatSciBench and the challenges in materials science reasoning.

Conclusion: MatSciBench establishes a solid benchmark for evaluating and enhancing the scientific reasoning of large language models (LLMs) within materials science.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B

describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of

technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

### [231] [MedKGEval: A Knowledge Graph-Based Multi-Turn Evaluation Framework for Open-Ended Patient Interactions with Clinical LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12224)
*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval is a new framework improving LLM evaluation in medical contexts by simulating interactions and assessing responses using a structured knowledge graph, successfully identifying overlooked flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of evaluating LLMs in medical applications, especially for multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that need dynamic and context-sensitive assessment.

Method: The method involves a knowledge graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, in-situ turn-level evaluation with a Judge Agent, and a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark across eight LLMs.

Result: MedKGEval successfully identified subtle flaws and safety risks in existing LLMs that are often missed by traditional evaluation methods and supports bilingual evaluation for different languages.

Conclusion: MedKGEval can effectively evaluate LLMs in medical scenarios by simulating realistic interactions and assessing responses for correctness and safety. It provides a comprehensive benchmark capable of identifying flaws overlooked by conventional methods.

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PromptFlow is a framework designed to improve prompt engineering for LLMs through dynamic, automated methods using meta-learning and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of existing prompt engineering methodologies, which require specialized expertise and lack dynamic adaptability, by proposing a more systematic and automated framework.

Method: The paper introduces PromptFlow, a modular training framework inspired by TensorFlow, which employs gradient-based meta-learning and reinforcement learning methods to optimize prompt refinement.

Result: The experiments conducted on various datasets show that PromptFlow is effective in optimizing prompt engineering processes.

Conclusion: PromptFlow offers a systematic framework for dynamic prompt engineering in NLP, overcoming several limitations of manual and static approaches by integrating meta-learning and reinforcement learning strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出方法$\mathbf{T^3}$，通过控制信念偏差提高了强化学习中大语言模型的性能，显著提升了训练效果和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，大语言模型（LLMs）在处理复杂任务时常常需要与外部信息源交互并收集信息。然而，它们在推理能力上有限，容易导致信念偏差和问题状态的错误跟踪，这会影响强化学习训练的有效性。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为$\mathbf{T^3}$的方法，用于跟踪模型信念的偏差并在训练期间截断不具信息量的轨迹尾部，从而提高政策优化的稳定性和效率。

Result: $\mathbf{T^3}$在五个具有挑战性的任务中稳定提高了训练的稳定性、token的效率和最终性能，实现了最高30%的提升，同时减少了约25%的rollout token数量。

Conclusion: 对模型信念进行有效控制是开发强大而通用的基于LLM的主动推理模型的关键原则。

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG框架局限于处理文本内容，对于多模态信息环境的处理存在鸿沟，需要一种统一的多模态知识检索框架。

Method: 引入了双图构建，以捕获跨模态关系和文本语义，同时开发了跨模态混合检索方法，结合结构知识导航和语义匹配，进行有效推理。

Result: 在多模态基准测试上表现优越，特别是在长文档上，超过现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的范式，用于多模态知识访问，消除了现有系统的架构碎片化，将代码开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架有效地建议域分解，并通过结合LLM和CAS验证，促进AI工具在专业数学研究中的应用。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Result: 研究表明，最先进的LLM评估模型在面对倾向性输入时表现出鲁棒性，一般对其给予较低评分。通过提供详细的评分标准能够进一步增强其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，系统性地审查和改进评分标准能够提高LLM评估模型的公正性，并提出了一些减缓策略以确保实际通信情境中的AI评判公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

TL;DR: A DAG-based dialogue framework for medical interviews improves efficiency and user satisfaction in clinical workflows, though faced with some latency and sample diversity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the process of medical interviews by developing a dialogue system that can efficiently gather necessary patient information and integrate into clinical workflows while providing structured report synthesis.

Method: The system is designed as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions, utilizing hierarchical clustering for initial questioning, an expand-and-prune mechanism for adaptive conversation, and a termination logic for efficient interview conclusion. Automated report synthesis is included, guided by human-computer interaction principles.

Result: The patient application achieved low cognitive workload scores, high usability, and strong user satisfaction. The physician application also showed moderate workload with excellent usability and satisfaction. Both applications effectively integrated into clinical workflows.

Conclusion: The task-oriented dialogue system effectively integrates into clinical workflows to reduce cognitive demand and supports efficient report generation, despite some limitations like occasional system latency and a small evaluation sample.

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

Result: 研究建议了一种决策对齐的评估蓝图，强调功能空间的读数，如通路活动、空间邻域和临床相关终点。同时，建议进行操作符感知的数据设计、耐泄漏的划分和透明的校准与报告，以实现可重复的对比。

Conclusion: 本文通过提出一种面向操作符文法的Cell-State Latent (CSL) 观点，来组织跨模态的学习，旨在改善单一数据集和环境下的评估现状，并提高实验室和平台之间的可传输性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

Result: ProtoSiTex在酒店评论数据集上的实验表明性能达到最先进水平，同时提供忠实、符合人类的解释，是半解释多标签文本分类的稳健解决方案。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex通过双阶段交替训练及分层损失函数，增强解释性和一致性，是应对多标签文本分类的有效方法。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Motivation: 探索大规模推理模型在面对非典型游戏变体时应用适当规则的灵活性，并揭示现有模型在应对新规则或策略时的不足。

Method: 引入HardcoreLogic基准，包括10种游戏的5000多个谜题，通过三种维度（复杂性增加、非常规元素及无解谜题）系统地变换经典谜题，减少对快捷记忆的依赖。

Result: 对多种大规模推理模型进行评估，发现即使在现有基准中表现优异的模型，在HardcoreLogic上的表现也明显下降，表明其对记忆化模式有过度依赖，并在复杂性增加和微妙规则变化上表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大规模推理模型的局限性，并为提升高级逻辑推理能力设立了基准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

Method: ERA框架分为两个阶段：第一阶段是通过三种数据类型进行先验知识学习；第二阶段是建立在这些先验知识基础上的在线强化学习管道，通过设计自我总结、密集奖励形塑和轮级策略优化来改善智能体性能。

Result: 本文提出了一个名为ERA的两阶段框架，旨在应用于视觉语言模型（VLMs）以改善在复杂环境中的表现。

Conclusion: 通过大量实验，ERA-3B模型在高水平规划任务和低水平控制任务上均超过了现有的高级模型及过去的基准，展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and

in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =

Conclusion: CLUTCH提高了JavaScript模糊测试的效率，不仅增加了有效测试用例的数量，还提高了每个测试用例的覆盖率。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种方法CTRL-Rec，允许用户通过自然语言实时控制推荐系统，并在MovieLens数据集和Letterboxd用户的研究中证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在对推荐系统不满意时常缺乏细粒度的控制调整，而大语言模型可以通过自然语言请求提供解决方案。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLM）模拟用户对项目的语言请求批准情况，并训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断。这些预测被集成到传统推荐系统的信号加权中，并在部署阶段进行单次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 实验表明，CTRL-Rec方法在多样化请求下提供了细粒度控制，并在用户研究中受到积极评价。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec显著增强了用户对推荐系统的控制感和满意度。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

TL;DR: 大规模实验证明，仅通过调整MARL的超参数，可以显著提高系统的协作性、鲁棒性和恢复能力；但这些特性不能在所有不确定性情形下普遍适用，需根据具体情况调节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在理想的模拟环境中调整超参数以最大化协作性能的做法在面对真实世界的不确定性时往往无法维持系统的鲁棒性和恢复能力。为了构建值得信赖的MARL系统，需要深入理解鲁棒性和恢复能力。

Method: 这篇论文通过开展大规模实验证明了在不同的不确定性环境下对MARL中的协作、鲁棒性和恢复能力的影响，其中包含超过82620个实验，覆盖4个真实环境、13种不确定性类型和15个超参数。

Result: 在温和的不确定性下，优化协作能提高鲁棒性和恢复能力，但这种关联在扰动加剧时减弱。鲁棒性和恢复能力会因算法和不确定性类型而异。标准超参数调优方法可能对鲁棒性有害，而早停、高学习率和Leaky ReLU则有正面效果。

Conclusion: 通过调整超参数可以显著改善MARL系统的协作性、鲁棒性和恢复能力，这一结果在各种MARL框架中普遍适用。

Abstract: In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), it is a common
practice to tune hyperparameters in ideal simulated environments to maximize
cooperative performance. However, policies tuned for cooperation often fail to
maintain robustness and resilience under real-world uncertainties. Building
trustworthy MARL systems requires a deep understanding of robustness, which
ensures stability under uncertainties, and resilience, the ability to recover
from disruptions--a concept extensively studied in control systems but largely
overlooked in MARL. In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study
comprising over 82,620 experiments to evaluate cooperation, robustness, and
resilience in MARL across 4 real-world environments, 13 uncertainty types, and
15 hyperparameters. Our key findings are: (1) Under mild uncertainty,
optimizing cooperation improves robustness and resilience, but this link
weakens as perturbations intensify. Robustness and resilience also varies by
algorithm and uncertainty type. (2) Robustness and resilience do not generalize
across uncertainty modalities or agent scopes: policies robust to action noise
for all agents may fail under observation noise on a single agent. (3)
Hyperparameter tuning is critical for trustworthy MARL: surprisingly, standard
practices like parameter sharing, GAE, and PopArt can hurt robustness, while
early stopping, high critic learning rates, and Leaky ReLU consistently help.
By optimizing hyperparameters only, we observe substantial improvement in
cooperation, robustness and resilience across all MARL backbones, with the
phenomenon also generalizing to robust MARL methods across these backbones.

### [246] [Heterogeneous RBCs via deep multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12272)
*Federico Gabriele,Aldo Glielmo,Marco Taboga*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The MARL-BC framework integrates deep MARL with RBC models, bridging heterogeneous-agent GE models and ABMs, offering flexibility and computational efficiency in modeling agent heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges and limitations of current macroeconomic models that deal with agent heterogeneity, such as computational complexity and the need for explicit behavioural rules.

Method: The paper introduces MARL-BC, a framework combining deep multi-agent reinforcement learning with real business cycle models. This new approach aims to integrate elements of heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium models and agent-based models.

Result: The framework can simulate rich agent heterogeneity, recover results from both RBC models and KS models, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility in economic modeling.

Conclusion: MARL-BC framework offers a promising synthesis of heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium models and agent-based models by integrating deep multi-agent reinforcement learning with real business cycle models. It effectively addresses the limitations of both approaches, providing a flexible and computationally feasible way to model agent heterogeneity.

Abstract: Current macroeconomic models with agent heterogeneity can be broadly divided
into two main groups. Heterogeneous-agent general equilibrium (GE) models, such
as those based on Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian (HANK) or Krusell-Smith
(KS) approaches, rely on GE and 'rational expectations', somewhat unrealistic
assumptions that make the models very computationally cumbersome, which in turn
limits the amount of heterogeneity that can be modelled. In contrast,
agent-based models (ABMs) can flexibly encompass a large number of arbitrarily
heterogeneous agents, but typically require the specification of explicit
behavioural rules, which can lead to a lengthy trial-and-error
model-development process. To address these limitations, we introduce MARL-BC,
a framework that integrates deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with
Real Business Cycle (RBC) models. We demonstrate that MARL-BC can: (1) recover
textbook RBC results when using a single agent; (2) recover the results of the
mean-field KS model using a large number of identical agents; and (3)
effectively simulate rich heterogeneity among agents, a hard task for
traditional GE approaches. Our framework can be thought of as an ABM if used
with a variety of heterogeneous interacting agents, and can reproduce GE
results in limit cases. As such, it is a step towards a synthesis of these
often opposed modelling paradigms.
