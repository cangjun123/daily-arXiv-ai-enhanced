The economic argument is similar\nacross domains: use CAI to automate the time-consuming conversations required\nfor customer, client or patient support. Herein we draw on our work in dementia\ncare to explore some of the challenges and opportunities for CAI, and how a new\nway of conceptualising these systems could help ensure essential aspects for\nhuman thriving are not lost in the process of automation."}
