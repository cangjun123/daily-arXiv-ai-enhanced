TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个解决3D网格显著性标注问题的稳健框架，引入视锥采样策略和混合流形-欧几里得约束扩散算法，提供高保真的人类视觉注意力获取方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D网格显著性标注获取方法与2D图像方法过于一致，忽略了3D几何拓扑与2D图像阵列的差异，现有VR眼动追踪方法依赖单射线采样和欧几里得平滑，导致纹理注意力和信号泄漏问题。

Method: 首先提出视锥采样策略，通过高斯分布射线束模拟人类中央凹感受野；然后开发混合流形-欧几里得约束扩散算法，融合流形测地约束与欧几里得尺度，确保拓扑一致的显著性传播。

Result: 该框架通过缓解'拓扑短路'和混叠问题，提供了符合自然人类感知的高保真3D注意力获取范例。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D网格显著性研究提供了更准确、更稳健的基准，改善了VR中人类中心视觉建模的可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable 3D mesh saliency ground truth (GT) is essential for human-centric visual modeling in virtual reality (VR). However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating "topological short-circuits" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces two critical challenges: scarcity of labeled data and lack of model interpretability, both hindering clinical AI deployment. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses data limitations but lacks transparency in predictions. Active learning (AL) methods optimize data acquisition but overlook interpretability of acquired samples. We propose a dual-framework solution: Expert-Guided Explainable Few-Shot Learning (EGxFSL) and Explainability-Guided AL (xGAL). EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\%, 76\%, and 62\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\% for random sampling. Grad-CAM visualizations demonstrate guided models focus on diagnostically relevant regions, with generalization validated on breast ultrasound confirming cross-modality applicability.

TL;DR: CoCoT框架通过动态多区域定位和关系感知推理，解决现有跨模态推理方法依赖单一粗粒度图像区域和语义碎片化的问题，显著提升复杂视觉推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有链式思维方法在跨模态场景中存在过度依赖单一粗粒度图像区域和连续推理步骤间语义碎片化两大局限，提出了CoCoT框架。

Method: CoCoT框架包含两个关键创新：1）动态多区域定位，基于问题自适应检测最相关图像区域；2）关系感知推理，通过迭代对齐视觉线索实现多区域协作，形成连贯逻辑的思维链。

Result: 构建了包含74,691个高质量样本、含多区域标注和结构化推理链的CoCoT-70K数据集。在六个挑战性基准测试中，CoCoT显著提升了复杂视觉推理性能，在LLaVA-1.5上平均精度提升15.4%，在Qwen2-VL上提升4.0%。

Conclusion: CoCoT框架通过动态多区域定位和关系感知推理，有效解决了跨模态推理中的关键问题，显著提升了视觉语言模型的复杂推理能力，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal reasoning requires the seamless integration of visual and linguistic cues, yet existing Chain-of-Thought methods suffer from two critical limitations in cross-modal scenarios: (1) over-reliance on single coarse-grained image regions, and (2) semantic fragmentation between successive reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Corner cases are rare or extreme scenarios that drive real-world failures, but they are difficult to curate at scale: web data are noisy, labels are brittle, and edge deployments preclude large retraining. We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints. Code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: We introduce NitroGen, a vision-action foundation model for generalist gaming agents that is trained on 40,000 hours of gameplay videos across more than 1,000 games. We incorporate three key ingredients: 1) an internet-scale video-action dataset constructed by automatically extracting player actions from publicly available gameplay videos, 2) a multi-game benchmark environment that can measure cross-game generalization, and 3) a unified vision-action model trained with large-scale behavior cloning. NitroGen exhibits strong competence across diverse domains, including combat encounters in 3D action games, high-precision control in 2D platformers, and exploration in procedurally generated worlds. It transfers effectively to unseen games, achieving up to 52% relative improvement in task success rates over models trained from scratch. We release the dataset, evaluation suite, and model weights to advance research on generalist embodied agents.

*Yuan Li,Shin'ya Nishida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究文本推理在盲图像质量评估中作用，发现仅用文本预测质量性能显著下降，自一致性范式大幅缩小图文预测差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本信息如何贡献于质量预测，以及文本多大程度能表示与分数相关的图像内容，从信息流角度理解图文评分关系

Method: 比较三种学习图文评分关系的范式：思维链、自一致性和自动编码器，通过实验评估视觉与文本条件下的预测差距

Result: 现有模型仅用文本时性能显著下降；思维链范式对BIQA改进有限；自一致性范式将图文预测的PLCC/SRCC差距缩小至0.02/0.03；自动编码器范式效果较弱但揭示优化方向

Conclusion: 为改进BIQA和其他高级视觉任务的文本推理提供了见解，特别强调了自一致性范式在缩小图文预测差距方面的有效性

Abstract: Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.

*Li Wang,Xi Chen,XiangWen Deng,HuaHui Yi,ZeKun Jiang,Kang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了多模态大语言模型在医疗图像分类任务中的适用性，发现MLLM在膝关节骨关节炎X光片分类中表现不佳，传统视觉编码器反而更优，建议针对特定医学分类任务应优先优化视觉编码器并精心设计数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医学视觉问答和报告生成方面表现优异，但这些能力未能可靠地迁移到疾病特异性分类任务。鉴于膝关节骨关节炎影响全球3-4亿人，但在现有医学MLLM基准中代表性不足，需要系统评估MLLM在该关键诊断任务中的实际效能。

Method: 通过系统消融研究，操作视觉编码器、连接器和大语言模型三大组件，并采用多样化训练策略，量化各组件对诊断准确性的贡献。比较了仅使用视觉编码器与完整MLLM管线的性能差异，并评估不同规模和质量数据集的影响。

Result: 训练后的视觉编码器单独使用时在分类准确率上优于全MLLM管线；微调LLM相比基于prompt的指导无明显改进；在小型均衡数据集上的LoRA微调优于大型但类别不平衡数据集的结果。

Conclusion: 对于领域特定的医学分类任务，LLM更适合作为解释器和报告生成器，而非主要分类器。MLLM架构不太适合需要高确定性的医学图像诊断分类。建议在开发临床适用系统时，优先优化视觉编码器并进行精心的数据集构建。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promising performance on medical visual question answering (VQA) and report generation, but these generation and explanation abilities do not reliably transfer to disease-specific classification. We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.

*Bennet Kahrs,Julia Andresen,Fenja Falta,Monty Santarossa,Heinz Handels,Timo Kepp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对各向异性的OCT图像，提出了两种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的框架，实现视网膜的稠密3D分析：1）结合en-face模态信息的B-scan插值；2）构建分辨率无关的视网膜图集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床OCT成像存在大切片间距导致的高度各向异性，传统2D方法无法保证相邻B-scan结果的一致性且受限于训练数据分辨率。INR具有连续表征和分辨率无关特性，适合解决此问题。

Method: 1）通过引入en-face模态辅助信息进行B-scan间插值，保持结构连续性；2）构建分辨率无关的视网膜图集，支持泛化分析。两种方法均基于可泛化的INR，利用群体数据进行训练。

Result: 提出的分辨率无关框架能够处理大B-scan间距的OCT图像，实现了对视网膜结构和病理的立体评估。

Conclusion: 基于INR的框架突破了传统方法的限制，为各向异性OCT数据的3D分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.

Abstract: Current foundation models for 3D shapes excel at global tasks (retrieval, classification) but transfer poorly to local part-level reasoning. Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos such as movies requires integrating visual and dialogue cues to answer complex questions. Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary "facts" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization is a critical research task, given that forged images may have a significant societal impact of various aspects. Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as "shallowfakes") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques ("deepfakes"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels. Our evaluation results show that our proposed method achieved higher inference accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

*Aniruddha Mahapatra,Long Mai,Cusuh Ham,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamLoop是一个创新的框架，专门从单张照片生成可控的cinemagraphs（电影静帧），无需专门训练数据集。它通过改造通用视频扩散模型实现高质量、自定义循环动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频动画技术局限性大，只能处理简单、低频的运动和重复纹理场景，无法生成复杂、无缝循环的cinemagraphs。同时，通用视频扩散模型缺乏针对cinemagraph特定约束的优化和专业数据。

Method: 通过训练通用视频扩散模型来实现：1) 时间桥接，2) 运动条件。推理时输入图像同时作为首尾帧以确保无缝循环，使用静态轨迹维持背景静止，并提供用户指定的运动路径来控制目标物体的动画轨迹和时机。

Result: 实验结果显示DreamLoop能够生成高质量且复杂的cinemagraphs，与用户意图吻合度很高，并且其表现超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamLoop是首个能够为通用场景生成具有灵活、直观控件的cinemagraphs的方法，在单张照片上实现了超越现有技术的可控视频合成能力。

Abstract: Cinemagraphs, which combine static photographs with selective, looping motion, offer unique artistic appeal. Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls. We demonstrate that our method produces high-quality, complex cinemagraphs that align with user intent, outperforming existing approaches.

*Shuman He,Xiehua Li,Xioaju Yang,Yang Xiong,Keqin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的人工智能生成图像检测范式，即绿色通道去除重建误差（GRRE）方法，通过分析消除绿色通道后重建误差的差异来识别AI生成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型（如扩散模型和GANs）的迅猛发展，合成图像与真实图像的区分日益困难。现有检测方法在面对新型或未见过的生成模型时准确率下降，反映出泛化能力不足的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于通道去除重建的检测方法。观察到当从真实图像中移除绿色通道并进行重建时，其重建误差与AI生成图像的重建误差存在显著差异。基于这一观察，开发了GRRE方法，利用这种差异来检测AI生成图像。

Result: 大量实验表明，GRRE在多种生成模型（包括训练时未见过的模型）中都能实现高检测准确率。与现有方法相比，GRRE不仅能有效抵抗干扰和后处理操作，还展现出更优异的跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，基于通道去除的重构方法有潜力成为生成AI时代保障图像真实性的强大取证工具。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.

Motivation: 解决从2D视频向3D资产迁移运动时的姿态模糊性和物体形状多样性问题，克服现有方法需要类别特定参数化模板的限制

Method: 提出形态参数化的关节3D高斯溅射模型结合密集语义对应，通过优化联合调整形状和姿态，有效缓解形状-姿态模糊性

Result: 实验结果显示在运动准确性、效率和视觉一致性方面优于现有方法，显著推进了不同物体类别和日常视频场景的运动迁移

Conclusion: CAMO框架实现了类别无关、无需模板的运动迁移，为多样化的3D运动合成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Motion transfer from 2D videos to 3D assets is a challenging problem, due to inherent pose ambiguities and diverse object shapes, often requiring category-specific parametric templates. We propose CAMO, a category-agnostic framework that transfers motion to diverse target meshes directly from monocular 2D videos without relying on predefined templates or explicit 3D supervision. The core of CAMO is a morphology-parameterized articulated 3D Gaussian splatting model combined with dense semantic correspondences to jointly adapt shape and pose through optimization. This approach effectively alleviates shape-pose ambiguities, enabling visually faithful motion transfer for diverse categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior motion accuracy, efficiency, and visual coherence compared to existing methods, significantly advancing motion transfer in varied object categories and casual video scenarios.

TL;DR: 这是一篇关于前景感知数据集蒸馏的论文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模模型训练的计算成本上升，数据集蒸馏成为一个有前景的方向。然而传统方法存在高计算开销、存储限制、生成噪声图像以及架构泛化能力受限等问题。最近的非优化方法通过使用真实图像块来缓解这些问题，但其固定的块选择策略可能会丢弃主要对象的关键信息。

Method: 首先利用Grounded SAM2识别前景对象并计算每张图像的前景占用率，从而推导出类别级别的块决策阈值。基于这些阈值，设计了一个动态块选择策略：对于每张图像，要么从多个候选块中选择最具信息量的块，要么在当前景占主导时直接调整整个图像的尺寸。这种双路径机制能在减少冗余背景内容的同时保留主要对象的更多关键信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法相比现有技术能一致性地提升蒸馏性能，生成更具信息性和代表性的蒸馏数据集，并增强在不同架构和图像构图上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种前景感知的数据集蒸馏方法，通过动态块选择策略有效地平衡了信息保留和背景简化，提高了蒸馏质量并在多个指标上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware dataset distillation method that enhances patch selection in a content-adaptive manner. With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.

Abstract: Visual localization on standard-definition (SD) maps has emerged as a promising low-cost and scalable solution for autonomous driving. However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released to foster future research.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as abnormality detection and report generation for anatomical modalities, their capability in functional imaging remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects plays a vital role in remote sensing intelligent interpretation, as these objects often carry critical information for downstream applications. However, due to the extremely limited pixel information and significant variations in object density, mainstream Transformer-based detectors often suffer from slow convergence and inaccurate query-object matching. To address these challenges, we propose D$^3$R-DETR, a novel DETR-based detector with Dual-Domain Density Refinement. By fusing spatial and frequency domain information, our method refines low-level feature maps and utilizes their rich details to predict more accurate object density map, thereby guiding the model to precisely localize tiny objects. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset demonstrate that D$^3$R-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors for tiny object detection.

Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. Code: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/BUFFER-X.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation aims to recover the depth information of 3D scenes from 2D images. Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AiOIR) has advanced significantly, offering promising solutions for complex real-world degradations. However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration. Experimental results show that ClearAIR achieves superior performance across diverse synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉溯因推理（VAR）任务中表现不如人类，需要弥补其在溯因推断方面的不足。受人类认知中语言与图像溯因交互的启发，旨在通过模拟这种双模态行为来增强MLLMs的溯因能力。

Method: 提出AbductiveMLLM框架，包含两个协同组件：REASONER（语言域）通过纯文本LLM生成可能解释，再基于跨模态因果对齐修剪视觉不一致假设；IMAGINER（图像域）使用文本到图像扩散模型结合输入视频和REASONER嵌入生成对应解释的可视化场景。两者端到端联合训练。

Result: 在标准VAR基准测试中，AbductiveMLLM取得最优性能，持续超越传统解决方案和先进MLLMs。

Conclusion: 通过模仿人类语言与图像双模态推理的AbductiveMLLM有效提升了MLLMs在视觉溯因推理任务上的表现，证明了双模态协同机制的优越性。

Abstract: Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to "imagine" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频风格化作为视频生成模型的重要下游任务尚未被充分探索。现有方法主要局限于单一类型的风格条件（文本、风格图像或风格化首帧），且缺乏高质量数据集，导致风格不一致和时间闪烁问题。

Method: 基于普通图像到视频模型，使用低秩适配（LoRA）和特定token的上矩阵来减少不同条件token之间的混淆，同时设计了一个数据整理流程来获取高质量的配对视频数据。

Result: DreamStyle在文本引导、风格图像引导和首帧引导的视频风格化任务中均表现优异，在风格一致性和视频质量方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamStyle提供了一个统一的视频风格化框架，成功解决了现有方法在风格条件限制、风格不一致和时间闪烁等方面的问题，为视频风格化任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization, an important downstream task of video generation models, has not yet been thoroughly explored. Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.

Abstract: Applying single image Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) models to video sequences introduces significant temporal instability and flickering artifacts. We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate improved temporal consistency, competitive state-of-the-art performance and on top 2x faster processing in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的拓扑感知框架有效解决了H&E到IHC虚拟染色的空间错位挑战，显著提升虚拟染色性能，为临床应用提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining provides crucial molecular characterization of tissue samples and plays an indispensable role in the clinical examination and diagnosis of cancers. However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks across four staining tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior generation quality with higher clinical relevance.

Conclusion: 素描式推理方法能显著提升大模型推理效率，减少计算开销，同时保持准确性，实现了类似人类的高效认知过程。

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of extensive, step-by-step reasoning in large multimodal models, long reasoning processes inevitably incur substantial computational overhead, i.e., in terms of higher token costs and increased response time, which undermines inference efficiency. In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.

Abstract: To fully exploit depth cues in Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), we present DGA-Net, a specialized framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) via a novel ``depth prompting" paradigm. Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), small target size, and complex cluttered backgrounds. Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.

Abstract: This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to interpret and describe all temporally localized events throughout an input video. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we show that our TA-Prompting is favorable against state-of-the-art VideoLLMs, yielding superior performance on dense video captioning and temporal understanding tasks including moment retrieval and temporalQA.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.

Abstract: Multi-modal vehicle Re-Identification (ReID) aims to leverage complementary information from RGB, Near Infrared (NIR), and Thermal Infrared (TIR) modalities to retrieve the same vehicle. The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PrismVAU是一种轻量级视频异常理解系统，无需微调多模态大语言模型或依赖外部模块，通过文本锚点相似度评分和提示工程实现实时异常检测与解释。

Conclusion: PrismVAU提供了一种高效实用的视频异常理解解决方案，适用于实时应用场景，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU) extends traditional Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) by not only localizing anomalies but also describing and reasoning about their context. Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为HybridSolarNet的新型太阳能电池板故障检测模型，它结合了EfficientNet-B0和CBAM注意力模块，通过焦点损失和余弦退火等技术，在保持轻量化的同时实现了高精度实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的太阳能电池板人工检测方法存在耗时、成本高且易出错的问题，而现有的深度学习模型要么体积过大不适合边缘设备部署，要么存在因学习技术不当导致的准确率估计偏差。

Method: 提出HybridSolarNet模型，集成EfficientNet-B0和卷积块注意力模块CBAM，采用分割-增强协议避免准确率泄露，引入焦点损失处理类别不平衡，使用余弦退火优化。在Kaggle数据集上进行5折分层交叉验证。

Result: 模型在竞争数据集上达到92.37%±0.41的平均准确率和0.9226±0.39的F1分数，仅需16.3MB存储空间（比VGG19小32倍），GPU推理速度达54.9 FPS。消融分析显示CBAM贡献了+1.53%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: HybridSolarNet是一个轻量高效的太阳能电池板故障检测模型，适合无人机实时部署，Grad-CAM可视化显示模型能够准确聚焦于相关特征区域。

Abstract: Manual inspections for solar panel systems are a tedious, costly, and error-prone task, making it desirable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based monitoring. Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation. Moreover, visualization obtained from Grad-CAM illustrates that HybridSolarNet focuses on actual locations instead of irrelevant ones.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce and digital fashion, image-based virtual try-on (VTON) has attracted increasing attention. However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本到图像编辑面临两个主要挑战：如何在保持原始内容的同时应用编辑效果，以及如何更好地处理真实图像编辑任务。现有的方法在这两个目标之间难以取得平衡。

Method: 提出LAMS（潜在和注意力混合调度）方法，利用反转过程中的中间状态——真实图像编辑的关键步骤。具体来说，在编辑图像生成的每一步中，将潜在表示和注意力图通过加权插值相结合，由调度器控制混合比例。该方法与Prompt-to-Prompt结合形成LAMS-Edit框架，支持区域掩码精确编辑和通过LoRA实现风格迁移。

Result: 大量实验表明，LAMS-Edit有效地平衡了内容保持和编辑应用，在保持原始图像内容的同时实现了高质量的编辑效果。

Conclusion: LAMS-Edit作为可扩展的编辑框架，通过利用去噪过程中的中间状态，成功解决了扩散模型在文本到图像编辑中的内容保持与编辑应用平衡问题，支持精确的区域编辑和风格迁移任务。

Abstract: Text-to-Image editing using diffusion models faces challenges in balancing content preservation with edit application and handling real-image editing. To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.

Motivation: 原ULS模型基于点击点中心区域进行全身CT病灶分割，但已有新公开数据集可用于进一步提升模型性能。

Method: 引入额外的公开数据集，并采用更小的输入图像尺寸进行训练优化。

Result: 在ULS23挑战赛测试数据和部分纵向CT数据集上，ULS+在Dice分数和点击点鲁棒性方面显著优于原始ULS，且在挑战赛测试榜单上排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过数据驱动的更新周期和临床验证，ULS+为构建鲁棒且临床相关的病灶分割模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this study, we present ULS+, an enhanced version of the Universal Lesion Segmentation (ULS) model. The original ULS model segments lesions across the whole body in CT scans given volumes of interest (VOIs) centered around a click-point. Since its release, several new public datasets have become available that can further improve model performance. ULS+ incorporates these additional datasets and uses smaller input image sizes, resulting in higher accuracy and faster inference.
  We compared ULS and ULS+ using the Dice score and robustness to click-point location on the ULS23 Challenge test data and a subset of the Longitudinal-CT dataset. In all comparisons, ULS+ significantly outperformed ULS. Additionally, ULS+ ranks first on the ULS23 Challenge test-phase leaderboard. By maintaining a cycle of data-driven updates and clinical validation, ULS+ establishes a foundation for robust and clinically relevant lesion segmentation models.

Abstract: Comic-based visual question answering (CVQA) poses distinct challenges to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to its reliance on symbolic abstraction, narrative logic, and humor, which differ from conventional VQA tasks. Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation. Across five challenging benchmarks, our 3B model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and plug-in experiments yield an additional average improvement of $\mathbf{12.1\%}$ across different MLLMs.

TL;DR: 针对车路协同感知中的带宽与特征冗余矛盾，提出风险意图选择性检测框架RiSe，通过潜在场-轨迹关联模型定量评估运动风险，并结合意图驱动区域预测模块预测关键BEV区域，实现仅传输高交互区域特征的语义选择性融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车路协同感知在自动驾驶中对于解决遮挡问题至关重要，但通信带宽与特征冗余之间的权衡仍是关键瓶颈。现有的中间融合方法通常依赖于空间压缩或静态置信图，无法有效处理非关键背景区域的空间冗余特征传输问题。

Method: 提出RiSe框架，包含两个核心模块：1) 基于势场理论的潜在场-轨迹关联模型(PTCM)定量评估运动风险；2) 利用自车运动先验的意图驱动区域预测模块(IDAPM)主动预测和过滤对决策关键的BEV区域。两者结合实现语义选择性融合，仅传输高交互区域的高保真特征。

Result: 在DeepAccident数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法将通信量降低至全特征共享的0.71%，同时保持最先进的检测精度，在带宽效率与感知性能之间建立了有竞争力的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: RiSe框架成功地将车路协同感知范式从识别可见区域转向优先考虑风险关键区域，通过语义选择性融合方案有效降低了通信开销，同时保持了高性能的感知能力。

Abstract: Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.

<details>

Motivation: 主动场景重建中，稀疏和宽基线视图会导致高斯分布监督不足，不确定性估计不可靠，影响下一最佳视图选择的效率和重建质量

Method: 1) 通过训练视图与栅格化外推视图之间的三角测量生成自增强点云(SA-Points)，进行场景覆盖估计
2) 引入首个针对3D高斯泼溅的残差学习策略
3) 结合不确定性驱动过滤与受dropout和硬负例挖掘启发的采样

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理引导的视图选择和不确定性感知的残差监督，提升了主动场景重建中不确定性量化的稳定性，有效缓解了宽基线探索和稀疏视图模糊性之间的冲突

Abstract: We propose Self-Augmented Residual 3D Gaussian Splatting (SA-ResGS), a novel framework to stabilize uncertainty quantification and enhancing uncertainty-aware supervision in next-best-view (NBV) selection for active scene reconstruction. SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning. Experiments on active view selection demonstrate that SA-ResGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction quality and view selection robustness.

TL;DR: DFRCP是一个动态模糊鲁棒卷积金字塔模块，作为YOLOv11的插件升级，用于增强在运动模糊条件下的目标检测性能。通过结合多尺度特征、引入动态鲁棒切换单元和透明卷积，在边缘设备上实现了高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机抖动导致的运动模糊会产生重影伪影，严重降低边缘侧目标检测的准确性。现有方法要么将模糊视为噪声并丢失判别性结构，要么进行全图像恢复增加延迟，无法在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 提出DFRCP模块：1）增强YOLOv11特征金字塔，结合大尺度和中尺度特征同时保留原始表征；2）引入动态鲁棒切换单元，自适应注入模糊特征以增强抖动下的全局感知；3）通过旋转和非线性插值合成多尺度模糊特征，通过透明卷积学习内容自适应的原始与模糊线索平衡；4）开发CUDA并行旋转和插值内核避免边界溢出，实现400倍加速。

Result: 在约3,500张图像的小麦病虫害私有数据集上进行训练，使用两种模糊增强方案。在模糊测试集上，YOLOv11+DFRCP比YOLOv11基线准确率提高约10.4%，仅有适度的训练时间开销，减少了数据收集后的人工筛选需求。

Conclusion: DFRCP作为YOLOv11的插件升级，能够在运动模糊条件下显著提升目标检测性能，同时保持边缘部署的实用性，通过CUDA优化实现了高效处理。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake produces ghosting artifacts that substantially degrade edge side object detection. Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.

TL;DR: ViTs在空间推理任务上存在系统性失败，源于架构内在的电路复杂性限制，而非数据规模不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在语义识别上表现优异，但在空间推理任务（如心理旋转）中表现出系统性失败。本文旨在探讨这种失败的根本原因，挑战了通常将其归因于数据规模的观点。

Method: 1. 将空间理解形式化为学习群同态：将图像序列映射到保持底层变换群代数结构的隐空间。2. 对非可解群（如三维旋转群SO(3)），证明保持这种结构保持嵌入的计算复杂度存在下界，由字问题决定（NC1-完全）。3. 证明具有多项式精度的恒定深度ViTs严格受限于TC0复杂度。4. 基于TC0 ⊊ NC1的假设，建立复杂度边界：恒定深度ViTs从根本上缺乏有效捕获非可解空间结构所需的逻辑深度。

Result: 通过隐空间探测验证了复杂度间隙，表明ViT表示在非可解任务上随着组合深度增加会发生结构性坍缩。

Conclusion: ViTs在空间推理任务上的局限性源于其架构的内在计算复杂性边界：恒定深度ViTs（TC0类）无法有效处理非可解群的空间结构（NC1-完全问题），这解释了它们在相关任务上的系统性失败。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in semantic recognition but exhibit systematic failures in spatial reasoning tasks such as mental rotation. While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\mathsf{TC^0} \subsetneq \mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures. We validate this complexity gap via latent-space probing, demonstrating that ViT representations suffer a structural collapse on non-solvable tasks as compositional depth increases.

Motivation: 现有医学MLLM分割方法存在两大挑战：1) 引入隐式分割标记需要同时微调MLLM和外部像素解码器，易导致灾难性遗忘且领域泛化能力受限；2) 大多依赖单次推理缺乏迭代细化能力，导致次优性能。

Conclusion: IBISAgent通过智能体化多步骤视觉推理方法，在保持架构不变的情况下显著提升了像素级医学图像理解能力，具有良好的泛化性和迭代优化特性。

Abstract: Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.

TL;DR: 提出CFSG模型通过解耦概念和特征空间为三部分结构组件：共性、特性、混杂段，并引入自适应机制动态调节三者比例，显著提升了细粒度域泛化任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度域泛化比传统域泛化更具挑战性，因为细粒度识别任务中的类间差异细微而类内变化显著。当前深度学习模型尚未有效结合人类认知中的共性和特性属性利用机制，导致在域偏移下过度敏感于细粒度线索而抑制关键特征。

Method: 受人类认知机制启发，提出概念-特征结构化泛化（CFSG）模型，将概念和特征空间显式解耦为共性、特性、混杂三个结构组件；引入自适应机制动态调整各组件比例；在最终预测中为每对组件分配显式权重。

Result: 在三个单源基准数据集上的实验表明，CFSG相比基线模型平均性能提升9.87%，优于现有最先进方法平均3.08%。可解释性分析验证了CFSG能有效整合多粒度结构化知识，并证实特征结构化促进了概念结构化的涌现。

Conclusion: CFSG通过概念和特征空间的结构化解耦与自适应调节机制，有效解决了细粒度域泛化中的挑战，显著提升了模型在域偏移下的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Domain Generalization (FGDG) presents greater challenges than conventional domain generalization due to the subtle inter-class differences and relatively pronounced intra-class variations inherent in fine-grained recognition tasks. Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) for stylised cartoon imagery presents challenges, such as interpreting exaggerated visual abstraction and narrative-driven context, which are not adequately addressed by standard large language models (LLMs) trained on natural images. To investigate this issue, a multi-agent LLM framework is introduced, specifically designed for VQA tasks in cartoon imagery. The proposed architecture consists of three specialised agents: visual agent, language agent and critic agent, which work collaboratively to support structured reasoning by integrating visual cues and narrative context. The framework was systematically evaluated on two cartoon-based VQA datasets: Pororo and Simpsons. Experimental results provide a detailed analysis of how each agent contributes to the final prediction, offering a deeper understanding of LLM-based multi-agent behaviour in cartoon VQA and multimodal inference.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically rely on a single late-layer feature from a frozen vision encoder, leaving the encoder's rich hierarchy of visual cues under-utilized. MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise "experts" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.

Abstract: Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.

Abstract: Precise and scalable instance segmentation of cell nuclei is essential for computational pathology, yet gigapixel Whole-Slide Images pose major computational challenges. Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image and video generation. However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements. We provide a detailed explanation of the DiffBench construction and the design principles underlying DiffAgent. Extensive experiments show that DiffBench offers a thorough evaluation of generated codes and that DiffAgent significantly outperforms existing LLMs in producing effective diffusion acceleration strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal medical large language models have shown impressive progress in chest X-ray interpretation but continue to face challenges in spatial reasoning and anatomical understanding. Although existing grounding techniques improve overall performance, they often fail to establish a true anatomical correspondence, resulting in incorrect anatomical understanding in the medical domain. To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by the radiological workflow, AnatomiX adopts a two stage approach: first, it identifies anatomical structures and extracts their features, and then leverages a large language model to perform diverse downstream tasks such as phrase grounding, report generation, visual question answering, and image understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 统一多模态模型（UMMs）在跨模态理解上取得显著进展，但其内部知识到高质量生成的能力存在显著差距（传导性失语现象）

Method: 提出UniCorn自优化框架：将单个UMM划分为提议者、求解者和评判者三个协作角色，通过自我游戏生成高质量交互，采用认知模式重构将潜在理解转化为显式生成信号

Result: 在6个通用图像生成基准测试中全面显著超越基础模型，在TIIF(73.8)、DPG(86.8)、CompBench(88.5)和UniCycle基准上达到SOTA，在WISE和OneIG上分别提升+5.0和+6.5

Conclusion: UniCorn方法显著增强T2I生成能力同时保持稳健理解力，证明了完全自监督细化在多模态智能统一中的可扩展性

Abstract: While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Recent text-to-video diffusion models can generate compelling video sequences, yet they remain silent -- missing the semantic, emotional, and atmospheric cues that audio provides. We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time. All model weights and code are publicly released.

Abstract: With the advancement of AIGC (AI-generated content) technologies, an increasing number of generative models are revolutionizing fields such as video editing, music generation, and even film production. However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.

Abstract: Existing depth estimation methods are fundamentally limited to predicting depth on discrete image grids. Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.

Abstract: We present Muses, the first training-free method for fantastic 3D creature generation in a feed-forward paradigm. Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as AI glasses are transforming voice assistants into always-available, hands-free collaborators that integrate seamlessly with daily life, but they also introduce challenges like egocentric audio affected by motion and noise, rapid micro-interactions, and the need to distinguish device-directed speech from background conversations. Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech. Our results highlight the critical importance of spatial audio cues for context-aware voice assistants and establish WearVox as a comprehensive testbed for advancing wearable voice AI research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, including software development, education, and technical assistance. Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.

Abstract: Complex agentic AI systems, powered by a coordinated ensemble of Large Language Models (LLMs), tool and memory modules, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on intricate, multi-turn tasks. However, this success is shadowed by prohibitive economic costs and severe latency, exposing a critical, yet underexplored, trade-off. We formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\%$ and latency by over $70\%$.

Abstract: Cooking recipes are complex procedures that require not only a fluent and factual text, but also accurate timing, temperature, and procedural coherence, as well as the correct composition of ingredients. Standard training procedures are primarily based on cross-entropy and focus solely on fluency. Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time.

Abstract: The iterated learning model simulates the transmission of language from generation to generation in order to explore how the constraints imposed by language transmission facilitate the emergence of language structure. Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.

Conclusion: ModeX提供了一种无需评估器的高效Best-of-N选择框架，通过识别语义主导模式显著提升开放文本生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Selecting a single high-quality output from multiple stochastic generations remains a fundamental challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in open-ended tasks where no canonical answer exists. While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation. Code is released in https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/ModeX.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human evaluation is the gold standard for multilingual NLP, but is often skipped in practice and substituted with automatic metrics, because it is notoriously complex and slow to set up with existing tools with substantial engineering and operational overhead. We introduce Pearmut, a lightweight yet feature-rich platform that makes end-to-end human evaluation as easy to run as automatic evaluation. Pearmut removes common entry barriers and provides support for evaluating multilingual tasks, with a particular focus on machine translation. The platform implements standard evaluation protocols, including DA, ESA, or MQM, but is also extensible to allow prototyping new protocols. It features document-level context, absolute and contrastive evaluation, attention checks, ESAAI pre-annotations and both static and active learning-based assignment strategies. Pearmut enables reliable human evaluation to become a practical, routine component of model development and diagnosis rather than an occasional effort.

Motivation: 现有评估医疗大语言模型信息收集和诊断推理能力的基准和框架缺乏严格评估，同时需要解决隐私和数据治理问题。

Method: 1. 使用多智能体系统从疾病知识合成现实患者记录（无需访问真实电子健康记录）；2. 设计有限知识但具备幻觉检测校正机制的Patient Agent；3. 提出基于EBM指南和拒绝采样的rubric生成管道，提取'必问'评估项。

Result: 对现有最先进模型的全面评估显示，在多个评估维度上当前模型面临重大挑战。

Conclusion: 改进医疗对话需要在对话管理架构上取得进展，而不仅仅是基础模型的增量调优。

Abstract: Medical conversational AI (AI) plays a pivotal role in the development of safer and more effective medical dialogue systems. However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items ("must-ask" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges. Our results indicate that improving medical dialogue will require advances in dialogue management architectures, not just incremental tuning of the base-model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了PCC框架，通过联合建模大语言模型的概率确定性和推理一致性来估计事实置信度，从而实现自适应的验证策略，在需要时触发检索以提高事实核查的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实准确性的应用中会产生幻觉响应。现有事实核查方法通常不加区分地检索外部证据，忽略了模型的内部知识，可能引入无关噪声。现有系统缺乏针对性机制来解决模型推理中的特定不确定性。

Method: 提出概率确定性和一致性（PCC）框架，通过联合建模语言模型的概率确定性和推理一致性来估计其实答置信度，并设计自适应验证策略：模型在置信度高时直接回答；在不确定或不一致时触发针对性检索；在模糊性高时进行深度搜索。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试中，PCC相比口头化置信度方法有更好的不确定性量化表现，持续超越基于大语言模型的强基线事实核查方法，并展现出良好的模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: PCC框架通过联合建模确定性和一致性来指导自适应检索，能够在保持效率的同时提高事实核查的可靠性，为大语言模型的实际应用提供了有效的置信度估计和验证策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring factual accuracy, yet their outputs often contain hallucinated responses. While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.

TL;DR: DataParasite是一个开源、模块化的在线数据收集管道，专门用于计算社会科学中的数据整理，通过分解表格整理任务，使用自然语言指令即可重用于新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算社会科学中许多研究依赖于从异构在线来源收集的数据集，但这个过程通常劳动密集、成本高、难以复现。现有的大语言模型搜索系统往往不透明、不灵活或不适合科学数据整理。

Method: 引入DataParasite管道，将表格整理任务分解为独立的实体级搜索，通过轻量级配置文件定义，并使用共享的任务无关Python脚本执行。相同的管道可以通过自然语言指令重新用于新任务，包括那些没有预定义实体列表的任务。

Result: 在多个经典计算社会科学任务（如教师聘用历史、精英死亡事件、政治生涯轨迹）上进行评估，DataParasite在实现高准确率的同时，将数据收集成本相对于手动整理降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 通过降低在线数据组装的技术和劳动门槛，DataParasite为计算社会科学及其他领域的可扩展、透明和可重复的数据整理提供了实用基础。

Abstract: Many questions in computational social science rely on datasets assembled from heterogeneous online sources, a process that is often labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to reproduce. Recent advances in large language models enable agentic search and structured extraction from the web, but existing systems are frequently opaque, inflexible, or poorly suited to scientific data curation. Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.

Motivation: 传统IRT参数估计方法依赖昂贵的实地测试收集学生表现数据，本研究旨在通过LLM模拟降低这一成本。

Method: 使用Qwen-3密集模型系列和LoRA微调技术，让模型根据离散能力描述符生成多项选择题的模拟反应。通过重构正确反应概率与能力的关系，生成合成ICC曲线来估计IRT参数。

Result: 在六年级英语语言艺术试题和BEA 2024共享任务数据集上评估，该方法与基线方法相当或更优，在建模试题区分度方面表现尤其有效。

Conclusion: 基于LLM模拟的方法为心理测量学参数估计提供了一种有前景的替代方案，特别是在建模试题区分度方面具有优势，能够显著降低传统实地测试的成本。

Abstract: Traditional methods for determining assessment item parameters, such as difficulty and discrimination, rely heavily on expensive field testing to collect student performance data for Item Response Theory (IRT) calibration. This study introduces a novel approach that implicitly models these psychometric properties by fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate student responses across a spectrum of latent abilities. Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters. Evaluation on a dataset of Grade 6 English Language Arts (ELA) items and the BEA 2024 Shared Task dataset demonstrates that this method competes with or outperforms baseline approaches. This simulation-based technique seems particularly effective at modeling item discrimination.

TL;DR: FlowPlan-G2P是一个创新框架，能够将科学论文自动转化为专利申请文件。它模拟专利专家的认知流程，将任务分解为三个推理阶段，在逻辑一致性和法律合规性方面优于端到端的LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每年专利申请数量巨大，而撰写专利说明书需要深厚的技术和法律专业知识。将科学论文转化为专利描述尤为困难，因为两者在修辞风格和法律要求上存在显著差异。传统的黑盒文本到文本方法难以建模结构推理和法律约束。

Method: FlowPlan-G2P框架将任务分为三个阶段：(1)概念图归纳：通过类似专家的推理提取技术实体和关系，构建有向图；(2)段落和章节规划：将图重组为与标准专利章节对齐的连贯聚类；(3)图条件生成：使用章节特定子图和定制提示生成法律合规的段落。

Result: 实验证明，FlowPlan-G2P在逻辑一致性和法律合规性方面显著优于端到端LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为从论文到专利的生成建立了新范式，并推动了专业领域结构化文本生成的进展。

Abstract: Over 3.5 million patents are filed annually, with drafting patent descriptions requiring deep technical and legal expertise. Transforming scientific papers into patent descriptions is particularly challenging due to their differing rhetorical styles and stringent legal requirements. Unlike black-box text-to-text approaches that struggle to model structural reasoning and legal constraints, we propose FlowPlan-G2P, a novel framework that mirrors the cognitive workflow of expert drafters by reformulating this task into three stages: (1) Concept Graph Induction, extracting technical entities and relationships into a directed graph via expert-like reasoning; (2) Paragraph and Section Planning, reorganizing the graph into coherent clusters aligned with canonical patent sections; and (3) Graph-Conditioned Generation, producing legally compliant paragraphs using section-specific subgraphs and tailored prompts. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPlan-G2P significantly improves logical coherence and legal compliance over end-to-end LLM baselines. Our framework establishes a new paradigm for paper-to-patent generation and advances structured text generation for specialized domains.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into biomedical research offers new opportunities for domainspecific reasoning and knowledge representation. However, their performance depends heavily on the semantic quality of training data. In oncology, where precision and interpretability are vital, scalable methods for constructing structured knowledge bases are essential for effective fine-tuning. This study presents a pipeline for developing a lung cancer knowledge base using Open Information Extraction (OpenIE). The process includes: (1) identifying medical concepts with the MeSH thesaurus; (2) filtering open-access PubMed literature with permissive licenses (CC0); (3) extracting (subject, relation, object) triplets using OpenIE method; and (4) enriching triplet sets with Named Entity Recognition (NER) to ensure biomedical relevance. The resulting triplet sets provide a domain-specific, large-scale, and noise-aware resource for fine-tuning LLMs. We evaluated T5 models finetuned on this dataset through Supervised Semantic Fine-Tuning. Comparative assessments with ROUGE and BERTScore show significantly improved performance and semantic coherence, demonstrating the potential of OpenIE-derived resources as scalable, low-cost solutions for enhancing biomedical NLP.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model sizes. However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting. We back our claims with promising experimental results.

Abstract: Long context may impose challenges for encoder-only language models in text processing, specifically for automated scoring of essays. This study trained several commonly used encoder-based language models for automated scoring of long essays. The performance of these trained models was evaluated and compared with the ensemble models built upon the base language models with a token limit of 512?. The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa. This study revealed that an ensemble-of-embeddings model that combines multiple pre-trained language model representations with gradient-boosting classifier as the ensemble model significantly outperforms individual language models at scoring long essays.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time planning and external tools to improve reasoning. We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\% $\rightarrow$ 67.5\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\sim$8s $\rightarrow$ $\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\% at $\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades. Overall, the findings highlight the need for task-specific, cost-aware choices of both model size and agent/tooling complexity.

Abstract: Most jailbreak methods achieve high attack success rates (ASR) but require attacker LLMs to craft adversarial queries and/or demand high query budgets. These resource limitations make jailbreaking expensive, and the queries generated by attacker LLMs often consist of non-interpretable random prefixes. This paper introduces Lexical Anchor Tree Search (), addressing these limitations through an attacker-LLM-free method that operates purely via lexical anchor injection. LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable. Our code will be released to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Many unresolved legal questions over LLMs and copyright center on memorization: whether specific training data have been encoded in the model's weights during training, and whether those memorized data can be extracted in the model's outputs. While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%). Taken together, our work highlights that, even with model- and system-level safeguards, extraction of (in-copyright) training data remains a risk for production LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of natural language processing tasks. However, their ever-growing scale introduces significant barriers to real-world deployment, including substantial computational overhead, memory footprint, and inference latency. While model pruning presents a viable solution to these challenges, existing unstructured pruning techniques often yield irregular sparsity patterns that necessitate specialized hardware or software support. In this work, we explore structured pruning, which eliminates entire architectural components and maintains compatibility with standard hardware accelerators. We introduce a novel structured pruning framework that leverages a hybrid multi-domain calibration set and an iterative calibration strategy to effectively identify and remove redundant channels. Extensive experiments on various models across diverse downstream tasks show that our approach achieves significant compression with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the emotional polarity expressed in textual data, typically categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. Hate speech detection, on the other hand, aims to recognize content that incites violence, discrimination, or hostility toward individuals or groups based on attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions. By combining state-of-the-art transformer architectures with explainability techniques, this work aims to improve both the effectiveness and transparency of multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection systems.

Conclusion: 该研究首次将综合语言错误分析与NER引导的对比学习相结合，证明通过针对性缓解策略可以在对抗QA中实现干净数据与对抗数据的性能接近一致，为提升问答系统的对抗鲁棒性提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems achieve impressive performance on standard benchmarks like SQuAD, but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. This project investigates the adversarial robustness of transformer models on the AddSent adversarial dataset through systematic experimentation across model scales and targeted mitigation strategies. We perform comprehensive multi-level error analysis using five complementary categorization schemes, identifying negation confusion and entity substitution as the primary failure modes. Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data. We implement three targeted mitigation strategies, with Entity-Aware contrastive learning achieving best performance: 89.89% AddSent Exact Match (EM) and 90.73% SQuAD EM, representing 94.9% closure of the adversarial gap. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating comprehensive linguistic error analysis with Named Entity Recognition (NER)-guided contrastive learning for adversarial QA, demonstrating that targeted mitigation can achieve near-parity between clean and adversarial performance.

Abstract: To address hallucination issues in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes a method for mitigating prompt-induced hallucinations. Building on a knowledge distillation chain-style model, we introduce a code module to guide knowledge-graph exploration and incorporate code as part of the chain-of-thought prompt, forming an external knowledge input that provides more accurate and structured information to the model. Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating code modules significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and effectively mitigates prompt-induced hallucinations. Specifically, HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 improve by 15.64%, 13.38%, and 13.28%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method achieves HIT@1, HIT@3, and HIT@5 scores exceeding 95% across several evaluation settings. These results indicate that the proposed approach substantially reduces hallucination behavior while improving the accuracy and verifiability of large language models.

<details>

Motivation: 语言是人类特有的能力，通过将序列组织成层次结构来高效传递信息。核心问题：为什么人类语言是层次化的？本研究旨在解释这一现象

Method: 建立似然函数量化语言处理机制中的平均单元数与人类工作记忆容量的对齐程度。通过计算模拟符号序列和对自然语言句子的验证分析，比较线性和分层处理的差异

Result: 相比线性处理，分层处理能更好地约束MLE值于人类工作记忆容量限制内，并随着序列/句子长度增加而表现更优。结果显示与儿童工作记忆发展相关的趋同模式

Conclusion: 构建层次结构通过优化顺序语言输入的处理效率同时保持在记忆约束内，真正解释了人类语言普遍的层次性质

Abstract: Language is a uniquely human trait, conveying information efficiently by organizing word sequences in sentences into hierarchical structures. A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强的LLMs方法无法有效处理长期智能体记忆的割裂性问题，存在'上下文隧道'问题，需要更符合认知科学原理的动态记忆机制。

Method: 提出Synapse统一记忆架构，基于认知科学的扩散激活理论构建动态记忆图，结合侧向抑制和时间衰减机制，并实现几何嵌入与基于激活的图遍历的三重混合检索策略。

Result: 在LoCoMo基准测试中，Synapse在复杂时序和多跳推理任务上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Synapse通过模拟人类记忆的动态关联特性，为长期记忆检索提供了鲁棒解决方案，代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generalized reasoning, standard retrieval-augmented approaches fail to address the disconnected nature of long-term agentic memory. To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference. We implement a Triple Hybrid Retrieval strategy that fuses geometric embeddings with activation-based graph traversal. Comprehensive evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark show that Synapse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in complex temporal and multi-hop reasoning tasks, offering a robust solution to the "Contextual Tunneling" problem. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: WBC攻击通过滑动窗口识别LLM训练数据中的局部记忆信号，相比传统基于全局平均损失的方法更有效，在多个数据集上显著提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的成员推理攻击大多依赖全局信号（如平均损失）来识别大语言模型的训练数据，但这种方法会稀释局部记忆信号，降低了攻击效果。作者挑战了这种全局平均范式，认为成员信号在局部上下文中更加明显

Method: 提出WBC（基于窗口的比较）方法，利用滑动窗口和基于符号的聚合。通过在不同大小的滑窗上进行损失比较，每个窗口基于目标模型和参考模型的损失比较对成员关系进行二分类投票，并通过几何间隔的窗口大小集成投票结果，从而捕捉从词元级痕迹到短语级结构的记忆模式

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，WBC显著优于现有基线方法，获得更高的AUC分数，并且在低误报率阈值下检测率提高了2-3倍

Conclusion: 聚合局部证据比全局平均更有效，暴露了微调大语言模型中的关键隐私漏洞。WBC为理解LLM记忆模式提供了新视角

Abstract: Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds. Our findings reveal that aggregating localized evidence is fundamentally more effective than global averaging, exposing critical privacy vulnerabilities in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in e-commerce applications to assist customer services in tasks such as product inquiries, recommendations, and order management. Existing benchmarks primarily evaluate whether these agents successfully complete the final task, overlooking the intermediate reasoning stages that are crucial for effective decision-making. To address this gap, we propose EComStage, a unified benchmark for evaluating agent-capable LLMs across the comprehensive stage-wise reasoning process: Perception (understanding user intent), Planning (formulating an action plan), and Action (executing the decision). EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation- specific strengths and weaknesses. Our results provide fine-grained, actionable insights for designing and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce settings.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training-free and label-free method for short text clustering that can be used on top of any existing embedder. In the context of customer-facing chatbots, companies are dealing with large amounts of user utterances that need to be clustered according to their intent. In these commercial settings, no labeled data is typically available, and the number of clusters is not known. Our method is based on iterative vector updating: it constructs sparse vectors based on representative texts, and then iteratively refines them through LLM guidance. Our method achieves comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art methods that use contrastive learning, but without assuming prior knowledge of clusters or labels. Experiments on diverse datasets and smaller LLMs show that our method is model agnostic and can be applied to any embedder, with relatively small LLMs, and different clustering methods. We also show that our method scales to large datasets, reducing the computational cost of the LLM. These low-resource, adaptable settings and the scalability of our method make it more aligned with real-world scenarios than existing clustering methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于标点符号感知的混合稀疏注意力机制（PHSA），通过利用标点符号作为语义边界锚点，在保持核心语义结构的同时降低计算复杂度，显著减少了长序列建模中的信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集注意力因二次复杂性难以处理长序列，而现有的稀疏注意力方法使用粗粒度的语义表示进行块选择，会模糊块内语义边界并导致关键信息丢失。因此需要一种能更精确识别语义边界的稀疏注意力机制。

Method: 提出基于标点符号感知的混合稀疏注意力（PHSA）：1）设计双分支聚合机制，融合全局语义表示和标点增强的边界特征；2）引入极端稀疏度自适应的训练和推理策略，稳定模型在低token激活率下的行为。

Result: 在通用基准和长上下文评估实验中，PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\%.

Conclusion: PHSA通过标点符号作为语义边界锚点，提供了一种高效且精确的稀疏注意力框架，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为长序列建模提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Attention serves as the fundamental mechanism for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs), yet dense attention becomes structurally prohibitive for long sequences due to its quadratic complexity. Consequently, sparse attention has received increasing attention as a scalable alternative. However, existing sparse attention methods rely on coarse-grained semantic representations during block selection, which blur intra-block semantic boundaries and lead to the loss of critical information. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{P}unctuation-aware \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{S}parse \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{(PHSA)}, a natively trainable sparse attention framework that leverages punctuation tokens as semantic boundary anchors. Specifically, (1) we design a dual-branch aggregation mechanism that fuses global semantic representations with punctuation-enhanced boundary features, preserving the core semantic structure while introducing almost no additional computational overhead; (2) we introduce an extreme-sparsity-adaptive training and inference strategy that stabilizes model behavior under very low token activation ratios; Extensive experiments on general benchmarks and long-context evaluations demonstrate that PHSA consistently outperforms dense attention and state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines, including InfLLM v2. Specifically, for the 0.6B-parameter model with 32k-token input sequences, PHSA can reduce the information loss by 10.8\% at a sparsity ratio of 97.3\%.

Abstract: Cultural backgrounds shape individuals' perspectives and approaches to problem-solving. Since the emergence of GPT-1 in 2018, large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid development. To date, the world's ten leading LLM developers are primarily based in China and the United States. To examine whether LLMs released by Chinese and U.S. developers exhibit cultural differences in Chinese-language settings, we evaluate their performance on questions about Chinese culture. This study adopts a direct-questioning paradigm to evaluate models such as GPT-5.1, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-Max, and Gemini2.5Pro. We assess their understanding of traditional Chinese culture, including history, literature, poetry, and related domains. Comparative analyses between LLMs developed in China and the U.S. indicate that Chinese models generally outperform their U.S. counterparts on these tasks. Among U.S.-developed models, Gemini 2.5Pro and GPT-5.1 achieve relatively higher accuracy. The observed performance differences may potentially arise from variations in training data distribution, localization strategies, and the degree of emphasis on Chinese cultural content during model development.

Abstract: Long-horizon conversational agents have to manage ever-growing interaction histories that quickly exceed the finite context windows of large language models (LLMs). Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S. Overall, TiMem treats temporal continuity as a first-class organizing principle for long-horizon memory in conversational agents.

Abstract: Socio-demographic prompting (SDP) - prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) using demographic proxies to generate culturally aligned outputs - often shows LLM responses as stereotypical and biased. While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP. Results show that models perform better with actual behaviors than simulated ones, contrary to what SDP suggests. However, performance with both behavior types diminishes and becomes nearly equal at the individual level, indicating limits to personalization.

Abstract: Subword tokenization introduces a computational layer in language models where many distinct token sequences decode to the same surface form and preserve meaning, yet induce different internal computations. Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of context length in large language models (LLMs) has outpaced existing evaluation benchmarks. Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the "thinking" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.

Conclusion: 大语言模型在文本压缩方面表现出色，特别是在文本主导领域；通过合适的配置，其在其他类型数据压缩上也能保持竞争力，但完全替代传统压缩算法仍面临挑战。

Abstract: In this report, we investigate the potential use of large language models (LLM's) in the task of data compression. Previous works have demonstrated promising results in applying LLM's towards compressing not only text, but also a wide range of multi-modal data. Despite the favorable performance achieved, there still remains several practical questions that pose a challenge towards replacing existing data compression algorithms with LLM's. In this work, we explore different methods to achieve a lower adjusted compression rate using LLM's as data compressors. In comparison to previous works, we were able to achieve a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) adjusted compression rate of around $18\%$ on the enwik9 dataset without additional model training. Furthermore, we explore the use of LLM's in compressing non-English data, code data, byte stream sequences. We show that while LLM's excel in compressing data in text-dominant domains, their ability in compressing non-natural text sequences still remain competitive if configured in the right way.

Abstract: Most modern computational approaches to lexical semantic change detection (LSC) rely on embedding-based distributional word representations with neural networks. Despite the strong performance on LSC benchmarks, they are often opaque. We investigate an alternative method which relies purely on dependency co-occurrence patterns of words. We demonstrate that it is effective for semantic change detection and even outperforms a number of distributional semantic models. We provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the predictions, showing that they are plausible and interpretable.

Abstract: Multilingual speech foundation models such as Whisper are trained on web-scale data, where data for each language consists of a myriad of regional varieties. However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has precipitated a profound paradigm shift in Artificial Intelligence, delivering monumental engineering successes that increasingly impact modern society. However, a critical paradox persists within the current field: despite the empirical efficacy, our theoretical understanding of LLMs remains disproportionately nascent, forcing these systems to be treated largely as ``black boxes''. To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence. By connecting empirical observations with rigorous scientific inquiry, this work provides a structured roadmap for transitioning LLM development from engineering heuristics toward a principled scientific discipline.

Abstract: Hallucination is a major concern in LLM-driven service systems, necessitating explicit knowledge grounding for compliance-guaranteed responses. In this paper, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Learning-to-Match (RAL2M), a novel framework that eliminates generation hallucination by repositioning LLMs as query-response matching judges within a retrieval-based system, providing a robust alternative to purely generative approaches. To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method effectively leverages the "wisdom of the crowd" and significantly outperforms strong baselines. Finally, we discuss best practices and promising directions for further exploiting latent representations in future work.

TL;DR: 通过知识图谱框架研究自回归大语言模型是否能学习关系语义逻辑，发现逻辑语义在足够监督下会涌现，反转失败主要由自回归顺序偏差而非语义缺陷导致


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究自回归LLMs是否能学习对称和逆关系等逻辑语义，以及反转失败是源于缺失关系语义还是左右顺序偏差

Method: 建立基于知识图谱的合成框架，生成对称/逆三元组文本，从头训练GPT风格的自回归模型，评估记忆、逻辑推理和上下文中对未见实体的泛化能力

Result: 发现了明显的阶段转变：在足够逻辑监督下关系语义涌现（即使浅层2-3层模型），成功泛化与稳定的中间层信号相关。顺序匹配的前向/反向测试和扩散基线表明反转失败主要由自回归顺序偏差而非逆序语义缺陷驱动

Conclusion: 自回归模型在有充分逻辑监督时可以学习关系语义，但顺序偏差会显著影响推理性能；中间层信号稳定与泛化能力相关，为理解LLMs的逻辑推理机制提供了新视角

Abstract: Autoregressive LLMs perform well on relational tasks that require linking entities via relational words (e.g., father/son, friend), but it is unclear whether they learn the logical semantics of such relations (e.g., symmetry and inversion logic) and, if so, whether reversal-type failures arise from missing relational semantics or left-to-right order bias. We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems often exhibit a perceived preference for high-resource languages, particularly English, resulting in the widespread adoption of English pivoting. While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel changepoint detection framework that combines ensemble statistical methods with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance both detection accuracy and the interpretability of regime changes in time series data. Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents. The open source Python framework demonstrates practical utility in diverse domains, including finance, political science, and environmental science, transforming raw statistical output into actionable insights for analysts and decision-makers.

Abstract: Bahnar, a minority language spoken across Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, faces significant preservation challenges due to limited research and data availability. This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%. This work contributes valuable resources for Bahnar language preservation and provides a framework applicable to other minority language digitization efforts.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved substantially through increased test-time computation, typically in the form of intermediate tokens known as chain-of-thought (CoT). However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\% for 8B models and 40\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\text{AUC}_{\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.

Abstract: Recent work in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) has enabled the identification and intervention of internal features in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a persistent challenge lies in linking such internal features to the reliable control of complex, behavior-level semantic attributes in language generation. In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs internalize deeply integrated representations of high-order concepts, and provide a novel, robust mechanistic path for the regulation of complex AI behaviors.

Motivation: 现有的个性化奖励建模方法主要依赖用户交互历史来调整模型判断与个人偏好对齐，但大多数方法将用户上下文视为静态或隐式条件信号，未能捕捉人类判断的动态性和多面性。

Method: P-Check框架训练一个即插即用的检查清单生成器，动态合成评估标准来指导奖励预测。引入偏好对比标准加权策略，根据标准在个性化判断中的区分能力为其分配显著性分数。

Conclusion: P-Check通过动态生成个性化评估检查清单，能够更好地捕捉用户偏好的细微差别，从而在奖励建模和生成任务中实现更好的个性化对齐。

Abstract: Recent approaches in personalized reward modeling have primarily focused on leveraging user interaction history to align model judgments with individual preferences. However, existing approaches largely treat user context as a static or implicit conditioning signal, failing to capture the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of human judgment. In this paper, we propose P-Check, a novel personalized reward modeling framework, designed to train a plug-and-play checklist generator that synthesizes dynamic evaluation criteria for guiding the reward prediction. To better align these checklists with personalized nuances, we introduce Preference-Contrastive Criterion Weighting, a training strategy that assigns saliency scores to criteria based on their discriminative power for personalized judgment. We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that P-Check not only improves reward accuracy but also enhances downstream personalized generation, and remains robust in OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite strong performance on complex mathematical problems, exhibit systematic limitations in counting tasks. This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a key paradigm for reducing factual hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), yet little is known about how the order of retrieved documents affects model behavior. We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在数学推理任务上的优异表现常归因于其生成显式思维链的能力，但先前研究发现模型在完成完整推理文本前就能给出正确答案，这表明存在潜在的内部非言语计算。这种现象在英语中已有研究，但在多语言环境中的特性尚不清楚。

Method: 采用截断策略让模型仅基于部分推理痕迹生成答案，逐步测量潜在预测的形成过程；通过表征分析探究不同语言间内部机制的差异。

Result: 发现明确的多语言潜在推理证据，但在资源丰富语言中表现较强，在低资源语言中较弱，在困难基准上更不明显；尽管表面存在差异，但预测的内部演化跨语言高度一致，并与英语模式基本对齐。

Conclusion: 多语言潜在推理普遍存在但不均衡，不同语言间共享一个以英语为中心的潜在推理通路，表明大型推理模型在多语言环境中的内部推理机制具有深层的统一性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks, often attributed to their capability to generate explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.

Abstract: Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively supports single-hop question answering with large language models but faces significant limitations in multi-hop question answering tasks, which require combining evidence from multiple documents. Existing chunk-based retrieval often provides irrelevant and logically incoherent context, leading to incomplete evidence chains and incorrect reasoning during answer generation. To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges. During online retrieval, SentGraph performs graph-guided evidence selection and path expansion to retrieve fine-grained sentence-level evidence. Extensive experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SentGraph, validating the importance of explicitly modeling sentence-level logical dependencies for multi-hop reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into formal statements to enable machine reasoning, faces fundamental challenges in the wild due to the multimodal nature of the physical world, where physics requires inferring hidden constraints (e.g., mass or energy) from visual elements. To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on clinical text understanding, they struggle with longitudinal prediction tasks such as dementia prognosis, which require reasoning over complex, non-monotonic symptom trajectories across multiple visits. Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets. Notably, on the ADNI benchmark, our 7B model rivals GPT-4o, effectively capturing fluctuating cognitive trajectories. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dementiar1-CDB5

Abstract: Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages. We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput. Among the evaluated models, Krutrim-2 achieves the strongest performance, obtaining a semantic score of 76.1 with full context. While, in shortened context settings it scores 74.9 with answer paragraph selection and 71.4 with vector-based retrieval. Qualitative evaluations further corroborate these findings.

Abstract: Preference alignment methods such as RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) improve instruction following, but they can also reinforce hallucinations when preference judgments reward fluency and confidence over factual correctness. We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531). F-DPO requires no auxiliary reward model, token-level annotations, or multi-stage training.

Abstract: Reliable confidence is essential for trusting the outputs of LLMs, yet widely deployed post-trained LLMs (PoLLMs) typically compromise this trust with severe overconfidence. In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications. Experiments across five datasets and three LLM families demonstrate the effectiveness of BaseCal, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90\% compared to the best unsupervised baselines.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型解码阶段使用稀疏注意力会因信息丢失而导致序列变长，造成“越少越少”现象。为此提出了早期停止算法，能在准确率损失小于2%的情况下减少高达90%的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理效率需求迫切，解码阶段占主导延迟。现有稀疏注意力方法旨在降低解码复杂度，但研究发现这会因信息丢失导致序列变长，反而增加端到端复杂度。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析稀疏注意力的“越少越少”现象，提出基于信息增益阈值的早期停止算法，在稀疏解码过程中检测信息损失超过信息增益的临界点并及时停止。

Result: 早期停止算法在推理密集型基准测试中，可减少高达90%的token消耗，准确率损失控制在2%以内。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力虽能降低每token计算复杂度，但会因信息丢失导致序列增长。提出的早期停止算法有效解决了这一悖论，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities across a wide range of complex tasks and are increasingly deployed at scale, placing significant demands on inference efficiency. Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding. Our early-stopping algorithm reduces token consumption by up to 90% with a marginal accuracy degradation of less than 2% across reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于语义层内部推理图的忠实性幻觉检测方法，在RAGTruth和Dolly-15k数据集上超越现有基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统虽然能减少事实性幻觉，但忠实性幻觉依然存在。现有检测方法要么忽略模型内部推理过程，要么对相关特征处理粗糙，导致判别器难以有效学习

Method: 1. 将层级相关性传播算法从token层扩展到语义层，基于归因向量构建内部推理图，提供更忠实的语义依赖表示。2. 设计基于小型预训练语言模型的通用框架，利用LLM推理中的依赖关系进行训练和幻觉检测，通过阈值动态调整正确样本的通过率

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在RAGTruth和Dolly-15k数据集上相比最先进基准取得了更好的整体性能

Conclusion: 提出的语义层内部推理图方法能有效检测RAG系统中的忠实性幻觉，通过更精细的内部推理建模提高了检测性能

Abstract: The Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system based on Large language model (LLM) has made significant progress. It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better overall performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on RAGTruth and Dolly-15k.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种贪心剪枝方法，用于压缩语言模型的推理链同时保持模型似然性，并通过蒸馏框架验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通过生成长推理链解决复杂任务，但带来了计算成本增加和难以隔离功能相关推理的问题。之前的工作通过概率采样、启发式方法或前沿模型监督来压缩推理链，但未能深入探究模型是否内部编码了token级别的功能重要性。

Method: 提出贪心剪枝方法，这是一种保留似然性的删除过程，迭代地移除那些在特定目标下对模型似然性影响最小的推理token，从而得到长度受控的推理链。

Result: 在蒸馏框架中评估剪枝后的推理链，发现使用这些链训练的学生模型在相同推理长度下优于基于前沿模型监督的压缩基线。分析还显示系统性的剪枝模式，注意力分数可以预测贪心剪枝的排名，表明模型在推理token上编码了非平凡的功能重要性结构。

Conclusion: 贪心剪枝方法能够有效压缩推理链同时保持模型的性能，证明了语言模型内部确实编码了token级别的功能重要性结构，为理解模型推理机制提供了新的诊断视角。

Abstract: Large language models solve complex tasks by generating long reasoning chains, achieving higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational cost and reduced ability to isolate functionally relevant reasoning. Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths. Finally, our analysis reveals systematic pruning patterns and shows that attention scores can predict greedy pruning ranks, further suggesting that models encode a nontrivial functional importance structure over reasoning tokens.

Abstract: Moral sensitivity is fundamental to human moral competence, as it guides individuals in regulating everyday behavior. Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging. In this paper, we take a step toward answering the question: how can we enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs? Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our pragmatic methods can enhance moral sensitivity in LLMs and achieves strong performance on representative morality-relevant benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency and faithfulness. Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications. Additionally, we introduce two faithfulneses metrics $π$-Soft-NC and $π$-Soft-NS, which are modifications of Soft-NC/NS that provide fairer comparisons by controlling the amount of information kept when perturbing the text. We evaluate Grad-ELLM on sentiment classification, question answering, and open-generation tasks using different models. Experiment results show that Grad-ELLM consistently achieves superior faithfulness than other attribution methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于幽默偏好存在广泛的个体和文化差异，用大型语言模型评估幽默效果面临较大挑战；本研究旨在通过分析日本Oogiri创意应答游戏中的用户投票数据，建立幽默偏好异质性模型，并探索LLMs能否模拟特定用户群的幽默判断模式。

Method: 使用Oogiri游戏的用户投票记录进行聚类分析，采用Bradley-Terry-Luce模型估计每个聚类的可解释偏好因子权重；通过提示LLMs选择更幽默的应答来获取其偏好判断，并尝试通过角色提示引导LLMs的偏好。

Result: 用户聚类显示出明显的差异化的偏好模式，LLMs的幽默判断结果与某些用户群的偏好相似；通过角色提示可以有效引导LLMs的偏好朝着特定用户群的方向偏移。

Conclusion: 研究验证了建模幽默偏好异质性的可行性，并展示了LLMs能够模拟和定向调节其幽默判断模式，这为个性化幽默评估工具的开发提供了方法论支持；研究数据和脚本将公开发布以支持可重复性。

Abstract: Humor preferences vary widely across individuals and cultures, complicating the evaluation of humor using large language models (LLMs). In this study, we model heterogeneity in humor preferences in Oogiri, a Japanese creative response game, by clustering users with voting logs and estimating cluster-specific weights over interpretable preference factors using Bradley-Terry-Luce models. We elicit preference judgments from LLMs by prompting them to select the funnier response and found that user clusters exhibit distinct preference patterns and that the LLM results can resemble those of particular clusters. Finally, we demonstrate that, by persona prompting, LLM preferences can be directed toward a specific cluster. The scripts for data collection and analysis will be released to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Emotion is a central dimension of spoken communication, yet, we still lack a mechanistic account of how modern large audio-language models (LALMs) encode it internally. We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors.

Motivation: 毒性数据的可控、类别特定增强对提升毒性分类的鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法面临监督有限和分布偏差的挑战

Method: 提出两阶段定向训练策略，利用LLM生成的中立文本作为语义锚点，动态选择中立样本提供平衡指导，毒性样本显式优化以与中立样本形成类间对比

Result: 在四个仇恨言论基准测试中，ToxiGAN在macro-F1和hate-F1指标上均取得最佳平均性能，优于传统和基于LLM的增强方法

Conclusion: 语义锚点和定向训练策略有效增强了分类器鲁棒性，为毒性数据增强提供了新思路

Abstract: Augmenting toxic language data in a controllable and class-specific manner is crucial for improving robustness in toxicity classification, yet remains challenging due to limited supervision and distributional skew. We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance. Toxic samples are explicitly optimized to diverge from these exemplars, reinforcing class-specific contrastive signals. Experiments on four hate speech benchmarks show that ToxiGAN achieves the strongest average performance in both macro-F1 and hate-F1, consistently outperforming traditional and LLM-based augmentation methods. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further confirm the benefits of semantic ballast and directional training in enhancing classifier robustness.

Abstract: Low-resource indigenous languages often lack the parallel corpora required for effective neural machine translation (NMT). Synthetic data generation offers a practical strategy for mitigating this limitation in data-scarce settings. In this work, we augment curated parallel datasets for indigenous languages of the Americas with synthetic sentence pairs generated using a high-capacity multilingual translation model. We fine-tune a multilingual mBART model on curated-only and synthetically augmented data and evaluate translation quality using chrF++, the primary metric used in recent AmericasNLP shared tasks for agglutinative languages.
  We further apply language-specific preprocessing, including orthographic normalization and noise-aware filtering, to reduce corpus artifacts. Experiments on Guarani--Spanish and Quechua--Spanish translation show consistent chrF++ improvements from synthetic data augmentation, while diagnostic experiments on Aymara highlight the limitations of generic preprocessing for highly agglutinative languages.

Method: 对多个广泛使用的VLA数据集进行系统审计，从词汇多样性、重复与重叠度、语义相似性和句法复杂性等多维度量化指令语言特征。

Result: 分析表明许多数据集依赖高度重复、模板化的命令，结构变化有限，呈现出指令形式的窄分布。这些数据集的语言信号覆盖范围有限。

Abstract: Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儘管大型語言模型（LLM）進展迅速，但在高度專業化、結構化的考試（如日本律師考試）中可靠表現仍是一大挑戰。考試不僅需要高階法律推理，還需嚴格遵守複雜答題格式及多重命題聯合評估。儘管最近研究採用分解問題為簡單真偽判斷的方式有所改進，但這些方法未在原始考試格式及評分規則下系統評估，未能證明其真正具備考試水準的能力。

Method: 基於新構建的忠實複刻考試真實格式及評分尺度的資料集，訓練一個自驗證模型。模型能接受原始問題結構及評分規則的評估，經比較多智能體推論、分解式監督等替代策略後，模型在實際考試尺度上超越合格分數。

Result: 在實際考試尺度上，該模型能超越官方合格分數，這是首次有LLM在不改動原題結構或評分規則下通過日本律師考試。與多智能體推論、分解式監督等其他策略相比，該模型表現最佳，凸顯了格式忠實監督及一致性驗證的重要性。

Conclusion: 精心設計的單一模型方法能在高風險專業推理任務中勝過更複雜的系統。結果強調了格式忠實監督與一致性驗證的重要性，並顯示單模型在專業考試中的潛力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on highly professional and structured examinations remains a significant challenge. The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules. We further conduct extensive comparisons with alternative strategies, including multi-agent inference and decomposition-based supervision, and find that these methods fail to achieve comparable performance. Our results highlight the importance of format-faithful supervision and consistency verification, and suggest that carefully designed single-model approaches can outperform more complex systems in high-stakes professional reasoning tasks. Our dataset and codes are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管长链推理CoT在单一答案任务中表现出色，但其在建模需要捕捉概率模糊性的人类标签变化任务上的能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 通过对基于分布的任务进行系统的解耦实验，采用跨CoT实验来隔离推理文本的影响，并分析不同因素对任务表现的贡献度。

Result: 长CoT能改善分布对齐，但最终准确率由CoT内容主导（99%方差贡献），而分布排序则由模型先验主导（超过80%）；CoT对准确率的影响在推理过程中单调增长，但分布结构主要由LLM内在先验决定。

Conclusion: 长CoT主要作为LLM对最佳选项的决策工具，但在模糊任务的精细分布校准方面功能不足。

Abstract: Reasoning-tuned LLMs utilizing long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) excel at single-answer tasks, yet their ability to model Human Label Variation--which requires capturing probabilistic ambiguity rather than resolving it--remains underexplored. We investigate this through systematic disentanglement experiments on distribution-based tasks, employing Cross-CoT experiments to isolate the effect of reasoning text from intrinsic model priors. We observe a distinct "decoupled mechanism": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors. These findings suggest that long CoT serves as a decisive LLM decision-maker for the top option but fails to function as a granular distribution calibrator for ambiguous tasks.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的LLM智能体在web信息搜索中存在长期规划瓶颈，研究发现存在“计划锚定”现象——首个推理步骤对后续行为产生不成比例的重大影响，而现有RL方法因均匀分配奖励而无法有效处理此问题

Method: 提出Anchor-GRPO两阶段框架：第一阶段通过自博弈经验和人工校准的细粒度评估标准优化智能体的初始规划步骤；第二阶段通过稀疏奖励机制将执行过程与初始规划对齐，确保工具使用的稳定性与效率

Result: 在BrowseComp、BrowseComp-Zh、GAIA和XBench-DeepSearch四个基准测试中，从3B到30B的不同规模模型上Anchor-GRPO均优于基线GRPO和First-step GRPO，显著提升任务成功率和工具效率。WebAnchor-30B在BrowseComp达到46.0% pass@1，在GAIA达到76.4%

Conclusion: Anchor-GRPO通过识别并显式优化计划锚定现象，有效解决了长规划web推理任务中的瓶颈问题，展现出良好的可扩展性——随着模型规模和上下文长度增加获得更高准确率

Abstract: Large Language Model(LLM)-based agents have shown strong capabilities in web information seeking, with reinforcement learning (RL) becoming a key optimization paradigm. However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($ρ= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($ρ\approx 0.1$). Critically, correlation signs reverse when pooling across models (Simpson's Paradox), so practitioners must validate per-model. Embedding metrics achieve comparable predictive power to URIEL linguistic typology. Our results provide concrete guidance for source language selection and highlight the importance of model-specific analysis.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to forget sensitive knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining general utility. However, existing approaches typically treat all tokens in a response indiscriminately and enforce uncertainty over the entire vocabulary. This global treatment results in unnecessary utility degradation and extends optimization to content-agnostic regions. To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance. Extensive experiments validate that PALU achieves superior forgetting efficacy and utility preservation compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: The hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to master new skills through Constructive Episodic Simulation-retrieving past experiences to synthesize solutions for novel tasks. While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency. By focusing on under-resourced languages, our work advances hate speech detection across diverse linguistic contexts. Our dataset includes token-level rationale annotations for 6,004 Hindi, 4,492 Telugu, and 6,334 English samples. Data and code are available on https://github.com/ziarehman30/X-MuTeST

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have shown strong potential for general natural language tasks with in-context examples. However, due to the bidirectional attention mechanism, DLMs incur substantial computational cost as context length increases. This work addresses this issue with a key discovery: unlike the sequential generation in autoregressive language models (ARLMs), the diffusion generation paradigm in DLMs allows \textit{efficient dynamic adjustment of the context} during generation. Building on this insight, we propose \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{I}n-Context \textbf{P}lanner (DIP), a context-optimization method that dynamically selects and inserts in-context examples during generation, rather than providing all examples in the prompt upfront. Results show DIP maintains generation quality while achieving up to 12.9$\times$ inference speedup over standard inference and 1.17$\times$ over KV cache-enhanced inference.

TL;DR: UltraLogic框架通过基于代码的求解方法，自动生成高质量、难度分级的大规模推理数据，以克服LLMs在复杂多步逻辑推理方面的瓶颈，并引入BFR奖励机制提升训练效率。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在需要多步逻辑、规划和验证的复杂通用推理方面仍有瓶颈，且缺乏大规模、高质量、难度校准的数据，Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards虽在特定领域有效，但通用推理数据不足。

Method: 提出UltraLogic框架：1) 通过基于代码的求解方法将问题逻辑核心与自然语言表达解耦，自动化生成高质量数据；2) 包含数百个独特任务类型和跨越十个难度级别的自动校准流程；3) 引入双极浮动奖励机制，使用分级惩罚来区分完美回答和有逻辑缺陷的回答，避免二值奖励稀疏性和非负奖励陷阱。

Result: 实验表明任务多样性是推理能力提升的主要驱动力，双极浮动奖励与难度匹配策略结合能显著提高训练效率，引导模型达到全局逻辑最优。

Conclusion: UltraLogic框架通过自动化生成高质量、难度分级的推理数据，结合创新的奖励机制，有效提升了大型语言模型的复杂通用推理能力。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language processing , complex general-purpose reasoning requiring multi-step logic, planning, and verification remains a critical bottleneck. Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.

Abstract: Student mistakes in mathematics are often systematic: a learner applies a coherent but wrong procedure and repeats it across contexts. We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%. We release MalruleLib as infrastructure for educational AI that models student procedures across contexts, enabling diagnosis and feedback that targets the underlying misconception.

TL;DR: 创建了RXL-RADSet多RADS基准数据集，比较了开源SLM与GPT-5.2在RADS分配任务中的表现，发现大规模SLM（20-32B）在引导提示下接近专有模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的报告和数据系统（RADS）标准化了放射学风险沟通，但自动化分配面临指南复杂性、输出格式限制和跨框架基准不足的挑战，需要创建标准化基准来评估不同模型

Method: 构建了包含1,600份合成放射报告的RXL-RADSet数据集，涵盖10种RADS标准和多种模态。使用场景计划和模拟放射科医生风格生成报告，经过两阶段放射科医生验证。评估了41个量化SLM（12个家族，0.135-32B参数）和GPT-5.2的引导提示性能

Result: GPT-5.2在引导提示下达到99.8%有效性和81.1%准确率。SLM总体达到96.8%有效性和61.1%准确率；20-32B规模的顶尖SLM达到约99%有效性和70%以上准确率。性能随模型规模提升（拐点在<1B和>=10B之间），因分类难度而非无效输出导致复杂RADS性能下降。引导提示相比零样本提示提升性能

Conclusion: RXL-RADSet提供了放射科医生验证的多RADS基准；大型SLM（20-32B）在引导提示下能够接近专有模型性能，但在高复杂度方案上仍存在差距

Abstract: Background: Reporting and Data Systems (RADS) standardize radiology risk communication but automated RADS assignment from narrative reports is challenging because of guideline complexity, output-format constraints, and limited benchmarking across RADS frameworks and model sizes. Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Spatio-temporal reasoning in time series involves the explicit synthesis of temporal dynamics, spatial dependencies, and textual context. This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.

Abstract: The field of emergent communication within multi-agent systems examines how autonomous agents can independently develop communication strategies, without explicit programming, and adapt them to varied environments. However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.

Abstract: Avatar embodiment experiences have the potential to enhance human capabilities by extending human senses, body, and mind. This study investigates social acceptance of robotic and virtual avatars as enablers of capability enhancement in six domains: identity exploration, well-being and behavioral transformation, expanded travel capabilities, expanded bodily and sensory abilities, cognitive augmentation, and immortality. We conducted a large-scale survey (n = 1001) in Dubai to explore acceptance of sixteen capability enhancement scenarios within these domains. The highest levels of agreement were observed for multilingual communication (77.5%) and learning capabilities (68.7%), followed by assisting individuals with reduced mobility (64.5%) and behavioral transformation (59.5%). Scenarios involving immortality through consciousness transfer received the least support (34.9%). These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of public attitudes toward avatar-based human enhancement and offer practical guidance for the responsible design, development, and integration of cybernetic avatars in the society, ensuring their societal acceptance and fostering a harmonious human-avatar coexistence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管厂商宣称视频透视技术能够实现感知真实性，但尚不清楚这些系统在不同环境条件下复制自然人类视觉的程度。需要量化VST头显与人眼之间的感知差距。

Method: 使用视觉敏锐度、对比敏感度和色觉的心理物理学测量方法，量化对比了苹果Vision Pro、Meta Quest 3和Quest Pro等主流VST头显与人眼的视觉性能差异。

Result: 所有测试的VST系统都无法匹配裸眼的动态范围性和适应性。高端设备在理想光照条件下接近人类表现，但在低光条件下（特别是对比敏感度和敏锐度）表现出显著退化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字现实重建的生理限制，确立了具体的感知差距，为未来实现难以区分的VST体验提供了技术路线图。

Abstract: Video see-through (VST) technology aims to seamlessly blend virtual and physical worlds by reconstructing reality through cameras. While manufacturers promise perceptual fidelity, it remains unclear how close these systems are to replicating natural human vision across varying environmental conditions. In this work, we quantify the perceptual gap between the human eye and different popular VST headsets (Apple Vision Pro, Meta Quest 3, Quest Pro) using psychophysical measures of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color vision. We show that despite hardware advancements, all tested VST systems fail to match the dynamic range and adaptability of the naked eye. While high-end devices approach human performance in ideal lighting, they exhibit significant degradation in low-light conditions, particularly in contrast sensitivity and acuity. Our results map the physiological limitations of digital reality reconstruction, establishing a specific perceptual gap that defines the roadmap for achieving indistinguishable VST experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展现实(XR)正发展为通用计算平台，但视觉疲劳和模拟器眩晕阻碍了其在生产力场景中的应用。虽然这些症状通常归因于延迟或运动冲突，但文本清晰度对生理舒适度的具体影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过在统一的logMAR尺度上系统操控端到端的有效分辨率，在虚拟现实和视频透视环境中进行受控的受试者内研究，测量阅读心理物理学表现和眩晕症状。

Result: 研究发现阅读性能和用户舒适度随分辨率下降呈指数级恶化，0 logMAR是关键生理转折点：优于此阈值的分辨率可带来裸眼水平的性能且眩晕最小化，而差于此阈值的分辨率会引发恶心和眼球运动负担的快速非线性增加。

Conclusion: 解析模糊文本所需的认知和感知努力直接损害用户舒适度，人类眼睛分辨率为未来人机工程学XR系统设计建立了关键基准线。

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) is evolving into a general-purpose computing platform, yet its adoption for productivity is hindered by visual fatigue and simulator sickness. While these symptoms are often attributed to latency or motion conflicts, the precise impact of textual clarity on physiological comfort remains undefined. Here we show that sub-optimal effective resolution, the clarity that reaches the eye after the full display-optics-rendering pipeline, is a primary driver of simulator sickness during reading tasks in both virtual reality and video see-through environments. By systematically manipulating end-to-end effective resolution on a unified logMAR scale, we measured reading psychophysics and sickness symptoms in a controlled within-subjects study. We find that reading performance and user comfort degrade exponentially as resolution drops below 0 logMAR (normal visual acuity). Notably, our results reveal 0 logMAR as a key physiological tipping point: resolutions better than this threshold yield naked-eye-level performance with minimal sickness, whereas poorer resolutions trigger rapid, non-linear increases in nausea and oculomotor strain. These findings suggest that the cognitive and perceptual effort required to resolve blurry text directly compromises user comfort, establishing human-eye resolution as a critical baseline for the design of future ergonomic XR systems.

Abstract: Autonomous driving improves traffic efficiency but presents safety challenges in complex port environments. This study investigates how environmental factors, traffic factors, and pedestrian characteristics influence interaction safety between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians in ports. Using virtual reality (VR) simulations of typical port scenarios, 33 participants completed pedestrian crossing tasks under varying visibility, vehicle sizes, and time pressure conditions. Results indicate that low-visibility conditions, partial occlusions and larger vehicle sizes significantly increase perceived risk, prompting pedestrians to wait longer and accept larger gaps. Specifically, pedestrians tended to accept larger gaps and waited longer when interacting with large autonomous truck platoons, reflecting heightened caution due to their perceived threat. However, local obstructions also reduce post-encroachment time, compressing safety margins. Individual attributes such as age, gender, and driving experience further shape decision-making, while time pressure undermines compensatory behaviors and increases risk. Based on these findings, safety strategies are proposed, including installing wide-angle cameras at multiple viewpoints, enabling real-time vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing port lighting and signage, and strengthening pedestrian safety training. This study offers practical recommendations for improving the safety and deployment of vision-based autonomous systems in port settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂的多车道无信号交叉口环境中，外部人机界面（eHMI）对行人过街行为的干扰潜力尚未得到充分探索。研究旨在考察不同类型 eHMI 如何影响行人的认知负荷、注意力分配和过街行为，尤其是在涉及多辆自动驾驶车辆的复杂场景中。

Method: 采用基于虚拟现实的实验方法，考察 allocentric 和 egocentric 两种类型的 eHMI 显示在自动驾驶车辆上时，行人在多车道环境中的过街行为，重点关注行人在过街过程中的注视模式。

Result: eHMI 的存在显著增加了行人的认知负荷和分心可能性，在多车道多车辆场景中甚至可能误导行人。allocentric eHMI 比 egocentric eHMI 导致更高的认知负荷和更严重的注意力分散，这表现为对交互车辆的 eHMI 注视时间更长、注意力比例更高，以及对非交互车道车辆的注视分布更广。误导行为主要由非交互车道让行车辆的 eHMI 信号触发，在这种不对称信号配置下，egocentric eHMI 导致的误判率更高。

Conclusion: 研究强调了增强 eHMI 设计的重要性，需要平衡不同视角下显示信息的清晰度和一致性，特别是在复杂的多车道交通场景中。这些发现为未来自动驾驶车辆 eHMI 系统的应用和标准化提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Appropriate communication is crucial for efficient and safe interactions between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). External human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on AVs, which can be categorized as allocentric or egocentric, are considered a promising solution. While the effectiveness of eHMIs has been extensively studied, in complex environments, such as unsignalized multi-lane streets, their potential to interfere with pedestrian crossing behavior remains underexplored. Hence, a virtual reality-based experiment was conducted to examine how different types of eHMIs displayed on AVs affect the crossing behavior of pedestrians in multi-lane streets environments, with a focus on the gaze patterns of pedestrians during crossing. The results revealed that the presence of eHMIs significantly influenced the cognitive load on pedestrians and increased the possibility of distraction, even misleading pedestrians in cases involving multiple AVs on multi-lane streets. Notably, allocentric eHMIs induced higher cognitive loads and greater distraction in pedestrians than egocentric eHMIs. This was primarily evidenced by longer gaze time and higher proportions of attention for the eHMI on the interacting vehicle, as well as a broader distribution of gaze toward vehicles in the non-interacting lane. However, misleading behavior was mainly triggered by eHMI signals from yielding vehicles in the non-interacting lane. Under such asymmetric signal configurations, egocentric eHMIs resulted in a higher misjudgment rate than allocentric eHMIs. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing eHMI designs to balance the clarity and consistency of the displayed information across different perspectives, especially in complex multi-lane traffic scenarios. This study provides valuable insights regarding the application and standardization of future eHMI systems for AVs.

*H. Van Dyke Parunak*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ASSIST是一种基于蚁群优化思想的近似最大部分子图同构算法，通过节点配对比对和信息素更新的启发式搜索，在多项式时间内找到查询图在数据图中的近似最大匹配子图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最大部分子图同构问题是NP完全问题，目前最快的启发式算法复杂度为O(d²)。现有的方法在处理带标签节点图匹配时，难以应对时间顺序边、不精确匹配以及数据图中节点/边缺失等复杂场景，需要更高效且灵活的解决方案。

Method: ASSIST算法受蚁群优化启发，包含两个阶段：1）节点配对比对阶段，复杂度为O(q·log(d))，识别查询图和数据图中可能的匹配节点对；2）迭代子图搜索阶段，这是组合复杂度最高的部分，但算法通过启发式搜索实现了与查询图大小线性、与数据图大小无关的时间复杂度。算法通过信息素更新等机制引导搜索过程。

Result: ASSIST算法将组合复杂的子图搜索部分的时间复杂度降低到与查询图大小线性相关，而与数据图大小无关，显著提升了大规模图匹配的效率。算法还能扩展支持时间顺序边、不精确匹配和缺失节点/边等复杂匹配场景。

Conclusion: ASSIST算法提供了一种高效、灵活的近似最大部分子图同构解决方案，在多项式时间内处理大规模图匹配问题，并能适应多种复杂匹配需求，相比现有启发式算法在时间和灵活性方面都具有优势。

Abstract: Maximum partial subgraph isomorphism compares two graphs (nodes joined by edges) to find a largest common subgraph. A common use case, for graphs with labeled nodes, seeks to find instances of a \textit{query} graph with $q$ nodes in a (typically larger) \textit{data} graph with $d$ nodes. The problem is NP-complete, and naïve solutions are exponential in $q + d$. The fastest current heuristic has complexity $O(d^2)$. This paper outlines ASSIST (Approximate Swarming Subgraph Isomorphism through Stigmergy), inspired by the ant colony optimization approach to the traveling salesperson. After peering (identifying matching individual nodes in query and data) in time $O(q\cdot log(d))$, the time required for ASSIST's iterative subgraph search, the combinatorially complex part of the problem, is linear in query size and constant in data size. ASSIST can be extended to support matching problems (such as temporally ordered edges, inexact matches, and missing nodes or edges in the data graph) that frustrate other heuristics.

Abstract: Understanding a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy is crucial for ensuring that autonomous agents behave according to human expectations. This goal can be achieved using Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) techniques. Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.

Abstract: To support reliable long-term interaction in complex environments, LLM agents require memory systems that efficiently manage historical experiences. Existing approaches either retain full interaction histories via passive context extension, leading to substantial redundancy, or rely on iterative reasoning to filter noise, incurring high token costs. To address this challenge, we introduce SimpleMem, an efficient memory framework based on semantic lossless compression. We propose a three-stage pipeline designed to maximize information density and token utilization: (1) \textit{Semantic Structured Compression}, which applies entropy-aware filtering to distill unstructured interactions into compact, multi-view indexed memory units; (2) \textit{Recursive Memory Consolidation}, an asynchronous process that integrates related units into higher-level abstract representations to reduce redundancy; and (3) \textit{Adaptive Query-Aware Retrieval}, which dynamically adjusts retrieval scope based on query complexity to construct precise context efficiently. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and inference cost, achieving an average F1 improvement of 26.4% while reducing inference-time token consumption by up to 30-fold, demonstrating a superior balance between performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.

TL;DR: 本研究通过大量实验探讨了在设备上部署AI模型时的CPU利用率和散热条件等实际影响因素，并重点关注了模型选择、资源消耗以及领域适应能力这两大关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在设备上部署AI模型具有高效性，但目前研究对其实际部署所需的设备CPU利用率和散热条件等关键考量因素较少关注。本研究旨在通过实验探讨在设备AI模型的资源消耗和领域适应能力，以便为真实世界的服务部署提供有益的经验指南。

Method: 本文以直播聊天消息翻译任务为例，构建了名为LiveChatBench的包含1,000个韩英平行句对基准测试集。在五种移动设备上进行了广泛实验，研究了不同设备的资源消耗、散热条件以及模型选择对性能的影响。

Conclusion: 本文的研究结果为在设备AI社区的实践部署提供了有意义的指导，强调了在资源受限环境中部署AI模型时需综合考虑设备性能、散热条件和领域适应能力等多方面因素，同时也展示了在设备模型在某些任务上可达到与云端商用模型相媲美的性能潜力。

Abstract: Despite its efficiency, there has been little research on the practical aspects required for real-world deployment of on-device AI models, such as the device's CPU utilization and thermal conditions. In this paper, through extensive experiments, we investigate two key issues that must be addressed to deploy on-device models in real-world services: (i) the selection of on-device models and the resource consumption of each model, and (ii) the capability and potential of on-device models for domain adaptation. To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs. Experiments on five mobile devices demonstrate that, although serving a large and heterogeneous user base requires careful consideration of highly constrained deployment settings and model selection, the proposed approach nevertheless achieves performance comparable to commercial models such as GPT-5.1 on the well-targeted task. We expect that our findings will provide meaningful insights to the on-device AI community.

*Mehmet Kurmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究对话式智能体在查询结构化数据库时如何处理查询约束不完整（不明确）和无法满足（查询结果为空）的问题，提出基于偏好感知的查询修复方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话式智能体在面对查询问题时常出现两种相关联的故障：不明确性（缺少精确查询的必要约束）和不可行性（所有约束条件导致查询结果为空）。传统方法要么直接返回"无结果"，要么采用临时规则放宽约束，但这些方法可能违背用户意图，尤其是忽略用户最关心的重要约束。

Method: 作者将不可行性处理视为偏好感知的查询修复问题，主张当查询无法满足时，智能体应该放宽用户认为最不重要的约束。提出了三种基于大语言模型的约束重要性推断方法：（1）局部加权，（2）全局单次加权，以及（3）成对排序。此外，还引入了评估基准AWARE-US，包含基于人设的查询任务，要求智能体通过对话澄清需求，并按照人设隐含偏好解决不可行性问题。

Result: 实验表明，局部加权方法在偏好对齐方面表现最佳，而全局加权方法在正确放松约束方面最优。

Conclusion: 为解决对话式智能体查询数据库时的不明确性和不可行性问题，基于用户偏好的查询修复方法能够有效识别和放松最不重要的约束，显著改善查询结果质量和用户体验。提出的AWARE-US基准为未来研究提供了评估平台。

Abstract: Tool-calling conversational agents querying structured databases often face two linked failures: underspecification (missing constraints needed to run a precise query) and infeasibility (the fully specified query returns an empty set because no item satisfies all constraints). Existing work often responds with "no results" or relaxes constraints using ad hoc rules, which can violate user intent by discarding requirements the user cares about most. We frame infeasibility handling as a preference-aware query repair problem: when a query is unsatisfiable, the agent should relax the least important constraints to the user. We propose three LLM-based methods for inferring relative constraint importance from dialogue: (1) local weighting, (2) global one-shot weighting, and (3) pairwise ranking. Experiments show local weighting achieves the best preference alignment, while global weighting performs best on correct constraint relaxation. We also introduce AWARE-US, a benchmark of persona-grounded queries requiring agents to disambiguate requests via conversation and resolve infeasibility in a way consistent with persona-implied preferences.

Motivation: LLM智能体在长时程任务中常因上下文无限增长和错误积累而失效，现有解决方案如上下文压缩或检索增强提示在信息保真度与推理稳定性之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出了InfiAgent框架，通过将持久状态外部化到文件中心状态抽象中，保持智能体推理上下文严格有界。在每个步骤中，智能体从工作区状态快照加上最近动作的固定窗口重构上下文。

Result: 在DeepResearch和80篇文献综述任务上的实验表明，无需任务特定微调，使用20B开源模型的InfiAgent与更大规模的专属系统竞争力相当，且在长时程覆盖范围上显著高于上下文中心基线。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持显式状态外部化作为稳定长时程智能体的实用基础。

Abstract: LLM agents can reason and use tools, but they often break down on long-horizon tasks due to unbounded context growth and accumulated errors. Common remedies such as context compression or retrieval-augmented prompting introduce trade-offs between information fidelity and reasoning stability. We present InfiAgent, a general-purpose framework that keeps the agent's reasoning context strictly bounded regardless of task duration by externalizing persistent state into a file-centric state abstraction. At each step, the agent reconstructs context from a workspace state snapshot plus a fixed window of recent actions. Experiments on DeepResearch and an 80-paper literature review task show that, without task-specific fine-tuning, InfiAgent with a 20B open-source model is competitive with larger proprietary systems and maintains substantially higher long-horizon coverage than context-centric baselines. These results support explicit state externalization as a practical foundation for stable long-horizon agents. Github Repo:https://github.com/ChenglinPoly/infiAgent

Abstract: Optimization is fundamental across numerous disciplines, typically following an iterative process of refining an initial solution to enhance performance. This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows. Applied in contexts like single/multi-image QA (e.g., OCRV2) and complex task analysis (e.g., BBH), HAPO demonstrates enhanced optimization efficiency, outperforming comparable automated prompt optimization methods and establishing an extensible paradigm for scalable prompt engineering.

Abstract: As conversational agents accumulate experience collaborating with users, adapting to user preferences is essential for fostering long-term relationships and improving collaboration quality over time. We introduce MultiSessionCollab, a benchmark that evaluates how well agents can learn user preferences and leverage them to improve collaboration quality throughout multiple sessions. To develop agents that succeed in this setting, we present long-term collaborative agents equipped with a memory that persists and refines user preference as interaction experience accumulates. Moreover, we demonstrate that learning signals can be derived from user simulator behavior in MultiSessionCollab to train agents to generate more comprehensive reflections and update their memory more effectively. Extensive experiments show that equipping agents with memory improves long-term collaboration, yielding higher task success rates, more efficient interactions, and reduced user effort. Finally, we conduct a human user study that demonstrates that memory helps improve user experience in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 早期AI范式在认知功能上相互割裂，Transformer大模型和世界模型的发晨促使它们向具有闭环'感知-决策-行动'能力的认知智能体融合。尽管大语言模型能生成流畅文本，但缺乏稳健的语义推理能力。虽然Chain-of-Thought等提示技术通过显式化中间步骤扩展了推理路径，但存在搜索完备性和效率限制。因此需要系统性优化智能体的时间维度推理能力，即'时间缩放'。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在有限认知资源下通过时序化序列推理解决复杂问题，但早期大语言模型缺乏稳健的语义推理能力。现有推理增强技术如Chain-of-Thought在搜索完备性和效率方面存在局限，这凸显出需要系统性地扩展智能体随时间展开推理的能力。

Method: 提出'时间缩放'概念——通过架构设计利用扩展的时间通路，支持更深层问题空间探索、动态策略调整和增强元认知控制。这种设计与人类在认知约束下的序列推理相似，旨在不对静态模型参数进行比例性增加的情况下增强深度推理和问题解决能力。

Result: 该研究论证了时间缩放作为增强人工智能系统推理能力的关键前沿方向，通过显式的时间推理管理支持智能体进行更深层的问题空间探索和动态策略调整。

Conclusion: 时间缩放代表了提升深度推理和问题解决能力的关键前沿，需要将显式时间推理管理作为基础性原则置于前沿位置，以推动智能体能力的进一步发展。

Abstract: Early artificial intelligence paradigms exhibited separated cognitive functions: Neural Networks focused on "perception-representation," Reinforcement Learning on "decision-making-behavior," and Symbolic AI on "knowledge-reasoning." With Transformer-based large models and world models, these paradigms are converging into cognitive agents with closed-loop "perception-decision-action" capabilities.
  Humans solve complex problems under limited cognitive resources through temporalized sequential reasoning. Language relies on problem space search for deep semantic reasoning. While early large language models (LLMs) could generate fluent text, they lacked robust semantic reasoning capabilities. Prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) extended reasoning paths by making intermediate steps explicit. Recent models like DeepSeek-R1 enhanced performance through explicit reasoning trajectories. However, these methods have limitations in search completeness and efficiency.
  This highlights the need for "Time-Scaling"--the systematic extension and optimization of an agent's ability to unfold reasoning over time. Time-Scaling refers to architectural design utilizing extended temporal pathways, enabling deeper problem space exploration, dynamic strategy adjustment, and enhanced metacognitive control, paralleling human sequential reasoning under cognitive constraints. It represents a critical frontier for enhancing deep reasoning and problem-solving without proportional increases in static model parameters. Advancing intelligent agent capabilities requires placing Time-Scaling principles at the forefront, positioning explicit temporal reasoning management as foundational.

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text generators to autonomous, goal-driven systems represents a fundamental shift in artificial intelligence. This chapter examines the emergence of agentic AI systems that integrate planning, memory, tool use, and iterative reasoning to operate autonomously in complex environments. We trace the architectural progression from statistical models to transformer-based systems, identifying capabilities that enable agentic behavior: long-range reasoning, contextual awareness, and adaptive decision-making. The chapter provides three contributions: (1) a synthesis of how LLM capabilities extend toward agency through reasoning-action-reflection loops; (2) an integrative framework describing core components perception, memory, planning, and tool execution that bridge LLMs with autonomous behavior; (3) a critical assessment of applications and persistent challenges in safety, alignment, reliability, and sustainability. Unlike existing surveys, we focus on the architectural transition from language understanding to autonomous action, emphasizing the technical gaps that must be resolved before deployment. We identify critical research priorities, including verifiable planning, scalable multi-agent coordination, persistent memory architectures, and governance frameworks. Responsible advancement requires simultaneous progress in technical robustness, interpretability, and ethical safeguards to realize potential while mitigating risks of misalignment and unintended consequences.

Conclusion: ChangeGPT通过提供智能性、适应性和多类型变化分析能力，为遥感应用中的决策支持提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing change detection methods often lack the versatility to handle diverse real-world queries and the intelligence for comprehensive analysis. This paper presents a general agent framework, integrating Large Language Models (LLM) with vision foundation models to form ChangeGPT. A hierarchical structure is employed to mitigate hallucination. The agent was evaluated on a curated dataset of 140 questions categorized by real-world scenarios, encompassing various question types (e.g., Size, Class, Number) and complexities. The evaluation assessed the agent's tool selection ability (Precision/Recall) and overall query accuracy (Match). ChangeGPT, especially with a GPT-4-turbo backend, demonstrated superior performance, achieving a 90.71 % Match rate. Its strength lies particularly in handling change-related queries requiring multi-step reasoning and robust tool selection. Practical effectiveness was further validated through a real-world urban change monitoring case study in Qianhai Bay, Shenzhen. By providing intelligence, adaptability, and multi-type change analysis, ChangeGPT offers a powerful solution for decision-making in remote sensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话中的人类相似度是AI与人类互动的核心，但难以定义、测量和优化，当前改进主要依赖规模化而非针对性对齐。

Method: 从对比对话数据中提取显性对话特征，组合成紧凑的标量分数作为透明奖励信号，采用标准偏好优化方法进行模型对齐。

Result: 对齐后的模型在不同规模下均能保持总体性能，大规模人工评估显示这些模型在对话中更频繁被感知为人类相似。

Conclusion: HAL展示了如何将语言中柔性的定性属性转化为可测量、可对齐的指标，为之前无法对齐的语言特性提供了可解释的对齐方法。

Abstract: Conversational human-likeness plays a central role in human-AI interaction, yet it has remained difficult to define, measure, and optimize. As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are essential for evidence-based medicine, but reviewing 1.5 million+ annual publications manually is infeasible. Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.
  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.
  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability. While this proof-of-concept evaluation used ten questions focused on dementia exercise research, the architectural approach demonstrates transferable principles for trustworthy medical AI and causal reasoning's potential for high-stakes healthcare.

Conclusion: 神经符号整合方法提高了样本效率、泛化能力、可解释性和可信度，在稀疏奖励环境和长规划时域任务中加速收敛

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.

Abstract: As an agent-level reasoning and coordination paradigm, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) orchestrates multiple agents through structured debate to improve answer quality and support complex reasoning. However, existing research on MAD suffers from two fundamental limitations: evaluations are conducted under fragmented and inconsistent settings, hindering fair comparison, and are largely restricted to single-modality scenarios that rely on textual inputs only. To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios. We believe M3MAD-Bench offers a reliable foundation for future research on standardized MAD evaluation. The code is available at http://github.com/liaolea/M3MAD-Bench.

Abstract: Task-oriented proactive dialogue agents play a pivotal role in recruitment, particularly for steering conversations towards specific business outcomes, such as acquiring social-media contacts for private-channel conversion. Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning remains a key challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in complex domains such as mathematics and creative writing. While recent approaches including ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine improve reasoning through iterative refinement and reflection, they often lack structured exploration of alternative solution paths and persistent learning across problems. We propose ReTreVal (Reasoning Tree with Validation), a hybrid framework that integrates Tree-of-Thoughts exploration, self-refinement, LLM-based critique scoring, and reflexion memory to enable bounded and validated multi-step reasoning. ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths. We evaluate ReTreVal against ReAct, Reflexion, and Self-Refine across 500 mathematical problems and creative writing tasks using Qwen 2.5 7B as the underlying LLM, and demonstrate that ReTreVal consistently outperforms existing methods through its combination of structured exploration, critique-driven refinement, and cross-problem memory, making it particularly effective for tasks requiring exploratory reasoning, rigorous verification, and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Symbolic logical reasoning is a critical yet underexplored capability of large language models (LLMs), providing reliable and verifiable decision-making in high-stakes domains such as mathematical reasoning and legal judgment. In this study, we present a systematic analysis of logical reasoning under controlled increases in logical complexity, and reveal a previously unrecognized phenomenon, which we term Logical Phase Transitions: rather than degrading smoothly, logical reasoning performance remains stable within a regime but collapses abruptly beyond a critical logical depth, mirroring physical phase transitions such as water freezing beyond a critical temperature threshold. Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

TL;DR: Batch-of-Thought (BoT) 是一种免训练方法，通过联合处理相关查询来实现跨实例学习，利用共享推理模式和一致性约束来提升LLM推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理系统独立处理每个查询，忽略了跨实例间的有用信号，如共享推理模式和一致性约束，这限制了性能和效率。

Method: 提出Batch-of-Thought (BoT)，在批处理中进行比较分析，识别高质量推理模板、通过一致性检查检测错误，并分摊计算成本；进一步引入多智能体反思架构BoT-R，其中反思器进行联合评估以获取孤立处理中不可得的互信息增益。

Result: 在三个模型系列和六个基准测试上的实验表明，BoT-R持续提高了准确性和置信度校准，同时将推理成本降低了高达61%。

Conclusion: 理论和实验分析揭示了批量感知推理对LLM系统何时及为何有益，为利用跨实例信号提升LLM推理提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model reasoning systems process queries independently, discarding valuable cross-instance signals such as shared reasoning patterns and consistency constraints. We introduce Batch-of-Thought (BoT), a training-free method that processes related queries jointly to enable cross-instance learning. By performing comparative analysis across batches, BoT identifies high-quality reasoning templates, detects errors through consistency checks, and amortizes computational costs. We instantiate BoT within a multi-agent reflection architecture (BoT-R), where a Reflector performs joint evaluation to unlock mutual information gain unavailable in isolated processing. Experiments across three model families and six benchmarks demonstrate that BoT-R consistently improves accuracy and confidence calibration while reducing inference costs by up to 61%. Our theoretical and experimental analysis reveals when and why batch-aware reasoning benefits LLM systems.

Abstract: The underperformance of existing multimodal large language models for time series reasoning lies in the absence of rationale priors that connect temporal observations to their downstream outcomes, which leads models to rely on superficial pattern matching rather than principled reasoning. We therefore propose the rationale-grounded in-context learning for time series reasoning, where rationales work as guiding reasoning units rather than post-hoc explanations, and develop the RationaleTS method. Specifically, we firstly induce label-conditioned rationales, composed of reasoning paths from observable evidence to the potential outcomes. Then, we design the hybrid retrieval by balancing temporal patterns and semantic contexts to retrieve correlated rationale priors for the final in-context inference on new samples. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed RationaleTS on three-domain time series reasoning tasks. We will release our code for reproduction.

Abstract: Timely leak detection in water distribution networks is critical for conserving resources and maintaining operational efficiency. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing spatial-temporal dependencies in sensor data, their black-box nature and the limited work on graph-based explainable models for water networks hinder practical adoption. We propose an explainable GNN framework that integrates mutual information to identify critical network regions and fuzzy logic to provide clear, rule-based explanations for node classification tasks. After benchmarking several GNN architectures, we selected the generalized graph convolution network (GENConv) for its superior performance and developed a fuzzy-enhanced variant that offers intuitive explanations for classified leak locations. Our fuzzy graph neural network (FGENConv) achieved Graph F1 scores of 0.889 for detection and 0.814 for localization, slightly below the crisp GENConv 0.938 and 0.858, respectively. Yet it compensates by providing spatially localized, fuzzy rule-based explanations. By striking the right balance between precision and explainability, the proposed fuzzy network could enable hydraulic engineers to validate predicted leak locations, conserve human resources, and optimize maintenance strategies. The code is available at github.com/pasqualedem/GNNLeakDetection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示工程方法复杂且需要调优，难以应用于新任务，尤其是在数据库列名扩展这一少人研究但对表格数据重要的任务上。

Method: 设计了一个无需调优和任务信息的自动提示工程系统，通过简单架构生成有效提示，并在英德双语数据集上评估。

Abstract: This paper presents a system for automatic prompt engineering that is much simpler in both design and application and yet as effective as the existing approaches. It requires no tuning and no explicit clues about the task. We evaluated our approach on cryptic column name expansion (CNE) in database tables, a task which is critical for tabular data search, access, and understanding and yet there has been very little existing work. We evaluated on datasets in two languages, English and German. This is the first work to report on the application of automatic prompt engineering for the CNE task. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work on the application of automatic prompt engineering for a language other than English.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新型多图结构记忆增强架构MAGMA，通过创建正交的记忆图谱分离时序、因果和实体信息，从而提升长上下文推理的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的记忆增强生成模型大多依赖单一记忆存储的语义相似性检索，这会导致时序、因果和实体信息相互纠缠，缺乏对查询意图与检索证据间关系的解释能力，限制了推理准确性。

Method: MAGMA架构将每个记忆项表示为相互正交的语义、时序、因果和实体图，检索过程通过在关系图上进行策略引导的遍历来实现查询自适应选择和结构化上下文构建，从而分离记忆表示与检索逻辑。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准上的实验表明，MAGMA在长时程推理任务中持续优于现有的最先进记忆系统。

Conclusion: MAGMA通过多图结构记忆架构有效解决了传统记忆增强模型中信息纠缠和缺乏可解释性的问题，在长上下文推理任务上取得了更好的性能，同时提供了透明的推理路径和更精细的检索控制。

Abstract: Memory-Augmented Generation (MAG) extends Large Language Models with external memory to support long-context reasoning, but existing approaches largely rely on semantic similarity over monolithic memory stores, entangling temporal, causal, and entity information. This design limits interpretability and alignment between query intent and retrieved evidence, leading to suboptimal reasoning accuracy. In this paper, we propose MAGMA, a multi-graph agentic memory architecture that represents each memory item across orthogonal semantic, temporal, causal, and entity graphs. MAGMA formulates retrieval as policy-guided traversal over these relational views, enabling query-adaptive selection and structured context construction. By decoupling memory representation from retrieval logic, MAGMA provides transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained control over retrieval. Experiments on LoCoMo and LongMemEval demonstrate that MAGMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agentic memory systems in long-horizon reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种‘物理Transformer’框架，将现代Transformer计算与几何表示和物理动力学相结合，旨在连接数字AI与物理世界，提升模型稳定性、长期准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的数字AI系统（如大语言模型、视觉模型）主要在虚拟符号或像素域运行，缺乏与物理世界的直接联系和物理解释性。作者希望通过引入物理动力学和几何结构，构建能够统一数字推理与物理基石的AI模型。

Method: 1. 微观层面：将注意力头和前馈块建模为受有效哈密顿量和非哈密顿浴项支配的相互作用自旋。
2. 中观层面：聚合状态在学习的神经微分流形（NDM）上遵循哈密顿流和HJB最优控制演化，并通过辛层离散化以保持几何和能量不变量。
3. 宏观层面：模型维护生成语义工作空间和二维信息-相图，跟踪推理轨迹中的不确定性和信息增益。
4. 推理任务被表述为流形上的受控信息流，解对应于满足几何、能量和工作空间一致性约束的低成本轨迹。

Result: 在涉及数值积分和动力系统的简单玩具问题上，物理Transformer在稳定性和长期预测准确性方面优于朴素基线，证明了尊重底层几何和哈密顿结构的优势。

Conclusion: 该框架为物理AI提供了一条路径，能够统一数字推理与物理基石的流形，有望实现更可解释且可能统一推理、控制与真实世界交互的模型。

Abstract: Digital AI systems spanning large language models, vision models, and generative architectures that operate primarily in symbolic, linguistic, or pixel domains. They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present WebGym, the largest-to-date open-source environment for training realistic visual web agents. Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively. This improvement is substantial because our test set consists only of tasks on websites never seen during training, unlike many other prior works on training visual web agents.

### [167] [mHC-GNN: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02451)
*Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出mHC-GNN，通过引入流形约束的超连接和并行流设计，缓解GNN的过平滑问题并突破1-WL表达能力限制，在深度架构中保持优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决GNN中存在的两个核心问题：深层架构中的过平滑现象，以及表达能力受限于1-Weisfeiler-Leman检验。传统的GNN在深度增加时性能急剧下降，且无法区分1-WL等价但实际不同的图结构。

Method: mHC-GNN使用并行流设计扩展节点表示，通过在流混合矩阵中应用Birkhoff多面体约束（使用Sinkhorn-Knopp归一化），实现了多流混合机制，将Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections技术从Transformer迁移到GNN。

Result: 方法将过平滑速率从(1-γ)^L降低到(1-γ)^{L/n}，证明可超越1-WL的表达能力。在10个数据集和4种GNN架构上的实验显示，标准GNN在16层后性能接近随机，而mHC-GNN在128层时仍能保持74%以上的准确率，极端深度下改进超过50个百分点。消融实验表明流形约束至关重要。

Conclusion: mHC-GNN通过引入流形约束和并行流机制，有效缓解了GNN的过平滑问题，突破了传统GNN的表达能力限制，使深度GNN架构变得实用可行。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from over-smoothing in deep architectures and expressiveness bounded by the 1-Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test. We adapt Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (\mhc)~\citep{xie2025mhc}, recently proposed for Transformers, to graph neural networks. Our method, mHC-GNN, expands node representations across $n$ parallel streams and constrains stream-mixing matrices to the Birkhoff polytope via Sinkhorn-Knopp normalization. We prove that mHC-GNN exhibits exponentially slower over-smoothing (rate $(1-γ)^{L/n}$ vs.\ $(1-γ)^L$) and can distinguish graphs beyond 1-WL. Experiments on 10 datasets with 4 GNN architectures show consistent improvements. Depth experiments from 2 to 128 layers reveal that standard GNNs collapse to near-random performance beyond 16 layers, while mHC-GNN maintains over 74\% accuracy even at 128 layers, with improvements exceeding 50 percentage points at extreme depths. Ablations confirm that the manifold constraint is essential: removing it causes up to 82\% performance degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文首次证明使用L2准确的分数估计和多模态数据，在温和曲率假设下，多项式小的步长即可保证总变差距离小的采样误差，扩展了先前对黎曼流形上扩散模型的理论分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中数据常局限在欧氏空间的子流形上。先前文献假设底层空间为欧氏空间，De Bortoli等人引入黎曼扩散模型，但其采样误差证明要求指数级小步长，且需数据分布光滑、严格正性，条件过于苛刻。

Method: 提出一种新理论分析框架，基于L2准确的分数估计，在仅需温和标准曲率假设的条件下，证明多项式小步长可保证样本与真实数据间的总变差距离误差小。核心分析工具包括热核对数梯度的李-杨不等式，以及摄动热方程的最小-普莱杰展开。

Result: 理论突破：与先前要求指数小步长相比，本文证明仅需多项式小步长即能获得小采样误差；放宽了数据分布需光滑和正性的限制；采样误差度量采用更强的总变差距离而非Wasserstein距离。

Conclusion: 该工作显著提升了非欧空间上扩散模型的理论分析，为更锐利的理论框架开辟了道路，对实际应用中的流形约束数据生成具有重要意义。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable empirical success in the recent years and are considered one of the state-of-the-art generative models in modern AI. These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution. Our analysis only requires mild and standard curvature assumptions on the underlying manifold. The main ingredients in our analysis are Li-Yau estimate for the log-gradient of heat kernel, and Minakshisundaram-Pleijel parametrix expansion of the perturbed heat equation. Our approach opens the door to a sharper analysis of diffusion models on non-Euclidean spaces.

TL;DR: I-GEM是梯度情景记忆(GEM)在低秩适配器(LoRA)子空间中的高效实现，通过固定预算、GPU驻留的双投影梯度近似，在保持GEM性能的同时大幅降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)的全微调计算成本高昂，需要参数高效的自适应方法进行持续学习(CL)。研究者希望重新审视梯度情景记忆(GEM)方法，并寻找在LoRA子空间中实现的高效替代方案。

Method: 在LoRA子空间中重新实现GEM，提出I-GEM方法：采用固定预算、GPU驻留的双投影梯度近似来替代GEM的二次投影。通过将非干扰约束仅限制在适配器参数内，保持GEM的稳定性同时大幅降低投影开销。

Result: 在3任务AG News拆分数据集上，使用GPT-2(355M)和LoRA(r=8)，I-GEM的平均准确率与GEM相当(差距约0.04分)，比A-GEM高出约1.4分。最关键的是，投影时间比GEM减少了约103倍。

Conclusion: 在LoRA子空间中应用GEM约束是实现LLM规模持续学习的实用途径，I-GEM方法在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is computationally costly, motivating Continual Learning (CL) approaches that utilize parameter-efficient adapters. We revisit Gradient Episodic Memory (GEM) within the Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) subspace and introduce I-GEM: a fixed-budget, GPU-resident dual projected-gradient approximation to GEM's quadratic projection. By constraining non-interference solely within the adapter parameters, I-GEM preserves GEM-like stability with orders-of-magnitude lower mean projection overhead. On a 3-task AG News split with induced domain drift, using GPT-2 (355M) and LoRA ($r=8$), I-GEM matches GEM's average accuracy (within $\sim\!0.04$ pts) and outperforms A-GEM by $\sim\!1.4$ pts. Crucially, it reduces projection time vs.\ GEM by a factor of $\sim\!10^3$. These results suggest that applying GEM constraints in the LoRA subspace is a practical pathway for continual learning at the LLM scale.

Conclusion: hdlib扩展显著提升了VSA的机器学习能力，为超维计算社区提供了更全面的工具集，特别是在量子超维计算方面的开创性实现。

Abstract: Following the initial publication of hdlib, a Python library for designing Vector-Symbolic Architectures (VSA), we introduce a major extension that significantly enhances its machine learning capabilities. VSA, also known as Hyperdimensional Computing, is a computing paradigm that represents and processes information using high-dimensional vectors. While the first version of hdlib established a robust foundation for creating and manipulating these vectors, this update addresses the growing need for more advanced, data-driven modeling within the VSA framework. Here, we present four extensions: significant enhancements to the existing supervised classification model also enabling feature selection, and a new regression model for predicting continuous variables, a clustering model for unsupervised learning, and a graph-based learning model. Furthermore, we propose the first implementation ever of Quantum Hyperdimensional Computing with quantum-powered arithmetic operations and a new Quantum Machine Learning model for supervised learning. hdlib remains open-source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib under the MIT license, and distributed through the Python Package Index (pip install hdlib) and Conda (conda install -c conda-forge hdlib). Documentation and examples of these new features are available on the official Wiki at https://github.com/cumbof/hdlib/wiki.

Abstract: Time pressure critically influences risky maneuvers and crash proneness among powered two-wheeler riders, yet its prediction remains underexplored in intelligent transportation systems. We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dermatological imaging and mobile diagnostic tools calls for systems that not only demonstrate empirical performance but also provide strong theoretical guarantees. Deep learning models have shown high predictive accuracy; however, they are often criticized for lacking well, calibrated uncertainty estimates without which these models are hardly deployable in a clinical setting. To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference. CBDC offers distribution, dependent generalization bounds that reflect dermatological variability, proves a topological stability theorem that guarantees the invariance of convolutional neural network embeddings under photometric and morphological perturbations and provides finite conformal coverage guarantees for trustworthy uncertainty quantification.
  Through exhaustive experiments on the HAM10000, PH2, and ISIC 2020 datasets, we show that CBDC not only attains classification accuracy but also generates calibrated predictions that are interpretable from a clinical perspective. This research constitutes a theoretical and practical leap for deep dermatological diagnostics, thereby opening the machine learning theory clinical applicability interface.

Abstract: Credit risk assessment is essential in the financial sector, but has traditionally depended on costly feature-based models that often fail to utilize all available information in raw credit records. This paper introduces LendNova, the first practical automated end-to-end pipeline for credit risk assessment, designed to utilize all available information in raw credit records by leveraging advanced NLP techniques and language models. LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability. Evaluation on real-world data further demonstrates its strong potential in accurate and efficient risk assessment. LendNova establishes a baseline for intelligent credit risk agents, demonstrating the feasibility of language models in this domain. It lays the groundwork for future research toward foundation systems that enable more accurate, adaptable, and automated financial decision-making.

TL;DR: Chronicals是一个开源的大语言模型微调框架，通过四重优化将7B参数模型的微调内存需求从84GB降低，在A100-40GB上实现3.51倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型微调面临内存瓶颈——7B参数模型需要84GB内存（权重14GB+梯度14GB+优化器状态56GB），超过A100-40GB的容量。现有方案如Unsloth的报告存在模型实际未训练的缺陷。

Method: Chronicals采用四项协同优化：1) 融合Triton内核通过RMSNorm(7x)、SwiGLU(5x)和QK-RoPE(2.3x)融合减少75%内存流量；2) Cut Cross-Entropy通过在线softmax计算将logit内存从5GB降到135MB；3) LoRA+通过理论推导的16倍差分学习率优化适配器矩阵；4) Best-Fit Decreasing序列打包回收60-75%因填充浪费的计算。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-0.5B模型和A100-40GB上，Chronicals实现：完整微调41,184 tokens/s对比Unsloth的11,736 tokens/s（3.51x加速）；rank 32的LoRA微调11,699 tokens/s对比Unsloth MAX的2,857 tokens/s（4.10x加速）。发现Unsloth报告的46,000 tokens/s基准测试时梯度范数为零——模型实际未训练。

Abstract: Large language model fine-tuning is bottlenecked by memory: a 7B parameter model requires 84GB--14GB for weights, 14GB for gradients, and 56GB for FP32 optimizer states--exceeding even A100-40GB capacity. We present Chronicals, an open-source training framework achieving 3.51x speedup over Unsloth through four synergistic optimizations: (1) fused Triton kernels eliminating 75% of memory traffic via RMSNorm (7x), SwiGLU (5x), and QK-RoPE (2.3x) fusion; (2) Cut Cross-Entropy reducing logit memory from 5GB to 135MB through online softmax computation; (3) LoRA+ with theoretically-derived 16x differential learning rates between adapter matrices; and (4) Best-Fit Decreasing sequence packing recovering 60-75% of compute wasted on padding.
  On Qwen2.5-0.5B with A100-40GB, Chronicals achieves 41,184 tokens/second for full fine-tuning versus Unsloth's 11,736 tokens/second (3.51x). For LoRA at rank 32, we reach 11,699 tokens/second versus Unsloth MAX's 2,857 tokens/second (4.10x). Critically, we discovered that Unsloth's reported 46,000 tokens/second benchmark exhibited zero gradient norms--the model was not training.
  We provide complete mathematical foundations: online softmax correctness proofs, FlashAttention IO complexity bounds O(N^2 d^2 M^{-1}), LoRA+ learning rate derivations from gradient magnitude analysis, and bin-packing approximation guarantees. All implementations, benchmarks, and proofs are available at https://github.com/Ajwebdevs/Chronicals with pip installation via https://pypi.org/project/chronicals/.

Abstract: We introduce a problem-level prioritization framework for RL post-training of large language models. Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting. Overall, the approach offers a principled and scalable alternative to manually designed curricula while aligning data selection directly with the dynamics of GRPO-based post-training.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的大量实验验证了SpikingGPF方法的有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: SpikingGPF首次将脉冲神经元机制应用于图稀疏提示学习，实现了更紧凑、轻量且鲁棒的图提示特征学习框架

Abstract: Graph Prompt Feature (GPF) learning has been widely used in adapting pre-trained GNN model on the downstream task. GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.

Abstract: Feature selection is essential for high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling stronger predictive performance, reduced computational cost, and improved interpretability in precision medicine applications. Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.

Abstract: Financial institutions and regulators require systems that integrate heterogeneous data to assess risks from stock fluctuations to systemic vulnerabilities. Existing approaches often treat these tasks in isolation, failing to capture cross-scale dependencies. We propose Uni-FinLLM, a unified multimodal large language model that uses a shared Transformer backbone and modular task heads to jointly process financial text, numerical time series, fundamentals, and visual data. Through cross-modal attention and multi-task optimization, it learns a coherent representation for micro-, meso-, and macro-level predictions. Evaluated on stock forecasting, credit-risk assessment, and systemic-risk detection, Uni-FinLLM significantly outperforms baselines. It raises stock directional accuracy to 67.4% (from 61.7%), credit-risk accuracy to 84.1% (from 79.6%), and macro early-warning accuracy to 82.3%. Results validate that a unified multimodal LLM can jointly model asset behavior and systemic vulnerabilities, offering a scalable decision-support engine for finance.

Abstract: Robustness to malicious attacks is crucial for practical decentralized signal processing and machine learning systems. A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Rotary位置编码实现虽然简洁地表达为复数线性代数，但实际Q/K/V投影的实现并非真正的复数线性变换。作者认为复数线性变换是更自然的参数化方式，能够去除冗余参数，提高参数利用率，并获得更清晰的表示空间解释

Method: 将Rotary位置编码中的Q/K/V投影重新设计为真正的复数线性变换，而不是现有的伪实现方式。这种修改使得注意力块的参数使用更高效，减少了近50%的参数

Result: 通过实验验证，移除这种参数冗余对模型性能（无论是样本内还是样本外）影响可以忽略不计。新方法实现了更高效的参数利用，并为表示空间提供了更干净的解释

Conclusion: 采用真正的复数线性变换作为Rotary位置编码的参数化方式是一个更优的选择，它显著减少了参数总量（约50%），同时保持了模型性能，实现了更紧凑、解释性更好的表示空间

Abstract: Rotary positional embedding has become the state-of-the-art approach to encode position information in transformer-based models. While it is often succinctly expressed in complex linear algebra, we note that the actual implementation of $Q/K/V$-projections is not equivalent to a complex linear transformation. We argue that complex linear transformation is a more natural parametrization and saves near 50\% parameters within the attention block. We show empirically that removing such redundancy has negligible impact on the model performance both in sample and out of sample. Our modification achieves more efficient parameter usage, as well as a cleaner interpretation of the representation space.

Abstract: Tree ensemble methods such as Random Forests naturally induce supervised similarity measures through their decision tree structure, but existing implementations of proximities derived from tree ensembles typically suffer from quadratic time or memory complexity, limiting their scalability. In this work, we introduce a general framework for efficient proximity computation by defining a family of Separable Weighted Leaf-Collision Proximities. We show that any proximity measure in this family admits an exact sparse matrix factorization, restricting computation to leaf-level collisions and avoiding explicit pairwise comparisons. This formulation enables low-memory, scalable proximity computation using sparse linear algebra in Python. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate substantial runtime and memory improvements over traditional approaches, allowing tree ensemble proximities to scale efficiently to datasets with hundreds of thousands of samples on standard CPU hardware.

Abstract: With the rapid development of e-commerce, auto-bidding has become a key asset in optimizing advertising performance under diverse advertiser environments. The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.
  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives. Notably, in large-scale real-world A/B testing, QGA achieves a 3.27% increase in Ad GMV and a 2.49% improvement in Ad ROI.

Abstract: Precise day-ahead forecasts for electricity prices are crucial to ensure efficient portfolio management, support strategic decision-making for power plant operations, enable efficient battery storage optimization, and facilitate demand response planning. However, developing an accurate prediction model is highly challenging in an uncertain and volatile market environment. For instance, although linear models generally exhibit competitive performance in predicting electricity prices with minimal computational requirements, they fail to capture relevant nonlinear relationships. Nonlinear models, on the other hand, can improve forecasting accuracy with a surge in computational costs. We propose a novel multivariate neural network approach that combines linear and nonlinear feed-forward neural structures. Unlike previous hybrid models, our approach integrates online learning and forecast combination for efficient training and accuracy improvement. It also incorporates all relevant characteristics, particularly the fundamental relationships arising from wind and solar generation, electricity demand patterns, related energy fuel and carbon markets, in addition to autoregressive dynamics and calendar effects. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark models, the proposed forecasting method significantly reduces computational cost while delivering superior forecasting accuracy (12-13% RMSE and 15-18% MAE reductions). Our results are derived from a six-year forecasting study conducted on major European electricity markets.

Abstract: Stochastic contextual bandits are fundamental for sequential decision-making but pose significant challenges for existing neural network-based algorithms, particularly when scaling to quantum neural networks (QNNs) due to issues such as massive over-parameterization, computational instability, and the barren plateau phenomenon. This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.
  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $Ω((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $Ω((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.

Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive comparison of domain generalization techniques applied to time series data within a drilling context, focusing on the prediction of a continuous Stick-Slip Index (SSI), a critical metric for assessing torsional downhole vibrations at the drill bit. The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model. Overall, the results indicate that both ADG and IRM models surpass the baseline, with the ADG model exhibiting a slight advantage over the IRM model. Additionally, applying TL to a pre-trained model further improves performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of domain generalization approaches in drilling applications, with ADG emerging as the most effective approach.

Abstract: Visually impaired users face significant challenges in daily information access and real-time environmental perception, and there is an urgent need for intelligent assistive systems with accurate recognition capabilities. Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.

Abstract: Controlling emergent behavioral personas (e.g., sycophancy, hallucination) in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI safety, yet remains a persistent challenge. Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as "black boxes" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward. Crucially, on sycophancy, our automatically discovered prompts achieve significant improvement (49.90% compared with 79.24%). By grounding prompt discovery in mechanistically meaningful features, our method offers a new paradigm for controllable and interpretable behavior modification.

Abstract: In many fairness and distribution robustness problems, one has access to labeled data from multiple source distributions yet the test data may come from an arbitrary member or a mixture of them. We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning. In synthetic and real-data experiments, our method delivers valid worst-case coverage across multiple distributions while greatly reducing the set size compared with naively applying max-p aggregation to single-source conformity scores, and can be comparable in size to single-source prediction sets with popular, standard conformity scores.

Result: 理论证明SPICE在随机多臂赌博机和有限时间MDP中都能实现最优后悔行为，即使只使用次优轨迹进行预训练。实验验证在赌博机和控制基准测试中，SPICE相比现有ICRL和元RL方法显著降低后悔，快速适应未见任务，并在分布偏移下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPICE是一种有效的贝叶斯上下文强化学习方法，能够在仅使用次优数据预训练的情况下，实现快速适应和接近最优的决策，解决了当前ICRL方法的关键局限性。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) promises fast adaptation to unseen environments without parameter updates, but current methods either cannot improve beyond the training distribution or require near-optimal data, limiting practical adoption. We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的因果流形公平性(CMF)框架，将因果推断与几何深度学习相结合，通过学习保持敏感属性干预下局部黎曼几何不变性的潜在表示来解决机器学习公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习公平性方法通常将数据视为高维空间中的静态点，忽略了潜在的生成结构和敏感属性对数据流形几何形状的因果扭曲作用。

Method: CMF通过学习潜在表示，使得局部黎曼几何（由度量张量和曲率定义）在对敏感属性进行反事实干预时保持不变，通过对解码器的Jacobian和Hessian施加约束来确保潜在空间的距离和形状规则在不同人口群体间保持一致。

Result: 在合成结构因果模型(SCMs)上的验证表明，CMF能有效解耦敏感的几何扭曲，同时保持任务效用，并通过几何度量提供了对公平性-效用权衡的严格量化。

Conclusion: CMF框架为理解敏感属性如何因果性地扭曲数据流形提供了新视角，并通过保持几何不变性来实现更根本的公平性，超越了传统的分布对齐方法。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is increasingly critical, yet standard approaches often treat data as static points in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying generative structure. We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.

Abstract: Recent work by Anthropic on Mechanistic interpretability claims to understand and control Large Language Models by extracting human-interpretable features from their neural activation patterns using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.

### [192] [Joint Encoding of KV-Cache Blocks for Scalable LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03067)
*Joseph Kampeas,Emir Haleva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出KV缓存联合编码方法，通过跨请求融合相似块来压缩内存，支持高并发LLM推理，提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型KV缓存内存占用随并发请求增长，现有压缩方法依赖启发式规则、破坏张量布局或需要专用硬件，可扩展性和部署受限。

Method: 联合编码KV缓存块，将跨请求和输入块的相似块融合为共享表示，同时保留标准缓存结构，无需专用硬件。理论分析采用泊松过程模型研究融合块的率失真权衡。

Result: 方法在多样化LLM和基准测试中实现最高4.38倍KV缓存压缩，精度损失可忽略；在vLLM单机基准测试中提升约40%token吞吐量。

Conclusion: KV缓存联合编码有效缓解内存瓶颈，支持高并发服务，显著提升推理吞吐量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) drive interactive AI systems but are bottlenecked by the memory-heavy growth of key-value (KV) caches, which limits real-time throughput under concurrent loads. Existing KV-cache compression methods rely on rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor layouts, or require specialized compute, hindering scalability and deployment.
  We propose joint encoding of KV-cache blocks, which fuses similar blocks across requests and input chunks into shared representations while preserving standard cache structure. This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\sim$40\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

Abstract: To ensure reliability and service availability, next-generation networks are expected to rely on automated anomaly detection systems powered by advanced machine learning methods with the capability of handling multi-dimensional data. Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic biases across demographic groups. Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $Δ$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \textsc{CivilComments} and \textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\varepsilon=0.02$ for \textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs. These results suggest that active sampling can reduce resources needed for independent fairness auditing with LLMs, supporting continuous model evaluations.

TL;DR: ATLAS提出了一种在推理时动态控制潜在空间转向的自适应方法，通过轻量级验证器评估推理质量并调整转向强度，相比固定转向策略，在多项数学推理基准测试中实现了更高的精度和更低的计算开销。


<details>

Motivation: 现有激活和潜在转向方法主要依赖固定的转向策略和静态干预强度，这限制了在不同问题实例间的鲁棒性，常常导致过度转向或转向不足的问题。

Method: ATLAS在推理时使用外部轻量级潜在验证器动态控制转向决策，验证器根据中间隐藏状态预测推理质量，在每个样本和推理步骤中自适应选择是否应用转向以及转向强度。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，ATEAS在保持高精度的同时显著减少了推理时的token使用量，超越普通解码和固定转向方法。

Conclusion: 验证器引导的潜在自适应提供了一种有效且可扩展的机制，可在不牺牲求解质量的情况下控制推理效率。所有源代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Recent work on activation and latent steering has demonstrated that modifying internal representations can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) toward improved reasoning and efficiency without additional training. However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. All source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a direct neural interface for decoding muscle activity and offers a promising foundation for keyboard-free text input in wearable and mixed-reality systems. Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成控制方法通常将干预前时间顺序视为可互换的，无法充分利用时间结构，特别是在存在强趋势时效果受限

Method: TASC采用状态空间模型，结合恒定趋势和低秩信号结构，使用卡尔曼滤波和Rauch-Tung-Striebel平滑器，通过期望最大化拟合生成时间序列模型，然后进行反事实推断

Result: 在模拟数据和真实世界数据（政策评估和体育预测）上的评估表明，TASC在强时间趋势和高观测噪声场景中具有优势

Conclusion: TASC方法通过考虑时间结构，扩展了合成控制框架，在存在明显趋势时能更有效地进行因果推断

Abstract: The synthetic control (SC) framework is widely used for observational causal inference with time-series panel data. SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable. This invariance means they may not fully take advantage of temporal structure when strong trends are present. We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference. We evaluate TASC on both simulated and real-world datasets, including policy evaluation and sports prediction. Our results suggest that TASC offers advantages in settings with strong temporal trends and high levels of observation noise.

Abstract: The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.

TL;DR: 为解决金融交易数据隐私限制导致研究受限的问题，研究者提出 PersonaLedger，这是一个结合大语言模型与规则引擎的合成数据生成方法，可同时保证行为多样性与逻辑可靠性，并发布了包含 3000 万笔交易的数据集和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 严格的隐私法规限制了真实交易数据的访问，阻碍了金融 AI 的开放研究。现有合成数据生成方法存在不足：基于规则的模拟器无法捕捉人类行为的丰富性，基于学习的方法则容易违反硬性金融约束且仍然依赖私有数据训练。

Method: PersonaLedger 采用大型语言模型结合可配置的程序引擎，在循环交互中生成交易流：LLM 基于丰富用户角色生成多样化交易提议，引擎更新用户状态、强制执行金融规则，并生成上下文敏感的“下一步提示”引导 LLM 产生可行的后续行动。

Result: 使用 PersonaLedger 生成了一个包含 23000 个用户的 3000 万笔交易的公开数据集，并配套了包含流动性不足分类和身份盗窃分割两个任务的基准测试套件。

Conclusion: PersonaLedger 提供了一个真实、隐私保护的资源，支持金融 AI 中预测和异常检测模型的严格评估，能加速该领域的创新并确保研究的可重现性。

Abstract: Strict privacy regulations limit access to real transaction data, slowing open research in financial AI. Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware "nextprompt" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation. PersonaLedger offers a realistic, privacy preserving resource that supports rigorous evaluation of forecasting and anomaly detection models. PersonaLedger offers the community a rich, realistic, and privacy preserving resource -- complete with code, rules, and generation logs -- to accelerate innovation in financial AI and enable rigorous, reproducible evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统被集成到实际应用中，组织需要理解和解释其行为，特别是决策者需要知道输入（提示）中什么因素导致系统产生具有特定特性（如毒性、负面情绪、政治倾向）的输出。传统反事实解释方法不适用于生成式AI系统，因此需要新的解释框架。

Method: 论文提出了一个适应非确定性生成式AI系统的反事实解释框架，其中引入下游分类器来揭示输出的关键特性。基于该框架，开发了生成提示-反事实解释（PCEs）的算法。

Result: 通过三个案例研究（政治倾向、毒性、情感）验证了PCEs框架的有效性，表明PCEs可以简化提示工程以抑制不希望的输出特性，并增强红队测试以发现更多引发不良输出的提示。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成式AI中基于提示的可解释性奠定了基础，这种能力对于模型承担更高风险任务及满足透明度和问责的监管要求至关重要。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.

Motivation: 现有Python时间序列增强库存在性能瓶颈，在处理大规模数据时运行时间呈指数增长，这限制了它们在大型生产系统中的应用；需要开发高性能的增强库来解决这一问题。

Method: 作者开发了RATS库，使用Rust编写核心代码并提供Python绑定；实现了多种增强方法包括基本变换、频域操作和时间扭曲技术；提供统一管道接口并内置并行化支持。

Result: 在143个数据集上的基准测试显示，RATSpy相比tsaug平均速度提升74.5%，在大型数据集上最高可达94.8%，同时峰值内存使用减少最高达47.9%。

Conclusion: RATS是一个高效、内存友好的时间序列增强库，通过高性能的Rust实现解决了现有Python库在大规模数据场景下的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Time series augmentation is critical for training robust deep learning models, particularly in domains where labelled data is scarce and expensive to obtain. However, existing augmentation libraries for time series, mainly written in Python, suffer from performance bottlenecks, where running time grows exponentially as dataset sizes increase -- an aspect limiting their applicability in large-scale, production-grade systems. We introduce RATS (Rapid Augmentations for Time Series), a high-performance library for time series augmentation written in Rust with Python bindings (RATSpy). RATS implements multiple augmentation methods spanning basic transformations, frequency-domain operations and time warping techniques, all accessible through a unified pipeline interface with built-in parallelisation. Comprehensive benchmarking of RATSpy versus a commonly used library (tasug) on 143 datasets demonstrates that RATSpy achieves an average speedup of 74.5\% over tsaug (up to 94.8\% on large datasets), with up to 47.9\% less peak memory usage.

*Daphne Theodorakopoulos,Marcel Wever,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于动态超参数重要性（HPI）的多目标优化（MOO）方法，针对超参数重要性随目标权衡变化的现象，优化过程中优先考虑影响最大的超参数，从而加速收敛并提升帕累托前沿质量。通过在PyMOO和YAHPO-Gym等平台验证，相较于基线方法展现出显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MOO方法通常将所有超参数视为同等重要，忽视了超参数的重要性会随着目标之间的权衡而显著变化。这一局限性导致优化效率低下，难以在准确性、模型大小、公平性、推理时间和能耗等多个目标间找到最优平衡。因此，需要一种能够动态调整超参数优先级以提升优化效果的方法。

Method: 1. 基于HyperSHAP计算超参数重要性（HPI）。2. 利用ParEGO算法自然产生的目标权重。3. 在优化过程中根据目标权衡动态调整配置空间：固定不重要的超参数，使搜索聚焦于重要超参数。4. 构建动态优化框架，将HPI整合到MOO流程中。

Result: 在PyMOO和YAHPO-Gym的多种任务上进行验证，结果表明该方法在收敛速度和帕累托前沿质量方面均优于基线方法，证实了动态超参数优先级调整的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过动态调整超参数重要性，本文提出的方法能够更有效地处理多目标优化问题，不仅在搜索效率上有显著提升，还能获得更优的帕累托解集。这一研究成果为复杂机器学习模型选择中的多目标权衡问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Choosing a suitable ML model is a complex task that can depend on several objectives, e.g., accuracy, model size, fairness, inference time, or energy consumption. In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones. Eventually, we validate our method with diverse tasks from PyMOO and YAHPO-Gym. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in convergence speed and Pareto front quality compared to baselines.

Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.
  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.
  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.

Abstract: Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence. Through extensive evaluation across representative MLLMs, we provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of current models.

Abstract: Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorporates the uncertainty of specifying a causal graph into CF. CF-GU (i) bootstraps a Causal Discovery algorithm under domain knowledge constraints to produce a bag of plausible Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), (ii) quantifies graph uncertainty with the normalized Shannon entropy, and (iii) provides confidence bounds on CF metrics. Experiments on synthetic data show how contrasting domain knowledge assumptions support or refute audits of CF, while experiments on real-world data (COMPAS and Adult datasets) pinpoint well-known biases with high confidence, even when supplied with minimal domain knowledge constraints.

Motivation: 现有的扩散模型遗忘方法主要依赖监督权重编辑或全局惩罚，而强化学习方法虽然灵活但通常优化稀疏的轨迹末端奖励，导致高方差更新和弱信用分配。需要一种更稳定有效的强化学习框架来改进扩散模型的概念遗忘。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.

Abstract: Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.

Motivation: TURTLE算法在平衡数据上表现优异，但假设数据平衡，当面对不平衡数据分布时，会产生不理想的超平面，导致聚类错误增加。为了解决这一问题，需要一种能够处理不平衡数据分布的聚类方法。

Method: 基于TURTLE算法进行改进：1）引入幂律先验来扩展损失函数，使其能够处理不平衡数据分布；2）在标签化过程中引入稀疏逻辑，简化搜索空间。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，PET-TURTLE能够：1）提高不平衡数据源的聚类准确率；2）防止对少数类群的过度预测；3）提升整体聚类性能。对于平衡数据集，稀疏逻辑的引入也提升了准确率。

Abstract: Foundation vision, audio, and language models enable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks via their latent representations. Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that PET-TURTLE improves accuracy for imbalanced sources, prevents over-prediction of minority clusters, and enhances overall clustering.
