Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.

Abstract: Soccer understanding has recently garnered growing research interest due to its domain-specific complexity and unique challenges. Unlike prior works that typically rely on isolated, task-specific expert models, this work aims to propose a unified model to handle diverse soccer visual understanding tasks, ranging from fine-grained perception (e.g., athlete detection) to semantic reasoning (e.g., event classification). Specifically, our contributions are threefold: (i) we present SoccerMaster, the first soccer-specific vision foundation model that unifies diverse understanding tasks within a single framework via supervised multi-task pretraining; (ii) we develop an automated data curation pipeline to generate scalable spatial annotations, and integrate them with various existing soccer video datasets to construct SoccerFactory, a comprehensive pretraining data resource; and (iii) we conduct extensive evaluations demonstrating that SoccerMaster consistently outperforms task-specific expert models across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its breadth and superiority. The data, code, and model will be publicly available.

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.

Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.

Conclusion: 该研究表明，通过改进现有视觉语言模型，可以有效地将零样本学习扩展到热成像应用领域，实现无标签监测。

Abstract: Many manufacturing environments operate in low-light conditions or within enclosed machines where conventional vision systems struggle. Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGent是一个新的视觉定位模型，采用模块化编码器-解码器架构，分离高层推理和bbox预测，实现高效、准确的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉定位方法的局限性：基于MLLM的自回归解码速度慢且有幻觉风险；或使用重新对齐方法会削弱LLM的推理能力。

Method: VGent使用冻结的MLLM作为编码器保持推理能力，采用目标检测器生成bbox作为解码器query，通过跨注意力从编码器状态选择目标bbox，支持模块化升级，包括QuadThinker基于RL的训练范式、mask-aware标签和全局目标识别。

Result: 在多目标视觉定位基准测试中实现新SOTA，F1指标提升+20.6%；视觉参考挑战下gIoU提升+8.2%，cIoU提升+5.8%；保持快速推理延迟。

Conclusion: VGent能够充分利用目标检测和MLLM的优势，避免自回归解码陷阱，实现快速推理，为视觉任务提供一种新的、有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了无需配对数据的后训练域自适应框架LEGO，通过生成模型获取伪标签并微调预训练模型，以应对现实世界中分布外退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于显著域差距的存在，预训练图像修复模型在实际分布外退化场景中常表现不佳。分布外数据缺乏真值标注，且传统自适应方法通常需要复杂的架构调整。

Method: 提出了三阶段的LEGO框架：1）从预训练模型获取初步修复结果；2）利用冻结的大规模生成模型将估计结果精炼为高质量伪真值；3）通过混合监督策略结合原域数据和新的伪数据对微调原始模型。

Result: 实验表明LEGO能有效弥合域差距，在多样化的现实世界基准测试中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LEGO是一个实用的后训练域自适应框架，能够在无需架构修改的情况下适应新分布，同时保持原始模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.

TL;DR: ItemizedCLIP通过使用交叉注意力机制为每个文本项生成条件化的视觉嵌入，并以定制化目标确保项目独立性和表征完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多视觉领域（如医学影像、遥感）包含具有多个独立文本标注的图像，这些标注不同于标准的多标题监督，每个文本项描述图像中独立且语义不同的发现。现有方法难以处理这种分项化的文本监督。

Method: 提出ItemizedCLIP框架，使用交叉注意力模块为每个文本项生成条件化的视觉嵌入，并设计专门的目标函数来强制项目独立性（不同项目对应不同区域）和表征完整性（覆盖所有项目）。

Result: 在四个自然分项文本监督的领域（脑部MRI、头部CT、胸部CT、遥感）和一个合成的分项数据集上，ItemizedCLIP在零样本性能和细粒度可解释性方面均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ItemizedCLIP学习到的表征具有语义基础、项目可区分性、完整性和视觉可解释性，为具有独立文本项标注的视觉领域提供了有效的表示学习方法。

Abstract: Training vision models with language supervision enables general and transferable representations. However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image. Such supervision differs from standard multi-caption supervision, where captions are redundant or highly overlapping. Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines. The resulting ItemizedCLIP representations are semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/ItemizedCLIP.

Motivation: 由于复杂多模态模型往往缺乏透明的实现细节和可访问的训练基础设施，本研究旨在对Monkey VLM进行可复现性验证和批判性分析，为未来高分辨率多模态建模提供实践见解。

Method: 使用开放检查点复制Monkey VLM策略，重新实现训练管道，并通过图像分块方法研究高分辨率图像理解，同时扩展研究了全局上下文信息的影响。

Result: 确认了原始Monkey VLM的核心发现，即分块策略能有效恢复局部细节，但结果存在偏差，这些偏差的程度严重依赖于任务类型和分块粒度大小。

Conclusion: 图像分块是一种有效的高分辨率视觉理解策略，但需要进行精细化任务调整，全局上下文的纳入能提供补充价值，未来的多模态建模应考虑任务相关性和分块粒度的优化。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.

Abstract: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%. The code is available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/LGSCV .

Abstract: Crafting computer-aided design (CAD) models has long been a painstaking and time-intensive task, demanding both precision and expertise from designers. With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints. Intensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前MLLM在安全关键型野火监测应用中的严重局限性，凸显了需要开发改进早期烟雾定位能力的新方法。

Abstract: Wildfire smoke is transparent, amorphous, and often visually confounded with clouds, making early-stage detection particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.

Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating controllable and interactive indoor scenes is fundamental to applications in game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training. Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.

Abstract: Existing methods achieve high-quality facial appearance capture under controllable lighting, which increases capture cost and limits usability. We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin. Our code will be released \href{https://yxuhan.github.io/WildCap/index.html}{\textcolor{magenta}{here}}.

Conclusion: 提出的跨模态提示方法（ComP）通过增强模态特定特征和提升各模态性能，有效解决了不完全多模态情感识别中的性能差距和模态欠优化问题，提高了整体识别准确率。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition (IMER) aims at understanding human intentions and sentiments by comprehensively exploring the partially observed multi-source data. Although the multi-modal data is expected to provide more abundant information, the performance gap and modality under-optimization problem hinder effective multi-modal learning in practice, and are exacerbated in the confrontation of the missing data. To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is designed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 SOTA methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.
  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.
  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

Abstract: Invasive species pose major global threats to ecosystems and agriculture. Serrated tussock (\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset. These findings highlight the potential of multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models for scalable invasive species classification.

Abstract: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Abstract: Video autoencoders compress videos into compact latent representations for efficient reconstruction, playing a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of video generation. However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. Moreover, evaluations on video generation tasks highlight its strong potential for downstream applications.

Abstract: Multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction holds significant research value for applications in holographic documentation of social interactions. However, existing reconstruction datasets focus on static multi-view or single-egocentric view setups, lacking multi-view egocentric datasets for dynamic scene reconstruction. Therefore, we present MultiEgo, the first multi-view egocentric dataset for 4D dynamic scene reconstruction. The dataset comprises five canonical social interaction scenes: meetings, performances, and a presentation. Each scene provides five authentic egocentric videos captured by participants wearing AR glasses. We design a hardware-based data acquisition system and processing pipeline, achieving sub-millisecond temporal synchronization across views, coupled with accurate pose annotations. Experiment validation demonstrates the practical utility and effectiveness of our dataset for free-viewpoint video (FVV) applications, establishing MultiEgo as a foundational resource for advancing multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction research.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D facial animation from natural language requires understanding both temporally structured semantics and fine-grained expression changes. Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

TL;DR: FreqDINO是一种针对超声图像分割的频率引导框架，通过分离低频结构和高频边界细节，并引入边界细化模块，解决了DINOv3在超声图像边界感知不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像分割在临床诊断中至关重要，但受到斑点噪声和成像伪影的挑战。尽管DINOv3在医学图像分割中表现出强大的表示能力，但由于其预训练基于自然图像，对超声图像特有的边界退化不敏感。因此，需要开发更适用于超声图像边界感知的分割方法。

Method: 提出FreqDINO框架，包含三个核心组件：1）多尺度频率提取与对齐（MFEA）策略，分离低频结构信息与多尺度高频边界细节，并通过可学习注意力对齐；2）频率引导边界细化（FGBR）模块，从高频组件提取边界原型并优化空间特征；3）多任务边界引导解码器（MBGD），确保边界预测与语义预测的空间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明FreqDINO超越了现有最先进方法，并展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FreqDINO通过频率引导方法有效增强了超声图像分割的边界感知和结构一致性，为处理超声图像特有的挑战提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound image segmentation is pivotal for clinical diagnosis, yet challenged by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features. Furthermore, we design a Multi-task Boundary-Guided Decoder (MBGD) to ensure spatial coherence between boundary and semantic predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDINO surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior achieves remarkable generalization capability.

Abstract: With the advancement of multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs), Video LLMs have been further developed to perform on holistic and specialized video understanding. However, existing works are limited to specialized video understanding tasks, failing to achieve a comprehensive and multi-grained video perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce UFVideo, the first Video LLM with unified multi-grained cooperative understanding capabilities. Specifically, we design unified visual-language guided alignment to flexibly handle video understanding across global, pixel and temporal scales within a single model. UFVideo dynamically encodes the visual and text inputs of different tasks and generates the textual response, temporal localization, or grounded mask. Additionally, to evaluate challenging multi-grained video understanding tasks, we construct the UFVideo-Bench consisting of three distinct collaborative tasks within the scales, which demonstrates UFVideo's flexibility and advantages over GPT-4o. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our model across 9 public benchmarks covering various common video understanding tasks, providing valuable insights for future Video LLMs.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Underwater pipelines are highly susceptible to corrosion, which not only shorten their service life but also pose significant safety risks. Compared with manual inspection, the intelligent real-time imaging system for underwater pipeline detection has become a more reliable and practical solution. Among various underwater imaging techniques, structured light 3D imaging can restore the sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization. Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification. To overcome the challenges of extrinsic calibration among underwater sensors, a factor graph-based parameter optimization method is proposed to estimate the transformation matrix between the structured light and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, a multi-mode 3D imaging strategy is introduced to adapt to the geometric variability of underwater pipelines. Given the presence of numerous disturbances in underwater environments, a multi-source information fusion strategy and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) are designed to ensure stable pose estimation and high-accuracy measurements. In particular, an edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates pipeline edge detection network with enhanced point cloud registration to achieve robust and high-fidelity reconstruction of defect structures even under variable motion conditions. Extensive experiments are conducted under different operation modes, velocities, and depths. The results demonstrate that the developed system achieves superior accuracy, adaptability and robustness, providing a solid foundation for autonomous underwater pipeline detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从单目RGB视频进行动态场景重建的自动流程，通过增强Dynamic Gaussian Splatting的先验，提升重建质量和渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目动态场景重建方法在处理细薄结构、深度一致性和运动连贯性等方面存在不足，需要更可靠的先验指导来提升重建质量。

Method: 结合视频分割和极线误差图生成物体级掩码，指导对象深度损失优化视频深度；采用基于骨架的采样和掩码引导的重新识别获得全面的2D轨迹；增加虚拟视图深度损失消除漂浮物，以及支架投影损失将运动节点与轨迹绑定。

Result: 该算法在单目动态场景重建方面超越了先前方法，并生成视觉上更优的渲染结果。

Conclusion: 通过引入增强的先验指导和新的损失函数，成功提升了动态场景重建的准确性和渲染质量，为单目视频的动态重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured monocular RGB videos. Rather than designing a new scene representation, we enhance the priors that drive Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Video segmentation combined with epipolar-error maps yields object-level masks that closely follow thin structures; these masks (i) guide an object-depth loss that sharpens the consistent video depth, and (ii) support skeleton-based sampling plus mask-guided re-identification to produce reliable, comprehensive 2-D tracks. Two additional objectives embed the refined priors in the reconstruction stage: a virtual-view depth loss removes floaters, and a scaffold-projection loss ties motion nodes to the tracks, preserving fine geometry and coherent motion. The resulting system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings

Abstract: Efficient crop detection via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for scaling precision agriculture, yet it remains challenging due to the small scale of targets and environmental variability. This paper addresses the detection of rice seedlings in paddy fields by leveraging a Faster R-CNN architecture initialized via transfer learning. To overcome the specific difficulties of detecting minute objects in high-resolution aerial imagery, we curate a significant UAV dataset for training and rigorously evaluate the model's generalization capabilities. Specifically, we validate performance across three distinct test sets acquired at different temporal intervals, thereby assessing robustness against varying imaging conditions. Our empirical results demonstrate that transfer learning not only facilitates the rapid convergence of object detection models in agricultural contexts but also yields consistent performance despite domain shifts in image acquisition.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve superior performance in semantic segmentation, but are limited to a predefined set of classes, which leads to failures when they encounter unknown objects in open-world scenarios. Recognizing and segmenting these out-of-distribution (OOD) objects is crucial for safety-critical applications such as automated driving. In this work, we present an evidence segmentation framework using a Wasserstein loss, which captures distributional distances while respecting the probability simplex geometry. Combined with Kullback-Leibler regularization and Dice structural consistency terms, our approach leads to improved OOD segmentation performance compared to uncertainty-based approaches.

Abstract: Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.

Abstract: With the surge of pre-trained text-to-image flow matching models, text-based image editing performance has gained remarkable improvement, especially for \underline{simple editing} that only contains a single editing target. To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench. On two benchmarks, FlowDC shows superior results compared with existing methods. We also detail the ablations of our module designs.

Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

Conclusion: JoyAvatar通过创新的渐进引导、条件注入和动态位置编码技术，成功实现了音频驱动的实时无限长视频生成，为头像视频合成领域提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

Abstract: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24\% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, which we apply to YawDD, enabling more accurate model training. Training the established MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector architectures on YawDD+ improves frame accuracy by up to 6\% and mAP by 5\% over video-level supervision, achieving 99.34\% classification accuracy and 95.69\% detection mAP. The resulting approach deliver up to 59.8 FPS on edge AI hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano), confirming that enhanced data quality alone supports on-device yawning monitoring without server-side computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.

Abstract: A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model encodes an object in two coupled forms: a parametric construction sequence and its resulting visible geometric shape. During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于多帧时序信息融合的深度学习模型，用于提升冰川崩解前缘在SAR图像中的自动检测精度，特别是在处理受海冰混杂区和雪覆盖面等季节性因素干扰时的表现。


<details>

Motivation: 海洋冰川崩解前缘的持续变化显著影响着冰川质量和动力学，需要连续监测。现有的深度学习模型在合成孔径雷达图像中自动描绘崩解前缘时，常难以准确分类受季节性条件（如海冰混杂区或雪覆盖面）影响的区域。

Method: 提出并行处理同一冰川的卫星图像时间序列中的多帧，并在对应特征图之间交换时序信息以稳定每个预测。该方法被整合到当前最先进的Tyrion架构中。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上实现了新的最先进性能：平均距离误差184.4米，平均交并比83.6%。

Conclusion: 通过利用多帧时序信息融合的方法，显著提升了冰川崩解前缘在SAR图像中的自动检测精度，特别是在处理季节性干扰因素方面表现优异。

Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

Abstract: Abutment design is a critical step in dental implant restoration. However, manual design involves tedious measurement and fitting, and research on automating this process with AI is limited, due to the unavailability of large annotated datasets. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate data scarcity, its need for pre-training and fine-tuning results in high computational costs and long training times. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised assisted automatic abutment design framework (SS$A^3$D), which employs a dual-branch architecture with a reconstruction branch and a regression branch. The reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scan data and transfers the learned structural information to the regression branch. The regression branch then predicts the abutment parameters under supervised learning, which eliminates the separate pre-training and fine-tuning process. We also design a Text-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module to incorporate clinical information (such as implant location, system, and series) into SS$A^3$D. This guides the network to focus on relevant regions and constrains the parameter predictions. Extensive experiments on a collected dataset show that SS$A^3$D saves half of the training time and achieves higher accuracy than traditional SSL methods. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods, significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of automated abutment design.

TL;DR: VGGT作为3D基础模型，通过单次前向传播推断相机几何和场景结构，研究通过系统分析揭示其内部机制：在全局注意力层中隐式执行对应点匹配并编码极线几何，表明模型内部实现了几何理解，同时利用了学习到的数据驱动先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨VGGT模型的几何理解机制——该模型是在大规模数据集上以监督单步方式训练的，需要明确其功能实现是依赖传统多视图方法的几何概念，还是主要基于学习到的外观数据驱动先验。

Method: 1) 通过探测中间特征、分析注意力模式和执行干预来分析模型内部表示；2) 通过空间输入掩码和扰动实验评估模型对遮挡、外观变化和相机配置的鲁棒性；3) 与经典多阶段流程进行对比分析。

Result: 研究发现VGGT在没有显式几何约束训练的情况下，在其全局注意力层中隐式执行对应点匹配并编码极线几何。此外，模型在适应遮挡和处理外观变化方面表现出鲁棒性，同时验证了学习到的数据驱动先验在几何推理中的重要作用。

Conclusion: VGGT通过内部化几何结构实现其功能，同时有效利用学习到的数据驱动先验，这表明现代基于注意力的Transformer架构能够从数据中隐式学习复杂的几何关系，即使在没有显式几何建模的情况下。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Abstract: Integrating event cameras with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promises general scene understanding in challenging visual conditions, yet requires navigating a trade-off between preserving the unique advantages of event data and ensuring compatibility with frame-based models. We address this challenge by using reconstruction as a bridge, proposing a straightforward Frame-based Reconstruction and Tokenization (FRT) method and designing an efficient Adaptive Reconstruction and Tokenization (ART) method that leverages event sparsity. For robust evaluation, we introduce EvQA, the first objective, real-world benchmark for event-based MLLMs, comprising 1,000 event-Q&A pairs from 22 public datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on EvQA, highlighting the significant potential of MLLMs in event-based vision.

Abstract: Fine-scale forest monitoring is essential for understanding canopy structure and its dynamics, which are key indicators of carbon stocks, biodiversity, and forest health. Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data.

Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.

TL;DR: 本文通过T2I-CompBench++和GenEval基准首次系统评估了视觉自回归与扩散模型在文本到图像生成中的组合对齐能力，发现Infinity-8B表现最佳，VAR模型在某些任务上甚至超越更大的扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本描述（物体、属性和空间关系）与生成图像之间的组合对齐仍是现代文本到图像（T2I）模型的核心挑战。扩散架构已被广泛研究，但新兴视觉自回归（VAR）模型的组合行为尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 评估六个T2I系统（SDXL, PixArt-α, Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Infinity-2B, Infinity-8B），基于T2I-CompBench++和GenEval基准测试，衡量颜色与属性绑定、空间关系、计数和复杂多对象提示的对齐度。

Result: Infinity-8B在两个基准测试中总体组合对齐表现最强；Infinity-2B在多个类别上匹配或超过更大的扩散模型，体现出较好的效率-性能平衡；而SDXL和PixArt-α在属性敏感和空间任务上持续表现薄弱。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统比较了VAR与扩散模型在组合对齐方面的表现，为T2I模型的未来发展建立了统一基准，并揭示了VAR模型在组合对齐任务上的优势及效率-性能平衡潜力。

Abstract: Achieving compositional alignment between textual descriptions and generated images - covering objects, attributes, and spatial relationships - remains a core challenge for modern text-to-image (T2I) models. Although diffusion-based architectures have been widely studied, the compositional behavior of emerging Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models is still largely unexamined. We benchmark six diverse T2I systems - SDXL, PixArt-$α$, Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Infinity-2B, and Infinity-8B - across the full T2I-CompBench++ and GenEval suites, evaluating alignment in color and attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy, and complex multi-object prompts. Across both benchmarks, Infinity-8B achieves the strongest overall compositional alignment, while Infinity-2B also matches or exceeds larger diffusion models in several categories, highlighting favorable efficiency-performance trade-offs. In contrast, SDXL and PixArt-$α$ show persistent weaknesses in attribute-sensitive and spatial tasks. These results provide the first systematic comparison of VAR and diffusion approaches to compositional alignment and establish unified baselines for the future development of the T2I model.

Abstract: We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning based models in medical image segmentation, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods perform fully-supervised learning, which commonly rely on large scale annotated training datasets. However, medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering its clinical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been emerged as an appealing strategy in training with limited annotations, largely reducing the labelling cost. We propose a novel SSL framework SSL-MedSAM2, which contains a training-free few-shot learning branch TFFS-MedSAM2 based on the pretrained large foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for pseudo label generation, and an iterative fully-supervised learning branch FSL-nnUNet based on nnUNet for pseudo label refinement. The results on MICCAI2025 challenge CARE-LiSeg (Liver Segmentation) demonstrate an outstanding performance of SSL-MedSAM2 among other methods. The average dice scores on the test set in GED4 and T1 MRI are 0.9710 and 0.9648 respectively, and the Hausdorff distances are 20.07 and 21.97 respectively.

Abstract: 3D teeth segmentation, involving the localization of tooth instances and their semantic categorization in 3D dental models, is a critical yet challenging task in digital dentistry due to the complexity of real-world dentition. In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process. Our method has been validated on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark, achieving an IoU of 91.90% on high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the field.

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream finetuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no finetuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Conclusion: ContextSeisNet为地震多次波衰减提供了一种实用的空间一致性处理方法，并有望推广到其他地震处理任务中。

Abstract: Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents adopt an end-to-end paradigm that maps a screenshot to an action sequence, thereby automating repetitive tasks in virtual environments. However, existing GUI agents are evaluated almost exclusively on commodity software such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Professional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) suites promise an order-of-magnitude higher economic return, yet remain the weakest performance domain for existing agents and are still far from replacing expert Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) engineers. We therefore present the first systematic study that deploys GUI agents for EDA workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale dataset named GUI-EDA, including 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains, comprising 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA scientists and engineers during real-world component design; (2) a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, demonstrating that EDA tasks constitute a major, unsolved challenge; and (3) an EDA-specialized metric named EDAgent, equipped with a reflection mechanism that achieves reliable performance on industrial CAD software and, for the first time, outperforms Ph.D. students majored in Electrical Engineering. This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains and offers a new avenue for advancing EDA productivity.

Abstract: Image Compression for Machines (ICM) has emerged as a pivotal research direction in the field of visual data compression. However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI.

TL;DR: FactorPortrait是一种视频扩散方法，用于可控的肖像动画，能够从分离的面部表情、头部运动和相机视角控制信号生成逼真的合成效果。

Motivation: 现有的肖像动画方法通常难以同时控制面部表情、头部姿态和相机视角，且缺乏从单一图像生成高质量动画的能力。

Method: 使用预训练图像编码器从驱动视频提取面部表情潜在向量作为控制信号，通过提出的表情控制器注入视频扩散Transformer；采用Plücker射线图和法线图控制相机和头部姿态；构建大规模合成数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法在真实性、表现力、控制精度和视角一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FactorPortrait通过分离的控制信号实现了高质量的肖像动画，在单图像驱动的动画生成方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: We introduce FactorPortrait, a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that enables lifelike synthesis from disentangled control signals of facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints. Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

Abstract: The acquisition cost for large, annotated motion datasets remains a critical bottleneck for skeletal-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

Conclusion: CLV-Net为多模态遥感图像理解提供了有效的视觉提示引导框架，能更好地处理视觉相似对象并捕捉丰富的对象间关系，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in image understanding have enabled methods that leverage large language models for multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results. The model effectively captures user intent and produces precise, intention-aligned multimodal outputs.

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 该设备通过端到端的工作流程，有效解决了实际场景中的文本图像分类问题，在不同成像条件下都能实现高精度的混合来源文本分类。

Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.

Abstract: Recent pose-to-video models can translate 2D pose sequences into photorealistic, identity-preserving dance videos, so the key challenge is to generate temporally coherent, rhythm-aligned 2D poses from music, especially under complex, high-variance in-the-wild distributions. We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

Abstract: We present a weak to strong generalization methodology for fully automated training of a multi-head extension of the Mask-RCNN method with efficient channel attention for reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent (IF) whole-slide images (WSI), and present evidence for pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, the key phenomena underlying weak to strong generalization. This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.

Abstract: Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

Motivation: 在标签稀缺的环境下（如细胞计数任务），生成真实的合成显微图像对训练深度学习模型至关重要。传统的域自适应方法在处理合成图像缺乏真实样本复杂纹理和视觉模式时往往难以弥合域差距。

Conclusion: InST风格迁移能有效缩小合成与真实显微数据之间的域差距，为增强细胞计数性能同时最小化人工标注工作提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

Abstract: Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.

Abstract: Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

Motivation: 现有的大规模视频生成模型虽然能建模光照真实的外观和光照交互，但缺乏能够联合理解场景本质属性（如反照率、法线、材质和辐照度）、利用这些属性进行视频合成、并支持可编辑本质表示的闭环框架

Conclusion: V-RGBX是首个端到端的本质感知视频编辑框架，通过统一视频逆渲染、合成和编辑，实现了基于本质表示的直观、物理基础视频编辑，为视频编辑提供了新的可能性和更强的控制能力

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.

Conclusion: 通过统计矩表征密度分布及连续透射率重建，成功弥补了栅格化渲染与物理准确性之间的差距，为高质量半透明物体渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly used to document clinical encounters, yet its reliability in multilingual and demographically diverse Indian healthcare contexts remains largely unknown. In this study, we conduct the first systematic audit of ASR performance on real world clinical interview data spanning Kannada, Hindi, and Indian English, comparing leading models including Indic Whisper, Whisper, Sarvam, Google speech to text, Gemma3n, Omnilingual, Vaani, and Gemini. We evaluate transcription accuracy across languages, speakers, and demographic subgroups, with a particular focus on error patterns affecting patients vs. clinicians and gender based or intersectional disparities. Our results reveal substantial variability across models and languages, with some systems performing competitively on Indian English but failing on code mixed or vernacular speech. We also uncover systematic performance gaps tied to speaker role and gender, raising concerns about equitable deployment in clinical settings. By providing a comprehensive multilingual benchmark and fairness analysis, our work highlights the need for culturally and demographically inclusive ASR development for healthcare ecosystem in India.

Large pre-trained systems such as Whisper, XLS-R, MMS, and W2v-BERT have expanded access to ASR technology, but their comparative behavior in African low-resource contexts has not been studied in a unified and systematic way. In this work, we benchmark four state-of-the-art ASR models across 13 African languages, fine-tuning them on progressively larger subsets of transcribed data ranging from 1 to 400 hours. Beyond reporting error rates, we provide new insights into why models behave differently under varying conditions. We show that MMS and W2v-BERT are more data efficient in very low-resource regimes, XLS-R scales more effectively as additional data becomes available, and Whisper demonstrates advantages in mid-resource conditions. We also analyze where external language model decoding yields improvements and identify cases where it plateaus or introduces additional errors, depending on the alignment between acoustic and text resources. By highlighting the interaction between pre-training coverage, model architecture, dataset domain, and resource availability, this study offers practical and insights into the design of ASR systems for underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Recent advancements in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have significantly enhanced the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform complex question-answering (QA) tasks. In this paper, we introduce MedBioRAG, a retrieval-augmented model designed to improve biomedical QA performance through a combination of semantic and lexical search, document retrieval, and supervised fine-tuning. MedBioRAG efficiently retrieves and ranks relevant biomedical documents, enabling precise and context-aware response generation. We evaluate MedBioRAG across text retrieval, close-ended QA, and long-form QA tasks using benchmark datasets such as NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, MedQA, PubMedQA, and BioASQ. Experimental results demonstrate that MedBioRAG outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) models and the GPT-4o base model in all evaluated tasks. Notably, our approach improves NDCG and MRR scores for document retrieval, while achieving higher accuracy in close-ended QA and ROUGE scores in long-form QA. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of semantic search-based retrieval and LLM fine-tuning in biomedical applications.

TL;DR: KBQA-R1 框架使用強化學習將知識庫問答從文本模仿轉變為互動優化，通過分組相對策略優化和參考拒絕採樣方法，在三個基準數據集上實現了最先進性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有的基於大語言模型的知識庫問答方法存在兩種失敗模式：要麼生成虛幻查詢而不驗證模式存在性，要麼表現出僵化的模板推理而缺乏對環境的真正理解。需要一個能將推理與可驗證執行相結合的新範式。

Method: 提出 KBQA-R1 框架，將 KBQA 建模為多輪決策過程，使用分組相對策略優化（GRPO）基於執行反饋學習導航知識庫，並引入參考拒絕採樣（RRS）解決冷啟動問題。

Result: 在 WebQSP、GrailQA 和 GraphQuestions 三個基準數據集上的廣泛實驗表明，KBQA-R1 實現了最先進的性能，有效將大語言模型推理置於可驗證的執行基礎上。

Conclusion: KBQA-R1 通過強化學習將問答過程從文本模仿轉向互動優化，結合 GRPO 和 RRS 方法，成功解決了現有方法的局限性，為知識庫問答提供了更可靠且可驗證的解決方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) challenges models to bridge the gap between natural language and strict knowledge graph schemas by generating executable logical forms. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced this field, current approaches often struggle with a dichotomy of failure: they either generate hallucinated queries without verifying schema existence or exhibit rigid, template-based reasoning that mimics synthesized traces without true comprehension of the environment. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{KBQA-R1}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from text imitation to interaction optimization via Reinforcement Learning. Treating KBQA as a multi-turn decision process, our model learns to navigate the knowledge base using a list of actions, leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine its strategies based on concrete execution feedback rather than static supervision. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS)}, a data synthesis method that resolves cold-start challenges by strictly aligning reasoning traces with ground-truth action sequences. Extensive experiments on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions demonstrate that KBQA-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively grounding LLM reasoning in verifiable execution.

*Christopher Driggers-Ellis,Detravious Brinkley,Ray Chen,Aashish Dhawan,Daisy Zhe Wang,Christan Grant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MultiScript30k数据集，将Multi30k扩展到阿拉伯语、西班牙语、乌克兰语、简体中文和繁体中文，以促进多模态机器翻译研究在更多语言和文字上的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi30k数据集目前只包含捷克语、英语、法语和德语这四种语言，且全部是拉丁字母的欧洲语言，这限制了多模态机器翻译研究在其他语言和文字上的发展。为了解决这个问题，需要将Multi30k扩展到更多全球语言和不同文字上。

Method: 使用NLLB200-3.3B模型将Multi30k的英文版本（Multi30k-En）翻译成阿拉伯语（Ar）、西班牙语（Es）、乌克兰语（Uk）、简体中文（Zh_Hans）和繁体中文（Zh_Hant），创建了包含超过30000个句子的MultiScript30k数据集。

Result: 相似性分析显示，除了繁体中文外，所有语言都达到了大于0.8的余弦相似度和小于0.000251的对称KL散度，与之前的扩展数据集表现相当。COMETKiwi评估显示混合结果：阿拉伯语版本与现有扩展相当，但乌克兰语版本比现有扩展低了6.4%。

Conclusion: MultiScript30k成功将Multi30k扩展到更多全球语言和文字，为多模态机器翻译研究提供了更丰富的语言资源，虽然在特定语言的翻译质量评估中表现不一，但整体上为领域研究提供了有价值的扩展数据集。

Abstract: Multi30k is frequently cited in the multimodal machine translation (MMT) literature, offering parallel text data for training and fine-tuning deep learning models. However, it is limited to four languages: Czech, English, French, and German. This restriction has led many researchers to focus their investigations only on these languages. As a result, MMT research on diverse languages has been stalled because the official Multi30k dataset only represents European languages in Latin scripts. Previous efforts to extend Multi30k exist, but the list of supported languages, represented language families, and scripts is still very short. To address these issues, we propose MultiScript30k, a new Multi30k dataset extension for global languages in various scripts, created by translating the English version of Multi30k (Multi30k-En) using NLLB200-3.3B. The dataset consists of over \(30000\) sentences and provides translations of all sentences in Multi30k-En into Ar, Es, Uk, Zh\_Hans and Zh\_Hant. Similarity analysis shows that Multi30k extension consistently achieves greater than \(0.8\) cosine similarity and symmetric KL divergence less than \(0.000251\) for all languages supported except Zh\_Hant which is comparable to the previous Multi30k extensions ArEnMulti30k and Multi30k-Uk. COMETKiwi scores reveal mixed assessments of MultiScript30k as a translation of Multi30k-En in comparison to the related work. ArEnMulti30k scores nearly equal MultiScript30k-Ar, but Multi30k-Uk scores $6.4\%$ greater than MultiScript30k-Uk per split.

Motivation: 随着社会对短格式电子通信的依赖加深，用户消息数据的隐私和利用价值值得关注。苹果iMessage在Mac上本地存储所有消息和元数据，为个人数据分析创造了机会。

Method: 作者开发了一个iMessage文本消息分析器，针对五个主要研究问题：话题建模、回复时间、不情愿度评分和情感分析，通过分析本地存储的数据文件实现。

Conclusion: 该分析工具为iMessage数据研究打开了新途径，展现了个人消息数据分析在未来的应用潜力，使用户能够更好地理解自己的通信模式。

Abstract: What is your messaging data used for? While many users do not often think about the information companies can gather based off of their messaging platform of choice, it is nonetheless important to consider as society increasingly relies on short-form electronic communication. While most companies keep their data closely guarded, inaccessible to users or potential hackers, Apple has opened a door to their walled-garden ecosystem, providing iMessage users on Mac with one file storing all their messages and attached metadata. With knowledge of this locally stored file, the question now becomes: What can our data do for us? In the creation of our iMessage text message analyzer, we set out to answer five main research questions focusing on topic modeling, response times, reluctance scoring, and sentiment analysis. This paper uses our exploratory data to show how these questions can be answered using our analyzer and its potential in future studies on iMessage data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种模型和方法无关的评估框架，通过三个指标量化特征归因方法的词汇和位置偏差，揭示了不同模型在不同偏差类型上的结构性不平衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前特征归因方法（如Integrated Gradient）存在明显的解释不一致问题。用户可能意识到这种不一致性而产生不信任，或不了解该问题的用户可能过度信任这些解释。需要超越表面不一致性，结构化地分析这些方法的偏差。

Method: 提出了一个模型和方法无关的评估框架，包含三个评估指标。在两种任务上系统评估词汇和位置偏差：1）人工数据上的受控伪随机分类任务；2）自然数据上的半受控因果关系检测任务。研究了两种Transformer模型的方法偏差。

Result: 发现词汇和位置偏差在模型比较中存在结构性不平衡——在一种偏差类型上得分高的模型，在另一种类型上往往得分低。还发现产生异常解释的方法更可能有偏差。

Conclusion: 该框架能够结构化地分析特征归因方法的偏差，揭示了不同偏差类型之间的权衡关系，为理解和改进解释方法提供了系统化工具。

Abstract: Good quality explanations strengthen the understanding of language models and data. Feature attribution methods, such as Integrated Gradient, are a type of post-hoc explainer that can provide token-level insights. However, explanations on the same input may vary greatly due to underlying biases of different methods. Users may be aware of this issue and mistrust their utility, while unaware users may trust them inadequately. In this work, we delve beyond the superficial inconsistencies between attribution methods, structuring their biases through a model- and method-agnostic framework of three evaluation metrics. We systematically assess both the lexical and position bias (what and where in the input) for two transformers; first, in a controlled, pseudo-random classification task on artificial data; then, in a semi-controlled causal relation detection task on natural data. We find that lexical and position biases are structurally unbalanced in our model comparison, with models that score high on one type score low on the other. We also find signs that methods producing anomalous explanations are more likely to be biased themselves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单实体事实和单语言数据，缺乏对多实体设置和多语言环境的系统性评估，因此需要开发更全面的基准以评估大语言模型的事实可靠性和偏差。

Method: 构建FIBER多语言基准数据集，包含英语、意大利语和土耳其语的句子补全、问答和对象计数预测任务，用于测试模型在单实体和多实体情境下的表现，并分析提示语言对推断偏差的影响。

Result: 提示语言会影响模型输出，特别是与语言对应国家相关的实体；在83%的主题中土耳其提示比意大利语提示偏差更高；多实体问题比单实体问题更困难；英语任务的平均精度最高，大模型如Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B表现优于小模型。

Conclusion: 开发了FIBER基准，揭示了提示语言对模型推断存在偏差影响，且多实体问题更具挑战性，模型性能和偏差存在语言与模型规模差异，为未来多语言事实性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large language models are widely used across domains, yet there are concerns about their factual reliability and biases. Factual knowledge probing offers a systematic means to evaluate these aspects. Most existing benchmarks focus on single-entity facts and monolingual data. We therefore present FIBER, a multilingual benchmark for evaluating factual knowledge in single- and multi-entity settings. The dataset includes sentence completion, question-answering, and object-count prediction tasks in English, Italian, and Turkish. Using FIBER, we examine whether the prompt language induces inference bias in entity selection and how large language models perform on multi-entity versus single-entity questions. The results indicate that the language of the prompt can influence the model's generated output, particularly for entities associated with the country corresponding to that language. However, this effect varies across different topics such that 31% of the topics exhibit factual inference bias score greater than 0.5. Moreover, the level of bias differs across languages such that Turkish prompts show higher bias compared to Italian in 83% of the topics, suggesting a language-dependent pattern. Our findings also show that models face greater difficulty when handling multi-entity questions than the single-entity questions. Model performance differs across both languages and model sizes. The highest mean average precision is achieved in English, while Turkish and Italian lead to noticeably lower scores. Larger models, including Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, show consistently better performance than smaller 3B-4B models.

Abstract: Multi-intent spoken language understanding (SLU) involves two tasks: multiple intent detection and slot filling, which jointly handle utterances containing more than one intent. Owing to this characteristic, which closely reflects real-world applications, the task has attracted increasing research attention, and substantial progress has been achieved. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review of existing studies on multi-intent SLU. To this end, this paper presents a survey of recent advances in multi-intent SLU. We provide an in-depth overview of previous research from two perspectives: decoding paradigms and modeling approaches. On this basis, we further compare the performance of representative models and analyze their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and outline promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will offer valuable insights and serve as a useful reference for advancing research in multi-intent SLU.

Abstract: Systematic reviews are a key component of evidence-based medicine, playing a critical role in synthesizing existing research evidence and guiding clinical decisions. However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法需要额外训练、超参数调优或对模型和任务进行先验分析，限制了实用性和部署效率

Method: 引入两个自适应阈值：一个基于标记熵决定何时停止候选标记生成，另一个基于Jensen-Shannon距离决定标记接受，两者在推理过程中实时更新

Result: 在基准数据集上实验显示，AdaSD比标准推测解码实现了最高49%的加速，同时保持准确率下降在2%以内

Conclusion: AdaSD是一种实用的、自适应的LLM推理解决方案，兼容现成模型，无需先验分析或微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks, but their increasing parameter sizes significantly slow down inference. Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49\% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2\%, making it a practical solution for efficient and adaptive LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长而嘈杂的检索上下文时经常产生幻觉，因为它们依赖虚假相关性而非真正的因果关系。

Method: CIP构造实体、动作和事件之间的因果序列并将其注入提示中，通过因果干预和反事实推理来抑制非因果推理路径。

Result: 在包括GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash和Llama 3.1在内的七个主流语言模型上，CIP将可归因率提高了2.6个点，因果一致性得分提高了0.38，有效信息密度增加了四倍，并降低了55.1%的端到端响应延迟。

Conclusion: 因果推理可能是提高大语言模型可解释性、稳定性和效率的有前途范式。

Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate when processing long and noisy retrieval contexts because they rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships. We propose CIP, a lightweight and plug-and-play causal prompting framework that mitigates hallucinations at the input stage. CIP constructs a causal relation sequence among entities, actions, and events and injects it into the prompt to guide reasoning toward causally relevant evidence. Through causal intervention and counterfactual reasoning, CIP suppresses non causal reasoning paths, improving factual grounding and interpretability. Experiments across seven mainstream language models, including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Llama 3.1, show that CIP consistently enhances reasoning quality and reliability, achieving 2.6 points improvement in Attributable Rate, 0.38 improvement in Causal Consistency Score, and a fourfold increase in effective information density. API level profiling further shows that CIP accelerates contextual understanding and reduces end to end response latency by up to 55.1 percent. These results suggest that causal reasoning may serve as a promising paradigm for improving the explainability, stability, and efficiency of large language models.

Abstract: This paper introduces LegalRikai: Open Benchmark, a new benchmark comprising four complex tasks that emulate Japanese corporate legal practices. The benchmark was created by legal professionals under the supervision of an attorney. This benchmark has 100 samples that require long-form, structured outputs, and we evaluated them against multiple practical criteria. We conducted both human and automated evaluations using leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.1. Our human evaluation revealed that abstract instructions prompted unnecessary modifications, highlighting model weaknesses in document-level editing that were missed by conventional short-text tasks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that automated evaluation aligns well with human judgment on criteria with clear linguistic grounding, and assessing structural consistency remains a challenge. The result demonstrates the utility of automated evaluation as a screening tool when expert availability is limited. We propose a dataset evaluation framework to promote more practice-oriented research in the legal domain.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models for specialized tasks often requires domain-specific parameter-efficient finetuning through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules. However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.

Abstract: Courts must justify their decisions, but systematically analyzing judicial reasoning at scale remains difficult. This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability. Empirically, we challenge prevailing narratives about CEE formalism. This work shows that legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification and shows the potential of legal argument mining for other important tasks in computational legal studies. Our methodology is easily replicable across jurisdictions, and our entire pipeline, datasets, guidelines, models, and source codes are available at https://github.com/trusthlt/madon.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.

Abstract: Integrating language models (LMs) in healthcare systems holds great promise for improving medical workflows and decision-making. However, a critical barrier to their real-world adoption is the lack of reliable evaluation of their trustworthiness, especially in multilingual healthcare settings. Existing LMs are predominantly trained in high-resource languages, making them ill-equipped to handle the complexity and diversity of healthcare queries in mid- and low-resource languages, posing significant challenges for deploying them in global healthcare contexts where linguistic diversity is key. In this work, we present CLINIC, a Comprehensive Multilingual Benchmark to evaluate the trustworthiness of language models in healthcare. CLINIC systematically benchmarks LMs across five key dimensions of trustworthiness: truthfulness, fairness, safety, robustness, and privacy, operationalized through 18 diverse tasks, spanning 15 languages (covering all the major continents), and encompassing a wide array of critical healthcare topics like disease conditions, preventive actions, diagnostic tests, treatments, surgeries, and medications. Our extensive evaluation reveals that LMs struggle with factual correctness, demonstrate bias across demographic and linguistic groups, and are susceptible to privacy breaches and adversarial attacks. By highlighting these shortcomings, CLINIC lays the foundation for enhancing the global reach and safety of LMs in healthcare across diverse languages.

Abstract: We present a new Hebrew medical language model designed to extract structured clinical timelines from electronic health records, enabling the construction of patient journeys. Our model is based on DictaBERT 2.0 and continually pre-trained on over five million de-identified hospital records. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce two new datasets -- one from internal medicine and emergency departments, and another from oncology -- annotated for event temporal relations. Our results show that our model achieves strong performance on both datasets. We also find that vocabulary adaptation improves token efficiency and that de-identification does not compromise downstream performance, supporting privacy-conscious model development. The model is made available for research use under ethical restrictions.

Conclusion: 研究结果为科学应用中选择适当的幻觉减少方法提供指导，强调在事实准确性和创造性探索之间平衡的重要性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, but suffer from hallucination: the generation of factually incorrect content. While numerous methods have been developed to reduce hallucinations, their impact on creative generations remains unexplored. This gap is particularly critical for AI-assisted scientific discovery, which requires both factual accuracy and creative hypothesis generation. We investigate how three hallucination-reduction techniques: Chain of Verification (CoVe), Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), affect creativity in LLMs. Evaluating multiple model families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral) at varying scales (1B - 70B parameters) on two creativity benchmarks (NeoCoder and CS4), we find that these methods have opposing effects on divergent creativity. CoVe enhances divergent thinking, DoLa suppresses it, and RAG shows minimal impact. Our findings provide guidance for selecting appropriate hallucination-reduction methods in scientific applications, where the balance between factual accuracy and creative exploration is crucial.

Abstract: We consider the problem of auditing black-box large language models (LLMs) to ensure they behave reliably when deployed in production settings, particularly in high-stakes domains such as legal, medical, and regulatory compliance. Existing approaches for LLM auditing often focus on isolated aspects of model behavior, such as detecting specific biases or evaluating fairness. We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how DBSA can enable users to inspect LLM inputs and find sensitivities that may be overlooked by existing LLM interpretability methods.

Conclusion: 自主交互式证明监督为可靠RAG系统提供了原则性和实践性路径，使检索文档不再仅仅是建议，而是可验证的证据

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models rely on retrieved evidence to guide large language model (LLM) generators, yet current systems treat retrieval as a weak heuristic rather than verifiable evidence. As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.

Result: 证明了每轮推测迭代成功预测令牌的期望数上界为$\mathbb{E}[X]\leq(μ+μ_{(2)})\log(P)/μ^2+O(1)$，其中P为验证器容量，μ为验证器输出分布的期望熵，μ_{(2)}为期望第二对数矩，经验评估验证了理论预测的紧致性。

Conclusion: 研究建立了推测生成的严格理论下界，揭示了并行令牌生成的固有限制，为未来推测解码系统的设计提供了指导，Llama模型上的实证结果确认了理论边界的实用性。

Abstract: Speculative generation has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate inference in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging parallelism to verify multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, the fundamental limits on the achievable speedup remain poorly understood. In this work, we establish the first ``tight'' lower bounds on the runtime of any deterministic speculative generation algorithm. This is achieved by drawing a parallel between the token generation process and branching random walks, which allows us to analyze the optimal draft tree selection problem. We prove, under basic assumptions, that the expected number of tokens successfully predicted per speculative iteration is bounded as $\mathbb{E}[X] \leq (μ+ μ_{(2)})\log(P )/μ^2 + O(1)$, where $P$ is the verifier's capacity, $μ$ is the expected entropy of the verifier's output distribution, and $μ_{(2)}$ is the expected second log-moment. This result provides new insights into the limits of parallel token generation, and could guide the design of future speculative decoding systems. Empirical evaluations on Llama models validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the tightness of our bounds in practical settings.

Abstract: Online product reviews contain rich but noisy signals that overwhelm users and hinder effective decision-making. Existing LLM-based summarizers remain generic and fail to account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility. We propose SUMFORU, a steerable review summarization framework that aligns outputs with explicit user personas to support personalized purchase decisions. Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories. Our results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems.

Abstract: In recommendation-driven online media, creators increasingly suffer from semantic mutation, where malicious secondary edits preserve visual fidelity while altering the intended meaning. Detecting these mutations requires modeling a creator's unique semantic manifold. However, training robust detector models for individual creators is challenged by data scarcity, as a distinct blogger may typically have fewer than 50 representative samples available for training. We propose quantum-enhanced blogger anomaly recognition (Q-BAR), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages the high expressivity and parameter efficiency of variational quantum circuits to detect semantic anomalies in low-data regimes. Unlike classical deep anomaly detectors that often struggle to generalize from sparse data, our method employs a parameter-efficient quantum anomaly detection strategy to map multimodal features into a Hilbert space hypersphere. On a curated dataset of 100 creators, our quantum-enhanced approach achieves robust detection performance with significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to classical baselines. By utilizing only hundreds of quantum parameters, the model effectively mitigates overfitting, demonstrating the potential of quantum machine learning for personalized media forensics.

Abstract: Effective mixed traffic control requires balancing efficiency, fairness, and safety. Existing approaches excel at optimizing efficiency and enforcing safety constraints but lack mechanisms to ensure equitable service, resulting in systematic starvation of vehicles on low-demand approaches. We propose a hierarchical framework combining multi-objective reinforcement learning for local intersection control with strategic routing for network-level coordination. Our approach introduces a Conflict Threat Vector that provides agents with explicit risk signals for proactive conflict avoidance, and a queue parity penalty that ensures equitable service across all traffic streams. Extensive experiments on a real-world network across different robot vehicle (RV) penetration rates demonstrate substantial improvements: up to 53% reductions in average wait time, up to 86% reductions in maximum starvation, and up to 86\% reduction in conflict rate compared to baselines, while maintaining fuel efficiency. Our analysis reveals that strategic routing effectiveness scales with RV penetration, becoming increasingly valuable at higher autonomy levels. The results demonstrate that multi-objective optimization through well-curated reward functions paired with strategic RV routing yields significant benefits in fairness and safety metrics critical for equitable mixed-autonomy deployment.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of cooperative resilience in multi-agent systems, defined as the ability to anticipate, resist, recover from, and transform to disruptive events that affect collective well-being. We focus on mixed-motive social dilemmas instantiated as a \textit{Tragedy of the Commons} environment from the Melting Pot suite, where we systematically compare human groups and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, each evaluated with and without explicit communication. Cooperative resilience is assessed under a continuously disruptive condition induced by a persistent unsustainable consumption bot, together with intermittent environmental shocks implemented as stochastic removal of shared resources across scenarios. This experimental design establishes a benchmark for cooperative resilience across agent architectures and interaction modalities, constituting a key step toward systematically comparing humans and LLM-based agents. Using this framework, we find that human groups with communication achieve the highest cooperative resilience compared to all other groups. Communication also improves the resilience of LLM agents, but their performance remains below human levels. Motivated by the performance of humans, we further examine a long-horizon setting with harsher environmental conditions, where humans sustain the shared resource and maintain high resilience in diverse disruption scenarios. Together, these results suggest that human decision-making under adverse social conditions can inform the design of artificial agents that promote prosocial and resilient behaviors.

Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.

Abstract: Online Freight Exchange Systems (OFEX) play a crucial role in modern freight logistics by facilitating real-time matching between shippers and carrier. However, efficient combinatorial bundling of transporation jobs remains a bottleneck. We model the OFEX combinatorial bundling problem as a multi-commodity one-to-one pickup-and-delivery selective traveling salesperson problem (m1-PDSTSP), which optimizes revenue-driven freight bundling under capacity, precedence, and route-length constraints. The key challenge is to couple combinatorial bundle selection with pickup-and-delivery routing under sub-second latency. We propose a learning--accelerated hybrid search pipeline that pairs a Transformer Neural Network-based constructive policy with an innovative Multi-Start Large Neighborhood Search (MSLNS) metaheuristic within a rolling-horizon scheme in which the platform repeatedly freezes the current marketplace into a static snapshot and solves it under a short time budget. This pairing leverages the low-latency, high-quality inference of the learning-based constructor alongside the robustness of improvement search; the multi-start design and plausible seeds help LNS to explore the solution space more efficiently. Across benchmarks, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural combinatorial optimization and metaheuristic baselines in solution quality with comparable time, achieving an optimality gap of less than 2\% in total revenue relative to the best available exact baseline method. To our knowledge, this is the first work to establish that a Deep Neural Network-based constructor can reliably provide high-quality seeds for (multi-start) improvement heuristics, with applicability beyond the \textit{m1-PDSTSP} to a broad class of selective traveling salesperson problems and pickup and delivery problems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world tasks requires converting informal descriptions into a formal Markov decision process (MDP), implementing an executable environment, and training a policy agent. Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.

Result: 在TravelPlanner和TripTailor基准测试中获得了最先进的结果，分别实现了91.1%和97%的最终通过率，运行效率比当前SOTA提高了10倍以上。

Conclusion: TriFlow通过渐进式多智能体框架有效解决了旅行规划中的约束满足和效率问题，在保持个性化的同时显著提升了可行性和性能。

Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.

Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型具备强大的推理和生成能力，但在多轮任务中，其行为往往缺乏可靠性和可验证性。为了提升LLM智能体在结构化环境中的可信赖行为，作者提出了一个整合行为指导的框架。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：1）轻量级任务分析器，用于选择推理和生成策略；2）推理模块，学习可验证的观察-动作映射；3）生成模块，通过验证或确定性合成来强制执行约束合规的输出。这三部分在智能体与环境交互过程中协同演化。

Result: 作者表明，随着智能体与环境交互，这三个组件能够协同演化，产生可信赖的行为。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将LLM智能体嵌入强化学习形式的环境，并结合行为指导机制，有效提升了智能体在结构化任务中的可靠性和可验证性，为解决LLM在多轮任务中的行为不可靠问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明常用的归因方法评估指标（插入/删除）存在基准选择偏差问题，不同的基准会偏好不同的归因方法，甚至导致矛盾结果。论文提出理想的基准应具备信息移除和不产生过度分布外样本的特性，但现有基准无法同时满足。作者引入基于特征可视化的模型依赖型新基准来改进这一权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 归因方法是可解释AI中最普遍的技术之一，通常使用保真度指标（如插入和删除）进行评估。这些指标依赖基准函数来改变输入图像中归因图认为最重要的像素。研究发现：基准的选择会不可避免地偏向某些归因方法，导致评估结果不一致，甚至线性模型也会因此产生矛盾结果。

Method: 通过两个理想属性研究基准选择问题：（1）移除信息的能力；（2）不产生过度分布外图像。分析了现有基准的局限性后，利用特征可视化技术提出新的模型依赖型基准，该基准能移除信息同时避免过度分布外问题。

Result: 实验表明，现有基准无一能同时满足两个理想标准，呈现明显的权衡关系——要么能移除信息，要么会产生分布外图像序列。新提出的基准在权衡方面优于现有基准，能更好地移除信息且不过度分布外。

Conclusion: 归因方法评估中基准选择存在系统偏差问题，需要开发能同时满足信息移除和分布内保持要求的新基准。提出的基于特征可视化的模型依赖型基准在这两个标准间取得了更好的平衡，为更公平的归因方法评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/Back-to-the-Baseline

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning, a 12.7B parameter language model designed to bridge the gap between open-weight systems and proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning and long-context understanding. Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No-Three-In-Line作为组合几何的经典问题，经典整数线性规划方法虽然能保证最优解但面临指数级扩展问题，机器学习方法为模式近似提供了有希望的替代方案。本研究旨在填补经典优化与AI方法在该问题上系统比较的空白。

Method: 首次应用PatternBoost transformer学习和强化学习（PPO）方法解决该问题，并与整数线性规划（ILP）进行对比。ILP作为经典优化方法，PatternBoost和PPO代表不同的AI方法。

Result: ILP在19×19网格内获得可证明的最优解；PatternBoost在14×14网格内达到最优性能，测试损失减少96%；PPO在10×10网格上获得完美解，但在11×11网格上因约束违规而失败。

Conclusion: 经典优化方法对于精确解仍然不可替代，AI方法在较小规模问题上具有竞争力，混合方法为解决更大规模问题提供了最有前景的方向。

Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential for democratizing scientific knowledge and converting this to clear, actionable information, yet its application in agri-food science remains unexplored. Here, we verify the scientific knowledge on agroecological crop protection that is generated by either web-grounded or non-grounded large language models (LLMs), i.e., DeepSeek versus the free-tier version of ChatGPT. For nine globally limiting pests, weeds, and plant diseases, we assessed the factual accuracy, data consistency, and breadth of knowledge or data completeness of each LLM. Overall, DeepSeek consistently screened a 4.8-49.7-fold larger literature corpus and reported 1.6-2.4-fold more biological control agents or management solutions than ChatGPT. As a result, DeepSeek reported 21.6% higher efficacy estimates, exhibited greater laboratory-to-field data consistency, and showed more realistic effects of pest identity and management tactics. However, both models hallucinated, i.e., fabricated fictitious agents or references, reported on implausible ecological interactions or outcomes, confused old and new scientific nomenclatures, and omitted data on key agents or solutions. Despite these shortcomings, both LLMs correctly reported low-resolution efficacy trends. Overall, when paired with rigorous human oversight, LLMs may pose a powerful tool to support farm-level decision-making and unleash scientific creativity.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.

Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.

Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.

Conclusion: 因果建模方法能有效捕捉能源需求的复杂因果机制，显著提升预测精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.

Abstract: Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/.

Abstract: Effective human-agent interaction (HAI) relies on accurate and adaptive perception of human emotional states. While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent. Our framework not only improves training efficiency but also contributes to the design of more flexible, scalable, and maintainable perception modules for embodied and virtual agents in HAI scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的RL框架能够实现脓毒症肝素治疗的可解释和稳健优化，连续cxSOFA评分和TECM评估提供了精细的治疗评估，有望改善临床结局和决策支持的可���性。

Abstract: Objective: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to acute organ dysfunction. This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining "good" or "bad" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness. Conclusion: The proposed RL framework enables interpretable and robust optimization of heparin therapy in surgical sepsis. Continuous cxSOFA scoring and TECM-based evaluation provide nuanced treatment assessment, showing promise for improving clinical outcomes and decision-support reliability.

Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network (NN) verifiers demonstrate that applying the branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure with fast bounding techniques plays a key role in tackling many challenging verification properties. In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $α,β$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner. Code available at https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/Clip_and_Verify.

TL;DR: 这项研究首次系统性地探索了偏标记学习(PLL)方法在心电图(ECG)诊断中的应用，通过多种临床启发的模糊标签生成策略评估了九种PLL算法，揭示了不同方法对各类标签模糊性的鲁棒性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界的心电图诊断存在固有的标签模糊性问题，源于重叠病症和诊断分歧，但现有模型都假设标签是干净无歧义的，这限制了模型的开发和实际应用评估。尽管偏标记学习框架旨在从模糊标签中学习，但其在ECG等医疗时间序列领域的有效性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 研究将九种偏标记学习算法适配到多标签ECG诊断任务中，使用多种临床启发的模糊性生成策略进行评估，包括非结构化(如随机)和结构化(如心脏病专家判定的相似性、治疗关系和诊断分类学)模糊性。实验在PTB-XL和Chapman数据集上进行。

Result: 实验表明，不同PLL方法对各种类型和程度的模糊性表现出显著不同的鲁棒性。通过深入分析，研究识别了当前PLL方法在临床环境中的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为ECG诊断领域偏标记学习的应用提供了首个系统性评估，并为开发鲁棒且符合临床需求的模糊性感知学习框架指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Label ambiguity is an inherent problem in real-world electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, arising from overlapping conditions and diagnostic disagreement. However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.

TL;DR: 测试时扩展（TTS）技术通过增加推理计算来提升大语言模型的推理能力，但在多模态系统中的系统性实证研究仍不足。本研究揭示，开源与闭源VLM对TTS方法的响应存在差异，且TTS效果高度依赖数据集特性，表明TTS并非通用解决方案，需要定制化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时扩展（TTS）在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示出强大潜力，但这种范式在视觉语言模型（VLM）等多模态系统中的应用尚未得到充分探索。需要系统地研究TTS方法在不同类型VLM和不同任务上的表现，以理解其适用范围和局限性。

Method: 对开源和闭源视觉语言模型在不同基准测试上，系统性地评估了推理时间推理方法的效果。主要考察了结构化推理、迭代自我优化（Self-Refinement）和外部验证等TTS技术，分析了它们在多步推理任务和感知主导任务中的性能变化。

Result: 结果显示：1）闭源模型能持续从结构化推理和迭代优化中获益；2）开源VLM表现不一致，外部验证提供最可靠增益，而迭代优化常导致性能下降；3）TTS有效性高度依赖数据集，多步推理任务有明显改进，感知主导任务收益有限。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展并非通用解决方案，其效果受模型能力和任务特性的共同影响。研究强调了需要针对具体模型和任务特征定制TTS策略，并指出未来工作应聚焦自适应TTS策略和多模态奖励模型的开发。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation at inference, yet its application to multimodal systems such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that TTS is not a universal solution and must be tailored to both model capabilities and task characteristics, motivating future work on adaptive TTS strategies and multimodal reward models.

Abstract: Balancing competing objectives is omnipresent across disciplines, from drug design to autonomous systems. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets. These results show that transformers can perform multi-objective optimization entirely in-context, eliminating per-task surrogate fitting and acquisition engineering, and open a path to foundation-style, plug-and-play optimizers for scientific discovery workflows.

Motivation: 在线优化中公平性和行动平滑性（切换成本）是两个重要但尚未同时解决的关键考量。传统方法在长期公平性正则化条件下难以实现次线性遗憾或有限竞争比

Method: 提出FairOBD算法，通过引入辅助变量将长期公平性成本分解为序列在线成本，并利用辅助变量正则化在线行动以促进公平结果。提出新方法处理切换成本

Result: 理论证明FairOBD针对参数化约束的最优离线算法提供最坏情况渐近竞争比（T→∞时）。实验显示FairOBD能有效降低总体公平性正则化成本并更好促进公平结果

Conclusion: FairOBD成功解决了公平性正则化平滑在线凸优化的挑战，在最小化命中成本、切换成本和公平性成本之间取得平衡，为负责任AI推断等应用提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Fairness and action smoothness are two crucial considerations in many online optimization problems, but they have yet to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\to\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for parameterizing physical fields, yet they often suffer from spectral bias and the computational expense of non-convex optimization. We introduce the Vekua Layer (VL), a differentiable spectral method grounded in the classical theory of Generalized Analytic Functions. By restricting the hypothesis space to the kernel of the governing differential operator -- specifically utilizing Harmonic and Fourier-Bessel bases -- the VL transforms the learning task from iterative gradient descent to a strictly convex least-squares problem solved via linear projection. We evaluate the VL against Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs) on homogeneous elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our results demonstrate that the VL achieves machine precision ($\text{MSE} \approx 10^{-33}$) on exact reconstruction tasks and exhibits superior stability in the presence of incoherent sensor noise ($\text{MSE} \approx 0.03$), effectively acting as a physics-informed spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the VL enables "holographic" extrapolation of global fields from partial boundary data via analytic continuation, a capability absent in standard coordinate-based approximations.

Abstract: Analyzing and visualizing scientific ensemble datasets with high dimensionality and complexity poses significant challenges. Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.

Abstract: Modern cities are increasingly reliant on data-driven insights to support decision making in areas such as transportation, public safety and environmental impact. However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics.

Abstract: Current benchmarks that test LLMs on static, already-solved problems (e.g., math word problems) effectively demonstrated basic capability acquisition. The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing "benchmarking" as a vehicle for scientific advancement.

Motivation: 物理信息机器学习中激活函数的选择显著影响模型性能，虽然已有研究发现ReLU在常见激活函数中表现最差，但其在仅含一阶导数的变分问题中也失效的确切原因尚不清楚，本文旨在诊断ReLU在PIML问题中表现不佳的根本原因。

Method: 通过分析ReLU的分段线性特征及其在自动微分过程中的行为，重点研究PyTorch自动微分机制在处理不连续场导数时的局限性，揭示二阶导数在训练过程中的间接影响。

Result: 发现ReLU失效的根本原因不是二阶导数在损失函数公式中的使用，而是自动微分在计算不连续场的导数时失败，导致物理信息损失的梯度计算错误，从而解释了ReLU的糟糕表现。

Conclusion: ReLU在物理信息机器学习中的失败源于自动微分技术在处理分段线性函数的二阶导数时的固有局限性，这为未来选择合适的激活函数和优化训练算法提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning uses governing ordinary and/or partial differential equations to train neural networks to represent the solution field. Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.

Conclusion: 通过将记忆化控制重新定义为选择性学习，该方法为知识产权安全和隐私保护的生成式AI建立了新的范式。

Abstract: Memorization in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models poses significant security and intellectual property risks, enabling adversarial attribute extraction and the unauthorized reproduction of sensitive or proprietary features. While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.
  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.

Abstract: Addressing selection bias in latent variable causal discovery is important yet underexplored, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical tools: While various tools beyond basic conditional independencies have been developed to handle latent variables, none have been adapted for selection bias. We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints. Using this tool, we demonstrate that the one-factor model, a classical latent variable model, can be identified under selection bias. Simulations and real-world experiments confirm the effectiveness of using our rank constraints.

Abstract: We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Lifelong deep learning (LDL) trains neural networks to learn sequentially across tasks while preserving prior knowledge. We propose Task-Aware Multi-Expert (TAME), a continual learning algorithm that leverages task similarity to guide expert selection and knowledge transfer. TAME maintains a pool of pretrained neural networks and activates the most relevant expert for each new task. A shared dense layer integrates features from the chosen expert to generate predictions. To reduce catastrophic forgetting, TAME uses a replay buffer that stores representative samples and embeddings from previous tasks and reuses them during training. An attention mechanism further prioritizes the most relevant stored information for each prediction. Together, these components allow TAME to adapt flexibly while retaining important knowledge across evolving task sequences. Experiments on binary classification tasks derived from CIFAR-100 show that TAME improves accuracy on new tasks while sustaining performance on earlier ones, highlighting its effectiveness in balancing adaptation and retention in lifelong learning settings.

Abstract: Time-series data is critical across many scientific and industrial domains, including environmental analysis, agriculture, transportation, and finance. However, mining insights from this data typically requires deep domain expertise, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Insight Miner}, a large-scale multimodal model (LMM) designed to generate high-quality, comprehensive time-series descriptions enriched with domain-specific knowledge. To facilitate this, we introduce \textbf{TS-Insights}\footnote{Available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}.}, the first general-domain dataset for time series and language alignment. TS-Insights contains 100k time-series windows sampled from 20 forecasting datasets. We construct this dataset using a novel \textbf{agentic workflow}, where we use statistical tools to extract features from raw time series before synthesizing them into coherent trend descriptions with GPT-4. Following instruction tuning on TS-Insights, Insight Miner outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal models, such as LLaVA \citep{liu2023llava} and GPT-4, in generating time-series descriptions and insights. Our findings suggest a promising direction for leveraging LMMs in time series analysis, and serve as a foundational step toward enabling LLMs to interpret time series as a native input modality.

Motivation: 现有PLC控制器逻辑攻击检测方法存在问题：基于规范的方法需要专家手动工作或访问源代码；基于机器学习的方法缺乏决策解释性。需要一种仅基于输入输出就能恢复逻辑并提供解释的方法

Method: SRLR改进了最新的深度符号回归方法，利用ICS特定属性：(1)重要控制逻辑适合频域表示；(2)支持多模式操作，模式切换不频繁；(3)过滤异常输入处理噪声传感器数据；(4)降低公式复杂度实现有效搜索

Conclusion: SRLR通过结合ICS特定属性增强符号回归，能够有效恢复PLC逻辑并生成可解释的攻击检测规则，为工业控制系统安全提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are critical components in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.

Abstract: Video generation models are rapidly advancing, but can still struggle with complex video outputs that require significant semantic branching or repeated high-level reasoning about what should happen next. In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.

Abstract: Quantum computers have the possibility of a much reduced calculation load compared with classical computers in specific problems. Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.

Abstract: Generalist multimodal agents are expected to unify perception, language, and control - operating robustly across diverse real world domains. However, current evaluation practices remain fragmented across isolated benchmarks, making it difficult to assess whether today's foundation models truly generalize beyond their training distributions. We introduce MultiNet v1.0, a unified benchmark for measuring the cross domain generality of vision language models (VLMs) and vision language action models (VLAs) across six foundational capability regimes. Visual grounding, spatial reasoning, tool use, physical commonsense, multi agent coordination, and continuous robot control. Evaluating GPT 5, Pi0, and Magma, we find that no model demonstrates consistent generality. All exhibit substantial degradation on unseen domains, unfamiliar modalities, or cross domain task shifts despite strong performance within their training distributions.These failures manifest as modality misalignment, output format instability, and catastrophic knowledge degradation under domain transfer.Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.MultiNet v1.0 provides a standardized evaluation substrate for diagnosing these gaps and guiding the development of future generalist agents.Code, data, and leaderboards are publicly available.

Abstract: While effective post-training integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), the optimal mechanism for utilizing expert trajectories remains unresolved. We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 磁芯损耗建模对电力电子系统的高效设计至关重要。针对传统建模方法预测精度有限，以及IEEE MagNet竞赛揭示的纯数据驱动模型在可解释性和跨分布泛化能力上的不足，有必要开发一种结合物理先验和数据驱动优势的混合建模方法。

Abstract: Accurate core loss modeling is critical for the design of high-efficiency power electronic systems. Traditional core loss modeling methods have limitations in prediction accuracy. To advance this field, the IEEE Power Electronics Society launched the MagNet Challenge in 2023, the first international competition focused on data-driven power electronics design methods, aiming to uncover complex loss patterns in magnetic components through a data-driven paradigm. Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid model, SEPI-TFPNet, which integrates empirical models with deep learning. The physical-prior submodule employs a spectral entropy discrimination mechanism to select the most suitable empirical model under different excitation waveforms. The data-driven submodule incorporates convolutional neural networks, multi-head attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to extract flux-density time-series features. An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration. Using the MagNet dataset containing various magnetic materials, this paper evaluates the proposed method and compares it with 21 representative models from the 2023 challenge and three advanced methods from 2024-2025. The results show that the proposed method achieves improved modeling accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: 利用对称性进行EDPs的RL调节能带来实质性好处，包括提高样本效率和策略性能。本文的理论框架和实验验证为对称性扩散策略的强化学习调节提供了系统指导。

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion policies (EDPs) combine the generative expressivity of diffusion models with the strong generalization and sample efficiency afforded by geometric symmetries. While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.

Abstract: Trust prediction provides valuable support for decision-making, risk mitigation, and system security enhancement. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.
  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CAT outperforms five groups of baselines in trust prediction, while exhibiting strong scalability to large-scale graphs and robustness against both trust-oriented and GNN-oriented attacks.

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that adversarial graphs, i.e., graphs with imperceptible perturbations, can cause deep graph models to fail on classification tasks. In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender. When the interactive game reaches a Nash equilibrium, attacker adopts more imperceptible strategies that can still achieve satisfactory attack effectiveness even after defense.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的安全对齐方法会导致模型遗忘已学习的通用能力（对齐税问题），需要大量混合任务数据且效率低下。

Method: 通过将安全策略梯度几何投影到通用任务的零空间中，在保证安全对齐的同时保护模型原有的核心能力。

Result: NSPO在数学、代码和指令遵循任务上显著优于现有方法，仅需PKU-SafeRLHF数据集40%的安全数据就能达到优异的安全性能，而无需大量混合任务数据。

Conclusion: NSPO是一种数据高效且能有效缓解对齐税的RL框架，在保证安全对齐的同时成功保留了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is important to ensure their behaviors align with human values, societal norms, and ethical principles. However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.

Abstract: We introduce sliced ReLU attention, a new attention mechanism that departs structurally from both softmax and ReLU-based alternatives. Instead of applying a nonlinearity to pairwise dot products, we operate on one-dimensional projections of key--query differences and leverage sorting to obtain quasi-linear complexity. This construction yields a differentiable, non-symmetric kernel that can be computed in O(n log(n)) through a sorting procedure, making it suitable for very long contexts. Beyond computational benefits, the model retains strong theoretical expressive power: we establish two in-context expressivity results, previously known for softmax attention, showing that sliced ReLU attention preserves the ability to perform nontrivial sequence-to-sequence disentangling tasks and satisfies a contextual universal approximation property. Finally, we illustrate the potential practical interest of this kernel in small-scale experiments.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task for uncovering patterns in data. While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs Möbius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.

Motivation: 现实时间序列预测中，异常事件对预测的影响具有差异：有些持续影响未来值（需响应），有些只是短期噪声（应忽略）。标准预测模型无法有效区分这两类异常，要么对噪声过度反应，要么错过持久性变化。

Method: Co-TSFA 通过对比学习框架生成两种数据增强：仅输入增强（模拟预测无关异常）和输入-输出增强（模拟预测相关异常），并引入潜在输出对齐损失，将表示变化与预测变化关联，从而实现对无关扰动的鲁棒性和对有意义分布变化的敏感性。

Result: 在 Traffic、Electricity 基准数据集及实际现金需求数据集上的实验表明，Co-TSFA 在异常条件下显著提高预测性能，同时在正常数据上保持准确率。

Conclusion: Co-TSFA 通过区分预测相关与无关异常，提升了时间序列预测模型对真实世界异常事件的适应能力，为解决标准模型在异常处理上的不足提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Time series forecasting predicts future values from past data. In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data. An anonymized GitHub repository with the implementation of Co-TSFA is provided and will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

These examples range from smooth closed-form benchmarks to challenging numerical integrals. Across all cases, the differential machine learning-based approach consistently outperforms standard architectures, achieving lower mean squared error, enhanced scalability, and improved sample efficiency.

Motivation: 预训练模型无需重新训练就能泛化到未见数据集是发展基础模型的关键，但在图结构数据中，特征空间的维度和语义差异大，任何变换都可能破坏归纳能力。现有方法在跨数据集归纳推理方面存在限制，需要新的表示框架和模型设计。

Conclusion: 视图空间为完全归纳的节点表示学习提供了一个原理性且有效的框架，在跨数据集泛化方面取得了显著进步。

Abstract: Generalizing a pretrained model to unseen datasets without retraining is an essential step toward a foundation model. However, achieving such cross-dataset, fully inductive inference is difficult in graph-structured data where feature spaces vary widely in both dimensionality and semantics. Any transformation in the feature space can easily violate the inductive applicability to unseen datasets, strictly limiting the design space of a graph model. In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner. We then propose Graph View Transformation (GVT), a node- and feature-permutation-equivariant mapping in the view space. GVT serves as the building block for Recurrent GVT, a fully inductive model for node representation learning. Pretrained on OGBN-Arxiv and evaluated on 27 node-classification benchmarks, Recurrent GVT outperforms GraphAny, the prior fully inductive graph model, by +8.93% and surpasses 12 individually tuned GNNs by at least +3.30%. These results establish the view space as a principled and effective ground for fully inductive node representation learning.

Conclusion: 原子动作切片方法有效提高了VLA模型在复杂任务中的泛化能力和任务成功率，相关数据集GATE-VLAP已公开。

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models generalize poorly, particularly when tasks require new compositions of skills or objects. We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

Abstract: Even for the gradient descent (GD) method applied to neural network training, understanding its optimization dynamics, including convergence rate, iterate trajectories, function value oscillations, and especially its implicit acceleration, remains a challenging problem. We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools. Using these tools, we demonstrate on a minimalistic example that the nonlinearity in a two-layer model can provably yield a faster iteration complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ compared to $Ω(d)$ achieved by linear models, where $d$ is the number of features. This helps explain the optimization dynamics and the implicit acceleration phenomenon observed in neural networks. The theoretical results are supported by extensive numerical experiments. We believe that this alternative view will further advance research on the optimization of neural networks.

Abstract: Fuzzy rule-based systems have been mostly used in interpretable decision-making because of their interpretable linguistic rules. However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

Abstract: In streaming scenarios, models must learn continuously, adapting to concept drifts without erasing previously acquired knowledge. However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SpectralKrum是一种融合谱子空间估计与几何邻居选择的联邦学习防御方法，在非IID数据下对抗攻击表现优于现有基准，但对谱不可区分的攻击（如标签翻转）效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中拜占庭客户端可能注入恶意更新破坏全局模型，现有鲁棒聚合方法在数据异构（非IID）且对手能观测防御机制时效果显著下降。

Method: 1. 估计良性优化轨迹的低维流形（谱子空间）；2. 将客户端更新投影到该子空间；3. 在压缩坐标中应用Krum选择；4. 通过数据驱动阈值过滤正交残差异常的候选更新。

Result: 在CIFAR-10（Dirichlet非IID分区，α=0.1）的7种攻击场景中测试了8个基线方法，超过56,000轮训练显示：SpectralKrum对方向和子空间感知攻击（如adaptive-steer、buffer-drift）具有竞争力，但对标签翻转和min-max攻击（恶意更新谱不可区分）效果有限。

Conclusion: SpectralKrum通过谱子空间估计有效提升联邦学习在非IID数据下的抗攻击能力，但对谱特征相似的攻击类型仍需进一步改进防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) distributes model training across clients who retain their data locally, but this architecture exposes a fundamental vulnerability: Byzantine clients can inject arbitrarily corrupted updates that degrade or subvert the global model. While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.
  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.
  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.

Abstract: Softmax attention is a central component of transformer architectures, yet its nonlinear structure poses significant challenges for theoretical analysis. We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many systems exhibit complex interactions between their components: some features or actions amplify each other's effects, others provide redundant information, and some contribute independently. We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure.

Abstract: Understanding how AI systems are used by people in real situations that mirror aspects of both legitimate and illegitimate use is key to predicting the risks and benefits of AI systems. This is especially true in biological applications, where skill rather than knowledge is often the primary barrier for an untrained person. The challenge is that these studies are difficult to execute well and can take months to plan and run.
  Here we report the results of a pilot study that attempted to empirically measure the magnitude of \emph{skills-based uplift} caused by access to an AI reasoning model, compared with a control group that had only internet access. Participants -- drawn from a diverse pool of Los Alamos National Laboratory employees with no prior wet-lab experience -- were asked to transform \ecoli{} with a provided expression construct, induce expression of a reporter peptide, and have expression confirmed by mass spectrometry.
  We recorded quantitative outcomes (e.g., successful completion of experimental segments) and qualitative observations about how participants interacted with the AI system, the internet, laboratory equipment, and one another. We present the results of the study and lessons learned in designing and executing this type of study, and we discuss these results in the context of future studies of the evolving relationship between AI and global biosecurity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Through extensive experience training professionals and individual users in AI tool adoption since the GPT-3 era, I have observed a consistent pattern: the same AI tool produces dramatically different results depending on who uses it. While some frame AI as a replacement for human intelligence, and others warn of cognitive decline, this position paper argues for a third perspective grounded in practical observation: AI as a cognitive amplifier that magnifies existing human capabilities rather than substituting for them. Drawing on research in human-computer interaction, cognitive augmentation theory, and educational technology, alongside field observations from corporate training across writing, software development, and data analysis domains, I present a framework positioning AI tools as intelligence amplification systems where output quality depends fundamentally on user expertise and judgment. Through analysis of empirical studies on expert-novice differences and systematic observations from professional training contexts, I demonstrate that domain knowledge, quality judgment, and iterative refinement capabilities create substantial performance gaps between users. I propose a three-level model of AI engagement -- from passive acceptance through iterative collaboration to cognitive direction -- and argue that the transition between levels requires not technical training but development of domain expertise and metacognitive skills. This position has critical implications for workforce development and AI system design. Rather than focusing solely on AI literacy or technical prompt engineering, I advocate for integrated approaches that strengthen domain expertise, evaluative judgment, and reflective practice.

Abstract: Affective artificial intelligence has made substantial advances in recent years; yet two critical issues persist, particularly in sensitive applications. First, these systems frequently operate as 'black boxes', leaving their decision-making processes opaque. Second, audit logs often lack reliability, as the entity operating the system may alter them. In this work, we introduce the concept of Immutable Explainability, an architecture designed to address both challenges simultaneously. Our approach combines an interpretable inference engine - implemented through fuzzy logic to produce a transparent trace of each decision - with a cryptographic anchoring mechanism that records this trace on a blockchain, ensuring that it is tamper-evident and independently verifiable. To validate the approach, we implemented a heuristic pipeline integrating lexical and prosodic analysis within an explicit Mamdani-type multimodal fusion engine. Each inference generates an auditable record that is subsequently anchored on a public blockchain (Sepolia Testnet). We evaluated the system using the Spanish MEACorpus 2023, employing both the original corpus transcriptions and those generated by Whisper. The results show that our fuzzy-fusion approach outperforms baseline methods (linear and unimodal fusion). Beyond these quantitative outcomes, our primary objective is to establish a foundation for affective AI systems that offer transparent explanations, trustworthy audit trails, and greater user control over personal data.

Abstract: Long-term life task planning is inherently complex and uncertain, yet little is known about how emerging AI systems support this process. This study investigates how people use ChatGPT for such planning tasks, focusing on user practices, uncertainties, and perceptions of AI assistance. We conducted an interview study with 14 participants who engaged in long-term planning activities using ChatGPT, combining analysis of their prompts and interview responses. The task topics across diverse domains, including personal well-being, event planning, and professional learning, along with prompts to initiate, refine, and contextualize plans. ChatGPT helped structure complex goals into manageable steps, generate ideas, and sustain motivation, serving as a reflective partner. Yet its outputs were often generic or idealized, lacking personalization, contextual realism, and adaptability, requiring users to actively adapt and verify results. Participants expressed a need for AI systems that provide adaptive and trustworthy guidance while acknowledging uncertainty and potential failure in long-term planning. Our findings show how AI supports long-term life task planning under evolving uncertainty and highlight design implications for systems that are adaptive, uncertainty-aware, and capable of supporting long-term planning as an evolving human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: While drug discovery is vital for human health, the process remains inefficient. Medicinal chemists must navigate a vast protein space to identify target proteins that meet three criteria: physical and functional interactions, therapeutic impact, and docking potential. Prior approaches have provided fragmented support for each criterion, limiting the generation of promising hypotheses for wet-lab experiments. We present HAPPIER, an AI-powered tool that supports hypothesis generation with integrated multi-criteria support for target identification. HAPPIER enables medicinal chemists to 1) efficiently explore and verify proteins in a single integrated graph component showing multi-criteria satisfaction and 2) validate AI suggestions with domain knowledge. These capabilities facilitate iterative cycles of divergent and convergent thinking, essential for hypothesis generation. We evaluated HAPPIER with ten medicinal chemists, finding that it increased the number of high-confidence hypotheses and support for the iterative cycle, and further demonstrated the relationship between engaging in such cycles and confidence in outputs.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个完整且经过验证的人工智能驱动的家庭康复监控管道，通过低成本移动健康系统解决了术后康复管理的关键挑战

Abstract: Postoperative upper limb dysfunction is prevalent among breast cancer survivors, yet their adherence to at-home rehabilitation exercises is low amidst limited nursing resources. The hardware overhead of commonly adopted VR-based mHealth solutions further hinders their widespread clinical application. Therefore, we developed Breast-Rehab, a novel, low-cost mHealth system to provide patients with out-of-hospital upper limb rehabilitation management. Breast-Rehab integrates a bespoke human action recognition algorithm with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. By fusing visual and 3D skeletal data, our model accurately segments exercise videos recorded in uncontrolled home environments, outperforming standard models. These segmented clips, combined with a domain-specific knowledge base, guide a multi-modal large language model to generate clinically relevant assessment reports. This approach significantly reduces computational overhead and mitigates model hallucinations. We implemented the system as a WeChat Mini Program and a nurse-facing dashboard. A preliminary clinical study validated the system's feasibility and user acceptance, with patients achieving an average exercise frequency of 0.59 sessions/day over a two-week period. This work thus presents a complete, validated pipeline for AI-driven, at-home rehabilitation monitoring.

Abstract: The integrity of contemporary AI systems is undermined by a critical design flaw: the misappropriation of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) models to mask systems that are fundamentally reliant on human labor. We term this structural reliance Human-Instead-of-AI (HISOAI). HISOAI systems represent an ethical failure and an unsustainable economic dependency, where human workers function as hidden operational fallbacks rather than strategic collaborators. To rectify this, we propose the AI-First, Human-Empowered (AFHE) paradigm. AFHE mandates a technological design where the AI component must achieve a minimum, quantifiable level of functional independence prior to deployment. This standard is formalized through the AI Autonomy Coefficient (alpha), a metric that determines the proportion of tasks that the AI successfully processes without mandatory human substitution. We introduce the AFHE Deployment Algorithm, an algorithmic gate that requires the system to meet a specified alpha threshold across both offline and shadow testing. By enforcing this structural separation, the AFHE framework redefines the human's role to focus exclusively on high-value tasks, including ethical oversight, boundary pushing, and strategic model tuning, thereby ensuring true system transparency and operational independence. This work advocates for a critical shift toward metric-driven, structurally sound AI architecture, moving the industry beyond deceptive human dependency toward verifiable autonomy.

Conclusion: 研究表明，机器人皮肤上的视觉反馈能有效传达人-机器人触摸交互意图，为未来安全的人机物理交互提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Effective communication of robotic touch intent is a key factor in promoting safe and predictable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). While intent communication has been widely studied, existing approaches lack the spatial specificity and semantic depth necessary to convey robot touch actions. We present Mirror Skin, a cephalopod-inspired concept that utilizes high-resolution, mirror-like visual feedback on robotic skin. By mapping in-situ visual representations of a human's body parts onto the corresponding robot's touch region, Mirror Skin communicates who shall initiate touch, where it will occur, and when it is imminent. To inform the design of Mirror Skin, we conducted a structured design exploration with experts in virtual reality (VR), iteratively refining six key dimensions. A subsequent controlled user study demonstrated that Mirror Skin significantly enhances accuracy and reduces response times for interpreting touch intent. These findings highlight the potential of visual feedback on robotic skin to communicate human-robot touch interactions.

Abstract: Text entry in Virtual Reality (VR) is challenging, even when accounting for the use of controllers. Prior work has tackled this challenge head-on, improving the efficiency of input methods. These techniques have the advantage of allowing for relatively straightforward text correction. However, text correction without the use of controllers is a topic that has not received the same amount of attention, even though it can be desirable in several scenarios, and can even be the source of frustration. Large language models have been adopted and evaluated as a corrective methodology, given their high power for predictions. Nevertheless, their predictions are not always correct, which can lead to lower usability. In this paper, we investigate whether, for text correction in VR that is hands-free, the use of AI could surpass in terms of usability and efficiency. We observed better usability for AI text correction when compared to voice input.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in academic writing practices. Although numerous studies have explored how researchers employ these tools for scientific writing, their concrete implementation, limitations, and design challenges within the literature review process remain underexplored. In this paper, we report a user study with researchers across multiple disciplines to characterize current practices, benefits, and \textit{pain points} in using LLMs to investigate related work. We identified three recurring gaps: (i) lack of trust in outputs, (ii) persistent verification burden, and (iii) requiring multiple tools. This motivates our proposal of six design goals and a high-level framework that operationalizes them through improved related papers visualization, verification at every step, and human-feedback alignment with generation-guided explanations. Overall, by grounding our work in the practical, day-to-day needs of researchers, we designed a framework that addresses these limitations and models real-world LLM-assisted writing, advancing trust through verifiable actions and fostering practical collaboration between researchers and AI systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs are often visualized using node-link diagrams that reveal relationships and structure. In many applications using graphs, it is desirable to allow users to edit graphs to ensure data accuracy or provides updates. Commonly in graph visualization, users can interact directly with the visual elements by clicking and typing updates to specific items through traditional interaction methods in the graphical user interface. However, it can become tedious to make many updates due to the need to individually select and change numerous items in a graph. Our research investigates natural language input as an alternative method for editing network graphs. We present a user study comparing GUI graph editing with two natural language alternatives to contribute novel empirical data of the trade-offs of the different interaction methods. The findings show natural language methods to be significantly more effective than traditional GUI interaction.

Abstract: While voice-based AI systems have achieved remarkable generative capabilities, their interactions often feel conversationally broken. This paper examines the interactional friction that emerges in modular Speech-to-Speech Retrieval-Augmented Generation (S2S-RAG) pipelines. By analyzing a representative production system, we move beyond simple latency metrics to identify three recurring patterns of conversational breakdown: (1) Temporal Misalignment, where system delays violate user expectations of conversational rhythm; (2) Expressive Flattening, where the loss of paralinguistic cues leads to literal, inappropriate responses; and (3) Repair Rigidity, where architectural gating prevents users from correcting errors in real-time. Through system-level analysis, we demonstrate that these friction points should not be understood as defects or failures, but as structural consequences of a modular design that prioritizes control over fluidity. We conclude that building natural spoken AI is an infrastructure design challenge, requiring a shift from optimizing isolated components to carefully choreographing the seams between them.
