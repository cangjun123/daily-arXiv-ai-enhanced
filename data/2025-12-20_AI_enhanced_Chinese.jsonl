However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation. To our knowledge, LinkedOut is the first VLLM-based video recommendation method that operates on raw frames without handcrafted labels, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Interpretability studies and ablations confirm the benefits of layer diversity and layer-wise fusion, pointing to a practical path that fully leverages VLLM world-knowledge priors and visual reasoning for downstream vision tasks such as recommendation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LinkedOut\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eVLLM\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u89e3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u5178\u578b\u63a5\u53e3\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u591a\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u8f93\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "method": "LinkedOut\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u611f\u77e5token\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u5c42\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408MoE\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u5e27\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5c42\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "LinkedOut\u4e3a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528VLLM\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u8350\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

State-of-the-art approaches decompose the task into a lifting of atomic propositions (APs) phase and a translation phase. However, existing methods struggle with accurate lifting, the existence of co-references, and learning from limited data. In this paper, we propose a framework for NL to TL translation called Grammar Forced Translation (GraFT). The framework is based on the observation that previous work solves both the lifting and translation steps by letting a language model iteratively predict tokens from its full vocabulary. In contrast, GraFT reduces the complexity of both tasks by restricting the set of valid output tokens from the full vocabulary to only a handful in each step. The solution space reduction is obtained by exploiting the unique properties of each problem. We also provide a theoretical justification for why the solution space reduction leads to more efficient learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of GraFT using the CW, GLTL, and Navi benchmarks. Compared with state-of-the-art translation approaches, it can be observed that GraFT the end-to-end translation accuracy by 5.49% and out-of-domain translation accuracy by 14.06% on average.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGrammar Forced Translation (GraFT)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u8bcd\u96c6\u5408\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u539f\u5b50\u547d\u9898\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5171\u6307\u73b0\u8c61\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u8bcd\u8868\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8fed\u4ee3\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "GraFT\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1a1\uff09\u539f\u5b50\u547d\u9898\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b2\uff09\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5148\u524d\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8bcd\u6765\u9650\u5236\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u8bcd\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f29\u51cf\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5728CW\u3001GLTL\u548cNavi\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGraFT\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.49%\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u7ffb\u8bd1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534714.06%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GraFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify how much information is expressed by prosody alone and not by text, and crucially, what that information is about. Our approach applies large speech and language models to estimate the mutual information between a particular dimension of an utterance's meaning (e.g., its emotion) and any of its communication channels (e.g., audio or text). We then use this approach to quantify how much information is conveyed by audio and text about sarcasm, emotion, and questionhood, using speech from television and podcasts. We find that for sarcasm and emotion the audio channel -- and by implication the prosodic channel -- transmits over an order of magnitude more information about these features than the text channel alone, at least when long-term context beyond the current sentence is unavailable. For questionhood, prosody provides comparatively less additional information.

We introduce Multimodal RewardBench 2 (MMRB2), the first comprehensive benchmark for reward models on multimodal understanding and (interleaved) generation. MMRB2 spans four tasks: text-to-image, image editing, interleaved generation, and multimodal reasoning (\"thinking-with-images\"), providing 1,000 expert-annotated preference pairs per task from 23 models and agents across 21 source tasks. MMRB2 is designed with: (1) practical but challenging prompts; (2) responses from state-of-the-art models and agents; and (3) preference pairs with strong human-expert consensus, curated via an ensemble filtering strategy. Using MMRB2, we study existing judges for each subtask, including multimodal LLM-as-a-judge and models trained with human preferences. The latest Gemini 3 Pro attains 75-80% accuracy. GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro reach 66-75% accuracy, compared to >90% for humans, yet surpass the widely used GPT-4o (59%). The best performing open-source model Qwen3-VL-32B achieves similar accuracies as Gemini 2.5 Flash (64%). We also show that MMRB2 performance strongly correlates with downstream task success using Best-of-N sampling and conduct an in-depth analysis that shows key areas to improve the reward models going forward.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We devise a new task in which the assignment of symbols to specific algebraic group elements varies from one sequence to another. Despite this challenging setup, transformers achieve near-perfect accuracy on the task and even generalize to unseen algebraic groups. We develop targeted data distributions to create causal tests of a set of hypothesized mechanisms, and we isolate three mechanisms models consistently learn: commutative copying where a dedicated head copies answers, identity element recognition that distinguishes identity-containing facts, and closure-based cancellation that tracks group membership to constrain valid answers. Complementary to the geometric representations found in fixed-symbol settings, our findings show that models develop symbolic reasoning mechanisms when trained to reason in-context with variables whose meanings are not fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Additionally, it has been shown that model performance improvement through fine-tuning often results from the strengthening of existing circuits in the model. Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of intervening directly on such circuits to make precise, task-targeted updates. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method called Constructive Circuit Amplification which identifies pivotal tokens from model reasoning traces as well as model components responsible for the desired task, and updates only those components. Applied to mathematical reasoning, it improves accuracy by up to +11.4% across multiple models while modifying as little as 1.59% of model components, with minimal impact on other abilities as measured by MMLU, TriviaQA, and TruthfulQA. These results demonstrate that targeted capabilities can be reliably enhanced by selectively updating a sparse set of model components.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce Generative Adversarial Reasoner, an on-policy joint training framework designed to enhance reasoning by co-evolving an LLM reasoner and an LLM-based discriminator through adversarial reinforcement learning. A compute-efficient review schedule partitions each reasoning chain into logically complete slices of comparable length, and the discriminator evaluates each slice's soundness with concise, structured justifications. Learning couples complementary signals: the LLM reasoner is rewarded for logically consistent steps that yield correct answers, while the discriminator earns rewards for correctly detecting errors or distinguishing traces in the reasoning process. This produces dense, well-calibrated, on-policy step-level rewards that supplement sparse exact-match signals, improving credit assignment, increasing sample efficiency, and enhancing overall reasoning quality of LLMs. Across various mathematical benchmarks, the method delivers consistent gains over strong baselines with standard RL post-training. Specifically, on AIME24, we improve DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B from 54.0 to 61.3 (+7.3) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B from 43.7 to 53.7 (+10.0).

Existing compression techniques, such as quantization and pruning, often degrade critical linguistic properties and lack formal guarantees for preserving model behavior. We propose Temporal Logic-Guided Large Language Model Compression (TOGGLE), a novel framework that leverages Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to formally specify and enforce linguistic properties during compression. TOGGLE employs an STL robustness-guided Bayesian optimization to systematically explore layer-wise quantization and pruning configurations, generating compressed models that formally satisfy specified linguistic constraints without retraining or fine-tuning. Evaluating TOGGLE on four LLM architectures (GPT-2, DeepSeek-V2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B, and Mistral 7B), we achieve up to 3.3x reduction in computational costs (FLOPs) and up to a 68.8% reduction in model size while satisfying all linguistic properties. TOGGLE represents the first integration of formal methods into LLM compression, enabling efficient, verifiable deployment of LLMs on edge hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "TOGGLE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u7684LLM\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5f80\u5f80\u635f\u5bb3\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\uff08STL\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u89c4\u8303\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7STL\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u526a\u679d\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aLLM\u67b6\u6784\uff08GPT-2\u3001DeepSeek-V2 7B\u3001LLaMA 3 8B\u3001Mistral 7B\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe3.3\u500d\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff08FLOPs\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u548c68.8%\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "conclusion": "TOGGLE\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u5230LLM\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing responsible AI and governance efforts provide important normative principles but often lack enforceable engineering mechanisms that operate throughout the system lifecycle. This paper introduces the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS), a six-layer architectural framework that embeds societal values into AI systems as explicit constraints, safeguards, behavioural interfaces, auditing mechanisms, and governance processes. SRS models responsibility as a closed-loop supervisory control problem over socio-technical systems, integrating design-time safeguards with runtime monitoring and institutional oversight. We develop a unified constraint-based formulation, introduce safety-envelope and feedback interpretations, and show how fairness, autonomy, cognitive burden, and explanation quality can be continuously monitored and enforced. Case studies in clinical decision support, cooperative autonomous vehicles, and public-sector systems illustrate how SRS translates normative objectives into actionable engineering and operational controls. The framework bridges ethics, control theory, and AI governance, providing a practical foundation for accountable, adaptive, and auditable socio-technical AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\"\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efb\u5806\u6808\uff08SRS\uff09\"\u7684\u516d\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u793e\u4f1a\u4ef7\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u884c\u4e3a\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5d4c\u5165AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u673a\u6784\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efbAI\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5185\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86SRS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8d23\u4efb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u76d1\u7763\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u673a\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5305\u7edc\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u6267\u884c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u516c\u5171\u90e8\u95e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86SRS\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "SRS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u548cAI\u6cbb\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u67b6\u8d77\u4e86\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d1f\u8d23\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Historically, many methodologies have tackled this challenge, but consistent real-time accuracy, especially in diverse environments, remains elusive. This study examines the performance of YOLOv8 variants on License Plate Recognition (LPR) and Character Recognition tasks, crucial for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems. Two distinct datasets were employed for training and evaluation, yielding notable findings. The YOLOv8 Nano variant demonstrated a precision of 0.964 and mAP50 of 0.918 on the LPR task, while the YOLOv8 Small variant exhibited a precision of 0.92 and mAP50 of 0.91 on the Character Recognition task. A custom method for character sequencing was introduced, effectively sequencing the detected characters based on their x-axis positions.

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316). Structural coherence also improved, with RadGraph F1 rising by 9.7%. Despite its small size and purely image-conditioned design, the model demonstrates that decoder-level anatomical guidance improves spatial grounding and enhances coherence in clinically relevant regions.

Using OpenTouch, we introduce retrieval and classification benchmarks that probe how touch grounds perception and action. We show that tactile signals provide a compact yet powerful cue for grasp understanding, strengthen cross-modal alignment, and can be reliably retrieved from in-the-wild video queries.

Attempts to expand sampling across hospitals, institutions, or countries with differing regulations face severe privacy, regulatory, and logistical obstacles that are often difficult to overcome. The Federated Learning (FL) provides a promising solution by enabling collaborative model training across decentralized datasets while keeping patient data local and private. Here, we report a novel global FL initiative using the Sherpa.ai FL platform, which leverages FL across distributed datasets in two international organizations for the diagnosis of COL6-RD, using collagen VI immunofluorescence microscopy images from patient-derived fibroblast cultures. Our solution resulted in an ML model capable of classifying collagen VI patient images into the three primary pathogenic mechanism groups associated with COL6-RD: exon skipping, glycine substitution, and pseudoexon insertion. This new approach achieved an F1-score of 0.82, outperforming single-organization models (0.57-0.75). These results demonstrate that FL substantially improves diagnostic utility and generalizability compared to isolated institutional models.

We argue that satisfying these constraints can lead to benchmark drift over time, where the static benchmark judges fail to keep up with newer model capabilities. We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore). Although we hope GenEval 2 will provide a strong benchmark for many years, avoiding benchmark drift is far from guaranteed and our work, more generally, highlights the importance of continual audits and improvement for T2I and related automated model evaluation benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce RePlan (Region-aligned Planning), a plan-then-execute framework that couples a vision-language planner with a diffusion editor. The planner decomposes instructions via step-by-step reasoning and explicitly grounds them to target regions; the editor then applies changes using a training-free attention-region injection mechanism, enabling precise, parallel multi-region edits without iterative inpainting. To strengthen planning, we apply GRPO-based reinforcement learning using 1K instruction-only examples, yielding substantial gains in reasoning fidelity and format reliability. We further present IV-Edit, a benchmark focused on fine-grained grounding and knowledge-intensive edits.

Lensch"], "title": "Memory-Enhanced SAM3 for Occlusion-Robust Surgical Instrument Segmentation", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Accurate surgical instrument segmentation in endoscopic videos is crucial for computer-assisted interventions, yet remains challenging due to frequent occlusions, rapid motion, specular artefacts, and long-term instrument re-entry. While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation.

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u6750\u8d28\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u7269\u4f53\u6750\u6599\u6210\u5206\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u82b1\u6735\u4e3a\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u7269\u4f53\u662f\u5355\u6750\u8d28\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u9884\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6750\u8d28\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u76843D\u548c2D\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u5272\u6750\u6599\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u5176\u8fde\u7eed\u4ecb\u8d28\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u91cd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Phlowers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86M-PhyGs\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "M-PhyGs\u4e3a\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u6750\u8d28\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6750\u6599\u53c2\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of FlashPortrait both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashPortrait\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65e0\u9650\u957f\u5ea6\u4eba\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u4eba\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u8eab\u4efd\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u503c\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u9762\u90e8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u6df7\u5408\u786e\u4fdd\u957f\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4. \u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5c42\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u5e45\u5ea6\u6bd4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5bfc\u6570\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlashPortrait\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u957f\u4eba\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "FlashPortrait\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u4eba\u50cf\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training. Experiments on both synthetic and web-crawled datasets demonstrate that Alchemist consistently improves visual quality and downstream performance. Training on an Alchemist-selected 50% of the data can outperform training on the full dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards. Furthermore, we propose a data construction pipeline designed to synthetically generate diverse, high-fidelity paired video-instruction data of basic editing operations.

To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements.

Experiments across twelve benchmarks demonstrate the strong reasoning capability of AdaTooler-V, outperforming existing methods in diverse visual reasoning tasks.

To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate challenging questions and counterfactual images that maximize disagreement among target models. Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types. Fine-tuning on these discoveries consistently improves all models across 16 benchmarks, and enables a 3B model to surpass its 28B counterpart. Our results suggest that as data scaling hits diminishing returns, targeted model auditing offers an effective path to model diagnosis and improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike text-only approaches and existing trajectory-controlled image-to-video methods, our multimodal approach combines trajectories -- encoding motion, timing, and visibility -- with natural language for semantic intent and reference images for visual grounding of object identity, enabling the generation of coherent, controllable events that include multi-agent interactions, object entry/exit, reference-guided appearance and counterintuitive events. The resulting videos demonstrate not only temporal coherence but also emergent consistency, preserving object identity and scene despite temporary disappearance. By supporting expressive world events generation, WorldCanvas advances world models from passive predictors to interactive, user-shaped simulators.
