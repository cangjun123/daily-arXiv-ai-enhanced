We present ALAS,\na stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from\nnon-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks\nand restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in\nprogress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh,\nbounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The\nrepair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies\n(retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards)\ndefined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo\nWorkflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical\nbenchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent\nbaselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running\n1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows\nthat the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and\nthat localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius\nand less makespan degradation than global recompute.

However, these contests do not reflect\nthe depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced\nmathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each\nwith 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a\ndifficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD\nqualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both\nPhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our\nevaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a\nstark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%\n(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals\nthat models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their\nability to formalize this reasoning.

We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples.

In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property.

GPT-4o was prompted with clinical\ninstructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study\nusing 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four\nresidents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error\ntypes were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement\nbetween GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader\nreliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was\nmeasured as the proportion of cases rated helpful.\n  Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition\nof key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and\n(3) final assessment inconsistent with findings.

A critical distinction in this\ncontext is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or\nfalse answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic\nknowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what\nis the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal\nis to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of\nknowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that\nLLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they\ninternalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful\nuniversal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time,\nclassical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight\nfundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions,\nchallenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we\ndevelop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating\nwhether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world\npopulations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social\nbehavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not\nseem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the\ncontext of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that\nlanguage models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer\n1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional\n(Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also\nlimited.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8eLLMs\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5185\u5316\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5185\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u5b9e\u9645\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5176\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Although machine learning models\nhave advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks\nthat compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.\nConventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require\nextensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits\nadaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework\nthat uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and\nsanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot\nlearning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \\textit{role play} prompting,\nwhereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor\nanomalies, and \\textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer\npoisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.\nThese strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable\nrobust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive\nevaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization\nquality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality\nand effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable\nIoT systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6e05\u6d17\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u5728\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff08HAR\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6e05\u6d17\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u96f6-shot\u3001one-shot\u548cfew-shot\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6d01\u6570\u636e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u6e05\u6d17\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

For instance, repeated\nuse may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may\nrestore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or\nGaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world\nsettings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can\ncompute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not\nprovide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting\nthe ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of\nparticular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in\ndeveloping just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level\neffects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In\nthis paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored\nto the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.\nWe then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization\nand population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret\nand minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning\nphysical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our\nmethods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high\nstatistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly\nincreasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while\naccounting for individual behavioral dynamics.

In such\nsetting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language,\nformalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it\nwill get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the\noriginal informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results\nreveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA\nmodels in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA\naccuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving\nliterature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion\nof this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for\nmore than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the\nerrors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements,\nand present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements\nand proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to\nthe best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the\noriginal miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the\nautoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a\nhigher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the\nfield of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success\nmodes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily\nmanifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and\nother unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order\nmethods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient\ninformation, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are\nill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the\nrapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial\nimprovements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities.\nConsequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language\nmodels has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we\nchoose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel\napproach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large\nlanguage model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical\nPart(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further\nutilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the\nmulti-modal characteristics of large language models.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view\nsynthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely\ncaptured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting\ntheir practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three\nsparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,\nrendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity\nof input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of\ncamera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D\nreconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a\nprior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,\nfollowed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training\nefficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS.

Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and\nultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive\nhuman annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce\ndefects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable\nperformance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free\nframework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect\ndetection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information\nGuided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a\nlearnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to\ncoarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,\nwe introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages\nfocused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information\nGuided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided\nattention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student\nmodel.

Bowden", "Sergey Levine", "Jennifer Listgarten"], "title": "Leveraging Discrete Function Decomposability for Scientific Design", "comment": null, "summary": "In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design\ndiscrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient.

Accepted - In Press, IAAI'26", "summary": "This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage\nassessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed\noperationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and\nHelene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect\nimagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,\nteams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,\nrepresenting more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by\nsubject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.\nTo alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and\nmachine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed\nto automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state\nof practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has\nbeen confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice\nvia the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment\nwith sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known\ndataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage\nlabels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best\nperforming model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and\nHelene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.\nThis work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage\nassessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML\nresearch and user communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684AI/ML\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u707e\u540e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u5bb3\u73b0\u573a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u9020\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8esUAS\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5305\u542b21716\u4e2a\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u574f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c91\u540d\u707e\u5bb3\u4ece\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "result": "\u5728Hurricanes Debby\u548cHelene\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u7ea618\u5206\u949f\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30415\u680b\u5efa\u7b51\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI/ML\u5728\u707e\u540e\u5efa\u7b51\u635f\u574f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u6559\u8bad\u3002"}}

A key challenge affecting user experience is how\nto enable users to efficiently and intuitively select the devices they wish to\ncontrol. This paper proposes PnPSelect, a plug-and-play IoT device selection\nsolution utilizing Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology on commercial devices.\nUnlike previous works, PnPSelect does not require the installation of dedicated\nhardware on each IoT device, thereby reducing deployment costs and\ncomplexities, and achieving true plug-and-play functionality. To enable\nintuitive device selection, we introduce a pointing direction estimation method\nthat utilizes UWB readings from a single anchor to infer the user pointing\ndirection.

While recent works have leveraged monocular\ndepth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and\ndepth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to\nsurgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation\nframework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation\nencoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB\nfeatures and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.\nTo efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient\nprojection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a\nSubsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient\nfine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing\nrepresentational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB\nand depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new\nLaparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.\nOn the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface\nDistance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,\nwe evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive\nperformance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating\nstrong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical\nenvironments.

Through in-depth review of Chinese and Western art\ntheories and pioneering integration of the Chinese cultural perspective, this\ngraph took shape. The core visual language of art images was deconstructed by\nthis knowledge graph. Meanwhile, the unique spatial theory and symbolic system\nof Chinese painting were compared with and supplemented by Western art\ntheories.

Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason\non isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little\nsupport for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA\ndatasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We\nintroduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward\nlooking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and\n734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert\nannotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming\ninstrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video\nlanguage model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal\nCross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,\nwhile an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the\ntoken level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone\nto the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and\nEndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations\nshow that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame\nbudget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32\nframes slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a\ntemporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA\nadvances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.\nPitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and\nhighlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future\naware surgical assistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "PitVQA-Anticipation\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5916\u79d1\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0cSurgAnt-ViVQA\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u5916\u79d1\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u53ef\u89c6\u6027\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5185\u955c\u4e0b\u7ecf\u8776\u7aa6\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5373\u5c06\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f85\u52a9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SurgAnt-ViVQA\uff0c\u5229\u7528GRU\u95e8\u63a7\u65f6\u5e8f\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u5e94\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411GRU\u7f16\u7801\u5e27\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5916\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728PitVQA-Anticipation\u548cEndoVis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cSurgAnt-ViVQA\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "PitVQA-Anticipation\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5916\u79d1\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7SurgAnt-ViVQA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5916\u79d1\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4ece\u56de\u987e\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u672a\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u5916\u79d1\u8f85\u52a9\u3002"}}

Under corruption, the median step filters out\noutliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.\nUpdating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence\nin experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence\nof corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing\nonly by an additive term tied to the total corruption.

Yet, the\nstatistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,\ncausing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare\nsignals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,\ncreating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine\nthis gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods\noperating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;\nlocality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote\nefficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of\nself-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation\nspace around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these\nprinciples, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained\nwithin a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the\nlikelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,\nanomaly-free reference.

However, while various\nprompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus\nprimarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This\nleaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more\ngeneral and complex multi-image reasoning tasks.

Our findings\nreveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues\nand seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,\nwe propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions\n(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems\nwith an arbitrary number of images.

Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield\nsoft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,\nwhen trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask\nconditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly\nbridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging\ndiversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned\nwith real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the\nmixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually\nre-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.\nAcross Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC\n2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and\nconsistent gains over baselines.

RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics\nsubfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling),\nwhich demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern\nrecognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model\narchitectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to\ntargeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant\nbenefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data\nintegration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis.\nRQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and\nsynthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests\nthe main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that\nimpact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust\nevaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular\ndatasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as\nCELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly\nsupport the training and generalization of GenAI models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u53d8\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6539\u5584\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\uff08RQ\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u548c\u5143\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u524d\u666f\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when\ncooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a\nstraightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key\nchallenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level\nfundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level\ndiscriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we\npropose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively\ndecouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative\nability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a\nlightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional\ndecomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order\nstatistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance\ntheir discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor\narchitecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss\nweights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial\ntraining phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of\ndiscriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of\nearly stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability\ntowards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively\ndecouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms\nof architecture design and model optimization.

However, conventional\napproaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require\nmodel retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or\nresource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on\nbatch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but\nthey often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained\nto specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration\n(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation\ndistributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the\nfull shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures\nemploying BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of\nestimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a\nrobust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our\nmethod leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling\nunsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,\nCIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR\nachieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing\ntest-time adaptation baselines.

In contrast,\npretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated\nstrong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their\npotential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally\ndifferent from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly\n(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities\nthrough two key innovations.

It\nis essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various\ninformation from multiple modalities.

Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such\nas CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that\nfocus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose\nAdding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces\nadversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations\nintroduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations.

In this work, we propose an automated method for\nstandardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the\nembryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.\nThe candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three\nstrategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image\nmatching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest\nclassifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D\nultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional\nCohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,\nPCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo.

We evaluate the approach on two\ndistinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological\ntransition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the\ncoordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.\nIn both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher\ngeneralisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel\napproaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional biomedical signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u6362\u7eaf\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7531\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7f29\u653e\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff08\u9884\u6d4bECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6838\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5750\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance.

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target.

Unlike\ntraditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora\nand often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach\neliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of\nmulti-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named\nDMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different\ntransport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to\nobtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using\na novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and\nmaximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%\nand an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers\nand recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that\nSentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over\nalternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%\ngain compared to standard contrastive objectives.

These requirements\nseverely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide\nonly state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is\noften suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation\nreinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining\ndeep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from\nobservation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation\nQ-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs\nexpert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence\nmechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.\nThis enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training\nwhile maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further\nextend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to\ntackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a\nchallenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.\nHA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging\nprocedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to\nexpert guidance when direct action replication is impossible.

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines\nconsistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to\nlower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6536\u7f29\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u8de8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5747\u503c\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}
