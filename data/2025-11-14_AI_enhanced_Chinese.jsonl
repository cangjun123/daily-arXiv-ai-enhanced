Yet, humans systematically overrely on AI advice, even when their independent judgment would yield superior outcomes, fundamentally undermining the potential of human-AI complementarity. Building on prior work, we identify prevailing incentive structures in human-AI decision-making as a structural driver of this overreliance. To address this misalignment, we propose an alternative incentive mechanism designed to counteract systemic overreliance. We empirically evaluate this approach through a behavioral experiment with 180 participants, finding that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces overreliance. We also show that while appropriately designed incentives can enhance collaboration and decision quality, poorly designed incentives may distort behavior, introduce unintended consequences, and ultimately degrade performance. These findings underscore the importance of aligning incentives with task context and human-AI complementarities, and suggest that effective collaboration requires a shift toward context-sensitive incentive design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To understand this, we conducted a pre-registered online experiment (N = 304) investigating how the detail and confidence of AI-generated responses influence belief change. We introduce an analysis framework with two targeted measures: belief switch and belief shift. These distinguish between users changing their initial stance after AI input and the extent to which they adjust their conviction toward or away from the AI's stance, thereby quantifying not only categorical changes but also more subtle, continuous adjustments in belief strength that indicate a reinforcement or weakening of existing beliefs. Using this framework, we find that detailed responses with medium confidence are associated with the largest overall belief changes. Highly confident messages tend to elicit belief shifts but induce fewer stance reversals. Our results also show that task type (fact-checking versus opinion evaluation), prior conviction, and perceived stance agreement further modulate the extent and direction of belief change. These findings illustrate how different properties of AI responses interact with user beliefs in subtle but potentially consequential ways and raise practical as well as ethical considerations for the design of LLM-powered systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security.

However, the task is challenging due to its large label space (10,000 to 20,000 codes) and long-tail distribution, where a few codes dominate while many rare codes lack sufficient training data. To address this, we propose a learning method that models fine-grained co-occurrence relationships among codes. Specifically, we construct a Directed Bipartite Graph Encoder with disjoint sets of common and rare code nodes. To facilitate a one-way information flow, edges are directed exclusively from common to rare codes. The nature of these connections is defined by a probability-based bias, which is derived from the conditional probability of a common code co-occurring given the presence of a rare code. This bias is then injected into the encoder's attention module, a process we term Co-occurrence Encoding. This structure empowers the graph encoder to enrich rare code representations by aggregating latent comorbidity information reflected in the statistical co-occurrence of their common counterparts. To ensure high-quality input to the graph, we utilize a large language model (LLM) to generate comprehensive descriptions for codes, enriching initial embeddings with clinical context and comorbidity information, serving as external knowledge for the statistical co-occurrence relationships in the code system. Experiments on three automated ICD coding benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with particularly notable improvements in Macro-F1, which is the key metric for long-tail classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency.

To jointly mitigate the challenges posed by missing and noisy modalities, we propose a framework called Two-stage Modality Denoising and Complementation (TMDC). TMDC comprises two sequential training stages. In the Intra-Modality Denoising Stage, denoised modality-specific and modality-shared representations are extracted from complete data using dedicated denoising modules, reducing the impact of noise and enhancing representational robustness. In the Inter-Modality Complementation Stage, these representations are leveraged to compensate for missing modalities, thereby enriching the available information and further improving robustness.

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages.

However, the reliability implications of this shift remain largely unexplored. i.e., whether substituting traditional agents with LLM-based agents can effectively enhance the reliability of MAS. In this work, we investigate and quantify the reliability of LLM-based agents from the perspective of Byzantine fault tolerance. We observe that LLM-based agents demonstrate stronger skepticism when processing erroneous message flows, a characteristic that enables them to outperform traditional agents across different topological structures. Motivated by the results of the pilot experiment, we design CP-WBFT, a confidence probe-based weighted Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to enhance the stability of MAS with different topologies.

The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes.

Nonetheless, equivariant methods are often not employed, perhaps because training is perceived to be challenging, or the symmetry is expected to be learned, or equivariant implementations are seen as hard to build. Group averaging is an available technique for these situations. It happens at test time; it can make any trained model precisely equivariant at a (often small) cost proportional to the size of the group; it places no requirements on model structure or training. It is known that, under mild conditions, the group-averaged model will have a provably better prediction accuracy than the original model. Here we show that an inexpensive group averaging can improve accuracy in practice. We take well-established benchmark machine learning models of differential equations in which certain symmetries ought to be obeyed. At evaluation time, we average the models over a small group of symmetries. Our experiments show that this procedure always decreases the average evaluation loss, with improvements of up to 37\\% in terms of the VRMSE. The averaging produces visually better predictions for continuous dynamics.

This presupposes moral preferences as static targets, but such preferences often evolve over time. Proper alignment of AI to dynamic human preferences should ideally account for \"legitimate\" changes to moral reasoning, while ignoring changes related to attention deficits, cognitive biases, or other arbitrary factors. However, common AI alignment approaches largely neglect temporal changes in preferences, posing serious challenges to proper alignment, especially in high-stakes applications of AI, e.g., in healthcare domains, where misalignment can jeopardize the trustworthiness of the system and yield serious individual and societal harms. This work investigates the extent to which people's moral preferences change over time, and the impact of such changes on AI alignment. Our study is grounded in the kidney allocation domain, where we elicit responses to pairwise comparisons of hypothetical kidney transplant patients from over 400 participants across 3-5 sessions. We find that, on average, participants change their response to the same scenario presented at different times around 6-20% of the time (exhibiting \"response instability\"). Additionally, we observe significant shifts in several participants' retrofitted decision-making models over time (capturing \"model instability\"). The predictive performance of simple AI models decreases as a function of both response and model instability. Moreover, predictive performance diminishes over time, highlighting the importance of accounting for temporal changes in preferences during training.

This inference-time guidance directs the generative process toward heat sink designs that not only prevent overheating but also achieve lower pressure drops compared to traditional optimization methods such as CMA-ES. In contrast to traditional black-box optimization approaches, our method is scalable, provided sufficient training data is available. Unlike traditional topology optimization methods, once the model is trained and the heat sink world model is saved, inference under new constraints (e.g., temperature) is computationally inexpensive and does not require retraining. Samples generated using the guided diffusion model achieve pressure drops up to 10 percent lower than the limits obtained by traditional black-box optimization methods.

Researchers address these by lab testing, rate limiting, setting up clear communication channels, and relying heavily on mentors and colleagues for guidance. Researchers express that ethical requirements vary across institutions, jurisdictions and conferences, and ethics review boards often lack the technical knowledge to evaluate Internet measurement research.

This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months.

EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort.

From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline.

This standard implementation harbors significant computational redundancy, as all heads independently compute attention over the same sequence space. Existing sparse methods, meanwhile, often trade information integrity for computational efficiency. To resolve this efficiency-performance trade-off, we propose SPAttention, whose core contribution is the introduction of a new paradigm we term Principled Structural Sparsity. SPAttention does not merely drop connections but instead reorganizes the computational task by partitioning the total attention workload into balanced, non-overlapping distance bands, assigning each head a unique segment. This approach transforms the multi-head attention mechanism from $H$ independent $O(N^2)$ computations into a single, collaborative $O(N^2)$ computation, fundamentally reducing complexity by a factor of $H$. The structured inductive bias compels functional specialization among heads, enabling a more efficient allocation of computational resources from redundant modeling to distinct dependencies across the entire sequence span. Extensive empirical validation on the OLMoE-1B-7B and 0.25B-1.75B model series demonstrates that while delivering an approximately two-fold increase in training throughput, its performance is on par with standard dense attention, even surpassing it on select key metrics, while consistently outperforming representative sparse attention methods including Longformer, Reformer, and BigBird across all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This gives rise to parametric expensive multi-objective optimization problems (P-EMOPs) where each task parameter defines a distinct optimization instance. Current multi-objective Bayesian optimization methods have been widely used for finding finite sets of Pareto optimal solutions for individual tasks. However, P-EMOPs present a fundamental challenge: the continuous task parameter space can contain infinite distinct problems, each requiring separate expensive evaluations. This demands learning an inverse model that can directly predict optimized solutions for any task-preference query without expensive re-evaluation. This paper introduces the first parametric multi-objective Bayesian optimizer that learns this inverse model by alternating between (1) acquisition-driven search leveraging inter-task synergies and (2) generative solution sampling via conditional generative models. This approach enables efficient optimization across related tasks and finally achieves direct solution prediction for unseen parameterized EMOPs without additional expensive evaluations. We theoretically justify the faster convergence by leveraging inter-task synergies through task-aware Gaussian processes.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands.

It provides a platform for students to post their questions related to the content and admin issues related to the course. However, there are several challenges due to the increase in the number of students enrolled in the course. The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u4e00\u822c FMs \u5728\u80f8\u90e8 X \u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\uff08\u533b\u5b66 vs. \u4e00\u822c\uff09\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u516b\u79cd\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66FMs\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we develop UCB-QRL, an optimistic learning algorithm for the $\u03c4$-quantile objective in finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs).

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259.

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues.

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u64cd\u63a7\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8679\u819c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5404\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u64cd\u63a7\u7279\u5b9a\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u9700\u6c42\u8c03\u6574\u7279\u5f81\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity.

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u6765\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u4e8ePTM\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684EFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8ePTM\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfEFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces.

Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model.

In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations.

Originally proposed as a generalization of the binary spatter code model, it aims to provide higher representational power while remaining a lighter alternative to models requiring high-precision components. Despite this potential, MCR has received limited attention. Systematic analyses of its trade-offs and comparisons with other models are lacking, sustaining the perception that its added complexity outweighs the improved expressivity. In this work, we revisit MCR by presenting its first extensive evaluation, demonstrating that it achieves a unique balance of capacity, accuracy, and hardware efficiency. Experiments measuring capacity demonstrate that MCR outperforms binary and integer vectors while approaching complex-valued representations at a fraction of their memory footprint. Evaluation on 123 datasets confirms consistent accuracy gains and shows that MCR can match the performance of binary spatter codes using up to 4x less memory. We investigate the hardware realization of MCR by showing that it maps naturally to digital logic and by designing the first dedicated accelerator. Evaluations on basic operations and 7 selected datasets demonstrate a speedup of up to 3 orders of magnitude and significant energy reductions compared to software implementation. When matched for accuracy against binary spatter codes, MCR achieves on average 3.08x faster execution and 2.68x lower energy consumption.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75283DGS\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e3D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u51653D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\uff083DGS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e09\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u7f16\u8f91\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u914d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9002\u5e943D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e3a\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues.

These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification.

While deep learning has substantially advanced this field, two challenges remain fundamental: the uncertainty of atmospheric dynamics and the efficient modeling of high-dimensional data. Diffusion models have shown strong promise by producing sharp, reliable forecasts, but their iterative sampling process is computationally prohibitive for time-critical applications. We introduce FlowCast, the first model to apply Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) to precipitation nowcasting. Unlike diffusion, CFM learns a direct noise-to-data mapping, enabling rapid, high-fidelity sample generation with drastically fewer function evaluations. Our experiments demonstrate that FlowCast establishes a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy. A direct comparison further reveals the CFM objective is both more accurate and significantly more efficient than a diffusion objective on the same architecture, maintaining high performance with significantly fewer sampling steps.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. Ablation studies and qualitative analyses further confirm that trend-aware uncertainty modeling yields more effective retrieval timing. The method is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and readily integrable into existing decoding pipelines.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \\textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \\textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection.

We tackle the critical task of generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, without access to explicit context information at test time. Recent work has addressed this problem by training a context encoder and a history adaptation module in separate stages. While promising, this two-phase approach is cumbersome to implement and train.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data.

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.

Although pipeline parallelism alleviates memory pressure by partitioning models across devices, it incurs activation communication overhead that scales linearly with sequence length, limiting efficiency in long-context training. Recent weight-passing approaches (e.g., WeiPipe) mitigate this by transmitting model weights instead of activations, but suffer from redundant peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers and underutilized intra-node bandwidth. We propose TawPipe--topology-aware weight pipeline parallelism, which exploits hierarchical bandwidth in distributed clusters for improved communication efficiency. TawPipe: (i) groups devices based on topology to optimize intra-node collective and inter-node P2P communication; (ii) assigns each device a fixed shard of model weights and gradients, avoiding redundant transfers; and (iii) overlaps communication with computation to hide latency. Unlike global collective operations used in fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP), TawPipe confines most communication within node boundaries, significantly reducing cross-node traffic.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on three RGB-D VSOD datasets, and the results show that the proposed SAM-DAQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of all evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5SAM-DAQ\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\uff08SAM-DAQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aRGB-D VSOD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAM-DAQ\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SAM-DAQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RGB-D\u89c6\u9891\u663e\u8457\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional multimodal approaches that simply fuse numerical indicators and textual sentiment rarely adapt to such shifts. We introduce macro-contextual retrieval, a retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that grounds each prediction in historically analogous macroeconomic regimes. The method jointly embeds macro indicators (e.g., CPI, unemployment, yield spread, GDP growth) and financial news sentiment in a shared similarity space, enabling causal retrieval of precedent periods during inference without retraining.\n  Trained on seventeen years of S&P 500 data (2007-2023) and evaluated OOD on AAPL (2024) and XOM (2024), the framework consistently narrows the CV to OOD performance gap. Macro-conditioned retrieval achieves the only positive out-of-sample trading outcomes (AAPL: PF=1.18, Sharpe=0.95; XOM: PF=1.16, Sharpe=0.61), while static numeric, text-only, and naive multimodal baselines collapse under regime shifts. Beyond metric gains, retrieved neighbors form interpretable evidence chains that correspond to recognizable macro contexts, such as inflationary or yield-curve inversion phases, supporting causal interpretability and transparency.

Our main results highlight a dramatic difference between these two settings: For distribution-independent learning, we prove a strong equivalence between the two noise models: If a class ${\\cal C}$ of functions is efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise, then it is also efficiently learnable in the presence of $\u03b7$-rate nasty noise. In sharp contrast, for the fixed-distribution setting we show an arbitrarily large separation: Under a standard cryptographic assumption, for any arbitrarily large value $r$ there exists a concept class for which there is a ratio of $r$ between the rate $\u03b7_{malicious}$ of malicious noise that polynomial-time learning algorithms can tolerate, versus the rate $\u03b7_{nasty}$ of nasty noise that such learning algorithms can tolerate.\n  To offset the negative result for the fixed-distribution setting, we define a broad and natural class of algorithms, namely those that ignore contradictory examples (ICE). We show that for these algorithms, malicious noise and nasty noise are equivalent up to a factor of two in the noise rate: Any efficient ICE learner that succeeds with $\u03b7$-rate malicious noise can be converted to an efficient learner that succeeds with $\u03b7/2$-rate nasty noise.

Current frameworks such as ReAct are prone to local optimization traps due to their reliance on incremental decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Planner-centric Plan-Execute paradigm that fundamentally resolves local optimization bottlenecks through architectural innovation. Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCC-3D\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f293D\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d3D-VLM\u5728\u5904\u74063D\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29(HCC-3D)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29(GSC)\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398(ADM)\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "HCC-3D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4(\u7ea698%)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "HCC-3D\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u538b\u7f293D\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfcToken\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "HPR\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u4e86\u4e94\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684token\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that malicious parties can poison such systems by injecting arbitrary malicious tokens in benign models in both out-of-context and in-context attacks. Using empirical examples of math and coding tasks, we show that adversarial attacks can easily poison the benign nodes, polluting their local LLM post-training, achieving attack success rates up to 100% in as few as 50 iterations. We propose two ways to defend against these attacks, depending on whether all users train the same model or different models. We show that these defenses can achieve stop rates of up to 100%, making the attack impossible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGRPO\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fGRPO\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u5982\u4f55\u6bd2\u5316\u826f\u6027\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u6076\u610f\u65b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6076\u610f\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6bd2\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe100%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u653b\u51fb\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe100%\u3002"}}

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned.

However, existing approaches to enhancing multi-turn instruction following primarily rely on collecting or generating large-scale multi-turn dialogue datasets to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), which treat each response generation as an isolated task and fail to explicitly incorporate multi-turn instruction following into the optimization objectives. As a result, instruction-tuned LLMs often struggle with complex long-distance constraints. In multi-turn dialogues, relational constraints across turns can be naturally modeled as labeled directed edges, making graph structures particularly suitable for modeling multi-turn instruction following. Despite this potential, leveraging graph structures to enhance the multi-turn instruction following capabilities of LLMs remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose GraphIF, a plug-and-play framework that models multi-turn dialogues as directed relation graphs and leverages graph prompts to enhance the instruction following capabilities of LLMs. GraphIF comprises three key components: (1) an agent-based relation extraction module that captures inter-turn semantic relations via action-triggered mechanisms to construct structured graphs; (2) a relation graph prompt generation module that converts structured graph information into natural language prompts; and (3) a response rewriting module that refines initial LLM outputs using the generated graph prompts. Extensive experiments on two long multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that GraphIF can be seamlessly integrated into instruction-tuned LLMs and leads to significant improvements across all four multi-turn instruction-following evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "GraphIF\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGraphIF\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e3a\u6709\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "GraphIF\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLM\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "GraphIF\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We prove that an idealized JEPA loss is minimized when the encoder represents the system's regime indicator functions, which are Koopman eigenfunctions. This theory was validated on synthetic data with known dynamics, demonstrating that constraining the JEPA's linear predictor to be a near-identity operator is the key inductive bias that forces the encoder to learn these invariants.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts. Significant performance improvements on the Diverse Weather dataset and Real-to-Art benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method.

This paper proposes CaReTS, a novel multi-task learning framework that combines classification and regression tasks for multi-step time series forecasting problems. The framework adopts a dual-stream architecture, where a classification branch learns the stepwise trend into the future, while a regression branch estimates the corresponding deviations from the latest observation of the target variable. The dual-stream design provides more interpretable predictions by disentangling macro-level trends from micro-level deviations in the target variable.

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4ea4\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e2e\u52a9\u5ba1\u7a3f\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u5217\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u5219\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

In real-world problems, the best arm needs to satisfy additional feasibility constraints. While there is limited prior work on BAI with feasibility constraints, they typically assume the performance and constraints are observed simultaneously on each pull of an arm. However, this assumption does not reflect most practical use cases, e.g., in drug discovery, we wish to find the most potent drug whose toxicity and solubility are below certain safety thresholds. These safety experiments can be conducted separately from the potency measurement. Thus, this requires designing BAI algorithms that not only decide which arm to pull but also decide whether to test for the arm's performance or feasibility. In this work, we study feasible BAI which allows a decision-maker to choose a tuple $(i,\\ell)$, where $i\\in [K]$ denotes an arm and $\\ell$ denotes whether she wishes to test for its performance ($\\ell=0$) or any of its $N$ feasibility constraints ($\\ell\\in[N]$). We focus on the fixed confidence setting, which is to identify the \\textit{feasible} arm with the \\textit{highest performance}, with a probability of at least $1-\u03b4$. We propose an efficient algorithm and upper-bound its sample complexity, showing our algorithm can naturally adapt to the problem's difficulty and eliminate arms by worse performance or infeasibility, whichever is easier. We complement this upper bound with a lower bound showing that our algorithm is \\textit{asymptotically ($\u03b4\\rightarrow 0$) optimal}.

Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples.

Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition.

Even for just two halfspaces, it remains a major open question whether learning is possible in polynomial time with respect to the margin $\u03b3$ of the data points and their dimensionality $d$. The best-known algorithms run in quasi-polynomial time $d^{O(\\log(1/\u03b3))}$, and it has been shown that this complexity is unavoidable for any algorithm relying solely on correlational statistical queries (CSQ).\n  In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that provably circumvents the CSQ hardness barrier. Our approach applies to a broad class of distributions satisfying a natural, previously studied, factorizability assumption. Factorizable distributions lie between distribution-specific and distribution-free settings, and significantly extend previously known tractable cases. Under these distributions, we show that CSQ-based methods still require quasipolynomial time even for weakly learning, whereas our algorithm achieves $poly(d,1/\u03b3)$ time by leveraging more general statistical queries (SQ), establishing a strong separation between CSQ and SQ for this simple realizable PAC learning problem.\n  Our result is grounded in a rigorous analysis utilizing a novel duality framework that characterizes the moment tensor structure induced by the marginal distributions. Building on these structural insights, we propose new, efficient learning algorithms.

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue.

The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms a baseline YOLOv5m model, achieving a significant mAP@0.5 boost ($31.12\\%$ to $46.61\\%$) while maintaining real-time detection latency. Furthermore, we show that supplementing our pseudo-labelled data with a small fraction of ground truth labels ($10\\%$) leads to further performance gains, reaching $57.97\\%$ mAP@0.5 on the KITTI dataset.

Its main limitation is drafter-verifier misalignment, which limits token acceptance and reduces overall effectiveness. While small drafting heads trained from scratch compensate with speed, they struggle when verification dominates latency or when inputs are out of distribution. In contrast, pretrained drafters, though slower, achieve higher acceptance rates thanks to stronger standalone generation capabilities, making them competitive when drafting latency is negligible relative to verification or communication overhead. In this work, we aim to improve the acceptance rates of pretrained drafters by introducing a lightweight dynamic alignment mechanism: a steering vector computed from the verifier's hidden states and injected into the pretrained drafter. Compared to existing offline alignment methods such as distillation, our approach boosts the number of accepted tokens by up to 35\\% under standard sampling and 22\\% under greedy sampling, all while incurring negligible computational overhead.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns.

Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances.

However, a static model trained on a single dataset fails to adapt to the dynamically evolving clinical environment and continuous data streams, limiting its practical utility. While continual learning (CL) offers a solution to learn dynamically from new datasets, existing CL methods primarily focus on unimodal inputs and suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting in survival prediction. In real-world scenarios, multimodal inputs often provide comprehensive and complementary information, such as whole slide images and genomics; and neglecting inter-modal correlations negatively impacts the performance. To address the two challenges of catastrophic forgetting and complex inter-modal interactions between gigapixel whole slide images and genomics, we propose ConSurv, the first multimodal continual learning (MMCL) method for survival analysis. ConSurv incorporates two key components: Multi-staged Mixture of Experts (MS-MoE) and Feature Constrained Replay (FCR). MS-MoE captures both task-shared and task-specific knowledge at different learning stages of the network, including two modality encoders and the modality fusion component, learning inter-modal relationships. FCR further enhances learned knowledge and mitigates forgetting by restricting feature deviation of previous data at different levels, including encoder-level features of two modalities and the fusion-level representations. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark integrating four datasets, Multimodal Survival Analysis Incremental Learning (MSAIL), for comprehensive evaluation in the CL setting.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers.

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u8861\uff08DiVE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728ID\u3001OOD\u548c\u96f6shot\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728OOD\u548c\u96f6shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff1a\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff08AVL\uff09\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff08PVL\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ea6\u675f\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "DiVE\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728ID\uff0cOOD\u548c\u96f6shot\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u8861\uff08DiVE\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728ID\uff0cOOD\u548c\u96f6shot\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet these systems still lack reliable mechanisms to guarantee that sensitive information can be permanently removed once it has been used. Retraining from the beginning is prohibitively costly, and existing unlearning methods remain fragmented, difficult to verify, and often vulnerable to recovery. This paper surveys recent research on machine unlearning for LLMs and considers how far current approaches can address these challenges. We review methods for evaluating whether forgetting has occurred, the resilience of unlearned models against adversarial attacks, and mechanisms that can support user trust when model complexity or proprietary limits restrict transparency. Technical solutions such as differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, federated learning, and ephemeral memory are examined alongside institutional safeguards including auditing practices and regulatory frameworks. The review finds steady progress, but robust and verifiable unlearning is still unresolved. Efficient techniques that avoid costly retraining, stronger defenses against adversarial recovery, and governance structures that reinforce accountability are needed if LLMs are to be deployed safely in sensitive applications.

We introduce an uncertainty-guided approach for checkpoint selection (UGCS) that avoids these pitfalls. Our method identifies hard question-answer pairs using per-sample uncertainty and ranks checkpoints by how well they handle these challenging cases. By averaging the rewards of the top-uncertain samples over a short training window, our method produces a stable and discriminative signal without additional forward passes or significant computation overhead.

Chaturvedi", "Gaurav Bagwe", "Lan Zhang", "Pan He", "Xiaoyong Yuan"], "title": "MOBA: A Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack against LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection Systems", "comment": "Accepted at AAAI 2026 Conference", "summary": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection is widely used in safety-critical systems. However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Anchor-based Fair Clustering Framework (AFCF), a novel, general, and plug-and-play framework that empowers arbitrary fair clustering algorithms with linear-time scalability. Our approach first selects a small but representative set of anchors using a novel fair sampling strategy. Then, any off-the-shelf fair clustering algorithm can be applied to this small anchor set. The core of our framework lies in a novel anchor graph construction module, where we formulate an optimization problem to propagate labels while preserving fairness. This is achieved through a carefully designed group-label joint constraint, which we prove theoretically ensures that the fairness of the final clustering on the entire dataset matches that of the anchor clustering. We solve this optimization efficiently using an ADMM-based algorithm.

Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively. Extensive experiments show that LampQ provides the state-of-the-art performance in quantizing ViTs pre-trained on various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and zero-shot quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "LampQ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ViTs\u5c42\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MPQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9ViT\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u7cd9\u3001\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u4f4d\u5bbd\u5206\u914d\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4d\u5bbd\u5206\u914d\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7LampQ, \u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LampQ\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86ViTs\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd, \u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MPQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the most widely used non-invasive tool for cardiac assessment, yet large, well-annotated ECG corpora are scarce due to cost, privacy, and workflow constraints. Generating ECGs can be beneficial for the mechanistic understanding of cardiac electrical activity, enable the construction of large, heterogeneous, and unbiased datasets, and facilitate privacy-preserving data sharing. Generating realistic ECG signals from clinical context is important yet underexplored. Recent work has leveraged diffusion models for text-to-ECG generation, but two challenges remain: (i) existing methods often overlook the physiological simulator knowledge of cardiac activity; and (ii) they ignore broader, experience-based clinical knowledge grounded in real-world practice. To address these gaps, we propose SE-Diff, a novel physiological simulator and experience enhanced diffusion model for comprehensive ECG generation. SE-Diff integrates a lightweight ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based ECG simulator into the diffusion process via a beat decoder and simulator-consistent constraints, injecting mechanistic priors that promote physiologically plausible waveforms. In parallel, we design an LLM-powered experience retrieval-augmented strategy to inject clinical knowledge, providing more guidance for ECG generation. Extensive experiments on real-world ECG datasets demonstrate that SE-Diff improves both signal fidelity and text-ECG semantic alignment over baselines, proving its superiority for text-to-ECG generation. We further show that the simulator-based and experience-based knowledge also benefit downstream ECG classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSE-Diff\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u4ea1\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bSE-Diff\uff0c\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u666e\u901a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08ODE\uff09\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u8df3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "SE-Diff\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e5f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SE-Diff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4e5f\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing. Practical Implications - ATR4CH enables Cultural Heritage institutions to systematically convert textual knowledge into queryable KGs, supporting automated metadata enrichment and knowledge discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATR4CH\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6587\u672c\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "ATR4CH\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6ce8\u91ca\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5143\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ATR4CH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u5316\u9057\u4ea7\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions.

We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.\n  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated.

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3 RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9010\u6e10\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3 RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e LLM \u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\u3002", "result": "TruthfulRAG \u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG \u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8 RAG \u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

However, prevailing unsupervised GAD methods typically presuppose complete node attributes and structure information, a condition hardly satisfied in real-world scenarios owing to privacy, collection errors or dynamic node arrivals. Existing standard imputation schemes risk \"repairing\" rare anomalous nodes so that they appear normal, thereby introducing imputation bias into the detection process. In addition, when both node attributes and edges are missing simultaneously, estimation errors in one view can contaminate the other, causing cross-view interference that further undermines the detection performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose M$^2$V-UGAD, a multiple missing values-resistant unsupervised GAD framework on incomplete graphs. Specifically, a dual-pathway encoder is first proposed to independently reconstruct missing node attributes and graph structure, thereby preventing errors in one view from propagating to the other. The two pathways are then fused and regularized in a joint latent space so that normals occupy a compact inner manifold while anomalies reside on an outer shell. Lastly, to mitigate imputation bias, we sample latent codes just outside the normal region and decode them into realistic node features and subgraphs, providing hard negative examples that sharpen the decision boundary. Experiments on seven public benchmarks demonstrate that M$^2$V-UGAD consistently outperforms existing unsupervised GAD methods across varying missing rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "M$^2$V-UGAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM$^2$V-UGAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8054\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cM$^2$V-UGAD\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "M$^2$V-UGAD\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs.

Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances. Given a specific instantiation, we generate corresponding Lean definitions and instance declarations, integrate them using Lean's typeclass mechanism, and construct verified theorems by checking structural assumptions.

To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner.

While MLP-based methods have gained attention for achieving Transformer-comparable performance with fewer parameters and better robustness, they face critical limitations including loss of weak seasonal signals, capacity constraints in weight-sharing MLPs, and insufficient channel fusion in channel-independent strategies. To address these challenges, we propose MDMLP-EIA (Multi-domain Dynamic MLPs with Energy Invariant Attention) with three key innovations. First, we develop an adaptive fused dual-domain seasonal MLP that categorizes seasonal signals into strong and weak components. It employs an adaptive zero-initialized channel fusion strategy to minimize noise interference while effectively integrating predictions. Second, we introduce an energy invariant attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on different feature channels within trend and seasonal predictions across time steps. This mechanism maintains constant total signal energy to align with the decomposition-prediction-reconstruction framework and enhance robustness against disturbances. Third, we propose a dynamic capacity adjustment mechanism for channel-independent MLPs. This mechanism scales neuron count with the square root of channel count, ensuring sufficient capacity as channels increase.

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

They treat the detection threshold as a fixed hyperparameter, set once to balance false alarms and late detections, and applied uniformly across all datasets and over time. However, maintaining model performance is the key objective from the perspective of machine learning, and we observe that model performance is highly sensitive to this threshold. This observation inspires us to investigate whether a dynamic threshold could be provably better. In this paper, we prove that a threshold that adapts over time can outperform any single fixed threshold. The main idea of the proof is that a dynamic strategy, constructed by combining the best threshold from each individual data segment, is guaranteed to outperform any single threshold that apply to all segments. Based on the theorem, we propose a Dynamic Threshold Determination algorithm. It enhances existing drift detection frameworks with a novel comparison phase to inform how the threshold should be adjusted.

However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step.

We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning. Multivariate Gaussian Representation projects the joint motions to a temporally scaled multi-dimensional space, and decomposes actions into adaptive 3D Gaussians that serve as tokens.

Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features.

Also, existing MTL approaches for tabular data predominantly rely on multi-layer perceptron-based backbones, which struggle to capture complex feature interactions and often fail to scale when data is abundant, a limitation that transformer architectures have overcome in other domains.

We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faS4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u793a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528S4F\u5bf9\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u6349\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

Rigorous evaluation and effective training for such capabilities are hindered by the lack of high-quality, human-annotated benchmarks and reliable, interpretable reward signals. In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity.

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlobalDiff\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5171\u8bed\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684GlobalDiff\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5171\u8bed\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cGlobalDiff\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8646.0%\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "GlobalDiff improves co-speech motion generation by utilizing global joint rotations and enforcing multi-level structural constraints, leading to smoother and more accurate motion outputs."}}

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b75336\u4e2a\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6d88\u606f\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe70-82%\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728150\u6b21\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ec5\u4e3a30-45%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u5e94\u83b7\u5f97\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5c06\u4e00\u822c\u7684RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u3002"}}

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684GridPrune\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fee\u526a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u4fee\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\u9009\u62e9\u5143\u7d20\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cGridPrune\u501f\u9274\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "GridPrune\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4fee\u526a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u533a\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "GridPrune\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728LLaVA-NeXT-7B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u752811.1%\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8696.98%\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4fee\u526a\u7387\u4e0b\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.34%\u3002", "conclusion": "GridPrune\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u2018\u5168\u5c40\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u9009\u62e9\u2019\u7684\u533a\u57df\u9009\u62e9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002"}}

However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteristics and intervention dynamics. We propose a novel bi-level contextual bandit framework for individualized resource allocation under delayed feedback, designed to operate in real-world settings with dynamic populations, capacity constraints, and time-sensitive impact. At the meta level, the model optimizes subgroup-level budget allocations to satisfy fairness and operational constraints. At the base level, it identifies the most responsive individuals within each group using a neural network trained on observational data, while respecting cooldown windows and delayed treatment effects modeled via resource-specific delay kernels. By explicitly modeling temporal dynamics and feedback delays, the algorithm continually refines its policy as new data arrive, enabling more responsive and adaptive decision-making. We validate our approach on two real-world datasets from education and workforce development, showing that it achieves higher cumulative outcomes, better adapts to delay structures, and ensures equitable distribution across subgroups.

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction.

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description.

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text.

In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality.

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations.

We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

However, the representational capacity of INR defined by the range of functions the neural network can characterize, is inherently limited by the low-dimensional feature space in conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) architectures. While widening the MLP can linearly increase feature space dimensionality, it also leads to a quadratic growth in computational and memory costs. To address this limitation, we propose the split-layer, a novel reformulation of MLP construction. The split-layer divides each layer into multiple parallel branches and integrates their outputs via Hadamard product, effectively constructing a high-degree polynomial space. This approach significantly enhances INR's representational capacity by expanding the feature space dimensionality without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the split-layer substantially improves INR performance, surpassing existing methods across multiple tasks, including 2D image fitting, 2D CT reconstruction, 3D shape representation, and 5D novel view synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684MLP\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5split-layer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u7684\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528split-layer\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c42\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Hadamard\u79ef\u6574\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u9636\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528split-layer\u540e\u57282D\u56fe\u50cf\u62df\u5408\u30012D CT\u91cd\u5efa\u30013D\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u548c5D\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684split-layer\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite many recent works on structure tokenization, the properties of the underlying discrete representations are not well understood. In this work, we first demonstrate that the successful utilization of structural tokens in a language model for structure prediction depends on using rich, pre-trained sequence embeddings to bridge the semantic gap between the sequence and structural \"language\". The analysis of the structural vocabulary itself then reveals significant semantic redundancy, where multiple distinct tokens correspond to nearly identical local geometries, acting as \"structural synonyms\". This redundancy, rather than being a flaw, can be exploited with a simple \"synonym swap\" strategy to generate diverse conformational ensembles by perturbing a predicted structure with its structural synonyms. This computationally lightweight method accurately recapitulates protein flexibility, performing competitively with state-of-the-art models.

Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5404\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u534f\u4f5c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

While quantum circuits are not naturally measured in floating point operations (FLOPs), most HQNNs (in NISQ era) are still trained on classical simulators where FLOPs directly dictate runtime and scalability. Hence, FLOPs represent a practical and viable metric to measure the computational complexity of HQNNs. In this work, we introduce FAQNAS, a FLOPs-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework that formulates HQNN design as a multi-objective optimization problem balancing accuracy and FLOPs. Unlike traditional approaches, FAQNAS explicitly incorporates FLOPs into the optimization objective, enabling the discovery of architectures that achieve strong performance while minimizing computational cost. Experiments on five benchmark datasets (MNIST, Digits, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Iris) show that quantum FLOPs dominate accuracy improvements, while classical FLOPs remain largely fixed. Pareto-optimal solutions reveal that competitive accuracy can often be achieved with significantly reduced computational cost compared to FLOPs-agnostic baselines.

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

The goal of the attack is to modify the original explanations while being undetected by the human eye and maintain the same predicted class. In contrast to previous methods, we do not require any access to the model or its weights, but only to the model's computed predictions and explanations. Additionally, the attack is accomplished in a single step while significantly changing the provided explanations, as demonstrated by empirical evaluation. The low requirements of our method expose a critical vulnerability in current explainability methods, raising concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. We systematically generate attacks based on the explanations generated by post-hoc explainability methods (saliency maps, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT SHAP) for pretrained ResNet-18 and ViT-B16 on ImageNet. The results show that our attacks could lead to dramatically different explanations without changing the predictive probabilities.

However, their strategic deployment raises critical concerns for responsible AI management, particularly regarding the reproduction and amplification of race- and gender-related stereotypes that can undermine organizational ethics. In this work, we investigate whether such societal biases are systematically encoded within the pretrained latent spaces of state-of-the-art T2I models. We conduct an empirical study across the five most popular open-source models, using ten neutral, profession-related prompts to generate 100 images per profession, resulting in a dataset of 5,000 images evaluated by diverse human assessors representing different races and genders. We demonstrate that all five models encode and amplify pronounced societal skew: caregiving and nursing roles are consistently feminized, while high-status professions such as corporate CEO, politician, doctor, and lawyer are overwhelmingly represented by males and mostly White individuals.

By training on intermediate representations from a physical plausibility classifier and leveraging large multimodal models for interpretation, our method identifies diverse physics-related failure modes without manual feature engineering, achieving superior feature relevance and feature accuracy compared to existing approaches.

On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Residual-Informed Loss (RI-Loss), a novel objective function based on the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). RI-Loss explicitly models noise structure by enforcing dependence between the residual sequence and a random time series, enabling more robust, noise-aware representations. Theoretically, we derive the first non-asymptotic HSIC bound with explicit double-sample complexity terms, achieving optimal convergence rates through Bernstein-type concentration inequalities and Rademacher complexity analysis.

This paper presents Energy Preference Optimization (EPO), an online refinement algorithm that turns a pretrained protein ensemble generator into an energy-aware sampler without extra MD trajectories. Specifically, EPO leverages stochastic differential equation sampling to explore the conformational landscape and incorporates a novel energy-ranking mechanism based on list-wise preference optimization. Crucially, EPO introduces a practical upper bound to efficiently approximate the intractable probability of long sampling trajectories in continuous-time generative models, making it easily adaptable to existing pretrained generators. On Tetrapeptides, ATLAS, and Fast-Folding benchmarks, EPO successfully generates diverse and physically realistic ensembles, establishing a new state-of-the-art in nine evaluation metrics.

Current deep learning-based forecasting models primarily employ Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss functions for regression modeling. Despite enabling direct value prediction, this method offers no uncertainty estimation and exhibits poor outlier robustness. To address these limitations, we propose OCE-TS, a novel ordinal classification approach for time series forecasting that replaces MSE with Ordinal Cross-Entropy (OCE) loss, preserving prediction order while quantifying uncertainty through probability output. Specifically, OCE-TS begins by discretizing observed values into ordered intervals and deriving their probabilities via a parametric distribution as supervision signals. Using a simple linear model, we then predict probability distributions for each timestep. The OCE loss is computed between the cumulative distributions of predicted and ground-truth probabilities, explicitly preserving ordinal relationships among forecasted values. Through theoretical analysis using influence functions, we establish that cross-entropy (CE) loss exhibits superior stability and outlier robustness compared to MSE loss.

Drawing inspiration from the multiscale dynamics of biological attention and from dynamical systems theory, we introduce Fractional Neural Attention (FNA), a principled, neuroscience-inspired framework for multiscale information processing. FNA models token interactions through L\u00e9vy diffusion governed by the fractional Laplacian, intrinsically realizing simultaneous short- and long-range dependencies across multiple scales. This mechanism yields greater expressivity and faster information mixing, advancing the foundational capacity of Transformers. Theoretically, we show that FNA's dynamics are governed by the fractional diffusion equation, and that the resulting attention networks exhibit larger spectral gaps and shorter path lengths -- mechanistic signatures of enhanced computational efficiency. Empirically, FNA achieves competitive text-classification performance even with a single layer and a single head; it also improves performance in image processing and neural machine translation. Finally, the diffusion map algorithm from geometric harmonics enables dimensionality reduction of FNA weights while preserving the intrinsic structure of embeddings and hidden states.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations.

More importantly, hierarchical architecture shifts participation from individual clients to client groups, thereby further intensifying this issue. Despite notable advancements in SAFL research, most existing works still focus on conventional cloud-end architectures while largely overlooking the critical impact of non-IID data on scheduling across the cloud-edge-client hierarchy. To tackle these challenges, we propose FedCure, an innovative semi-asynchronous Federated learning framework that leverages coalition construction and participation-aware scheduling to mitigate participation bias with non-IID data. Specifically, FedCure operates through three key rules: (1) a preference rule that optimizes coalition formation by maximizing collective benefits and establishing theoretically stable partitions to reduce non-IID-induced performance degradation; (2) a scheduling rule that integrates the virtual queue technique with Bayesian-estimated coalition dynamics, mitigating efficiency loss while ensuring mean rate stability; and (3) a resource allocation rule that enhances computational efficiency by optimizing client CPU frequencies based on estimated coalition dynamics while satisfying delay requirements. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedCure improves accuracy by up to 5.1x compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, while significantly enhancing efficiency with the lowest coefficient of variation 0.0223 for per-round latency and maintaining long-term balance across diverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedCure\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u534a\u5f02\u6b65\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u76df\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u5ea6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "FedCure\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u6bd4\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u9ad85.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCure\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u53c2\u4e0e\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate how LayerNorm influences memorization and learning for Pre- and Post-LayerNorm transformers. We identify that LayerNorm serves as a key factor for stable learning in Pre-LayerNorm transformers, while in Post-LayerNorm transformers, it impacts memorization. Our analysis reveals that eliminating LayerNorm parameters in Pre-LayerNorm models exacerbates memorization and destabilizes learning, while in Post-LayerNorm models, it effectively mitigates memorization by restoring genuine labels. We further precisely identify that early layers LayerNorm are the most critical over middle/later layers and their influence varies across Pre and Post LayerNorm models.

Existing post-training paradigms are limited: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) relies on costly step-level annotations, while Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods like GRPO provide only sparse, outcome-level feedback, hindering stable optimization. We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Operating on sequential graph serializations, LLMs can produce different outputs under node reindexing, edge reordering, or formatting changes, raising robustness concerns.

We propose a principled decomposition of graph serializations into node labeling, edge encoding, and syntax, and evaluate LLM robustness to variations of each of these factors on a comprehensive benchmarking suite. We also contribute a novel set of spectral tasks to further assess generalization abilities of fine-tuned reasoners. Results show that larger (non-fine-tuned) models are more robust. Fine-tuning reduces sensitivity to node relabeling but may increase it to variations in structure and format, while it does not consistently improve performance on unseen tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u56fe\u5f62\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u7d22\u5f15\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u56fe\u5f62\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u654f\u611f\u6027\u53ca\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56fe\u5f62\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u5404\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5fc5\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u5927\u7684\uff08\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8282\u70b9\u91cd\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context. Extensive experiments on key hallucination benchmarks, including POPE and CHAIR, indicate that RUDDER achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while introducing negligible computational latency, validating RUDDER as a pragmatic and effective approach for improving LVLMs' reliability without a significant compromise on efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faRUDDER\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584LVLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "LVLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "RUDDER\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6b8b\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\uff08CARD\uff09\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u5bfcLVLMs\u671d\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u624e\u6839\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "RUDDER\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982POPE\u548cCHAIR\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "RUDDER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most studies tackle this bias by balancing distributions globally, but ignore individual heterogeneity and fail to capture the local structure that represents the natural clustering among individuals, which ultimately compromises ITE estimation. While instance-level alignment methods consider heterogeneity, they similarly overlook the local structure information. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Multi-\\textbf{P}rototype alignment method for \\textbf{ITE} estimation (\\textbf{PITE}). PITE effectively captures local structure within groups and enforces cross-group alignment, thereby achieving robust ITE estimation. Specifically, we first define prototypes as cluster centroids based on similar individuals under the same treatment. To identify local similarity and the distribution consistency, we perform instance-to-prototype matching to assign individuals to the nearest prototype within groups, and design a multi-prototype alignment strategy to encourage the matched prototypes to be close across treatment arms in the latent space. PITE not only reduces distribution shift through fine-grained, prototype-level alignment, but also preserves the local structures of treated and control groups, which provides meaningful constraints for ITE estimation.

Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions.

Though this problem has been extensively studied in previous work, most existing methods remain susceptible to various adversarial attacks. In this paper, we first study DeCMA2B with adversarial corruption, where an adversary can corrupt reward observations of all agents with a limited corruption budget. We propose a robust algorithm, called DeMABAR, which ensures that each agent's individual regret suffers only an additive term proportional to the corruption budget. Then we consider a more realistic scenario where the adversary can only attack a small number of agents. Our theoretical analysis shows that the DeMABAR algorithm can also almost completely eliminate the influence of adversarial attacks and is inherently robust in the Byzantine setting, where an unknown fraction of the agents can be Byzantine, i.e., may arbitrarily select arms and communicate wrong information.

While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains.

We introduce SHRUG-FM, a framework for reliability-aware prediction that integrates three complementary signals: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in the input space, OOD detection in the embedding space and task-specific predictive uncertainty. Applied to burn scar segmentation, SHRUG-FM shows that OOD scores correlate with lower performance in specific environmental conditions, while uncertainty-based flags help discard many poorly performing predictions. Linking these flags to land cover attributes from HydroATLAS shows that failures are not random but concentrated in certain geographies, such as low-elevation zones and large river areas, likely due to underrepresentation in pretraining data.

However, KPKM faces two key limitations: (1) the computational burden of the full kernel matrix restricts its use on extensive data, and (2) the lack of authentic centroid-sample assignment learning reduces its noise robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose RFF-KPKM, introducing the first approximation theory for applying random Fourier features (RFF) to KPKM. RFF-KPKM employs RFF to generate efficient, low-dimensional feature maps, bypassing the need for the whole kernel matrix. Crucially, we are the first to establish strong theoretical guarantees for this combination: (1) an excess risk bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{k^3/n})$, (2) strong consistency with membership values, and (3) a $(1+\\varepsilon)$ relative error bound achievable using the RFF of dimension $\\mathrm{poly}(\\varepsilon^{-1}\\log k)$. Furthermore, to improve robustness and the ability to learn multiple kernels, we propose IP-RFF-MKPKM, an improved possibilistic RFF-based multiple kernel power $k$-means. IP-RFF-MKPKM ensures the scalability of MKPKM via RFF and refines cluster assignments by combining the merits of the possibilistic membership and fuzzy membership.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification.

However, the distributed nature of real-world traffic data across multiple stakeholders poses significant challenges in modeling and reconstructing inter-client spatial dependencies while adhering to data locality constraints. Existing methods primarily address static dependencies, overlooking their dynamic nature and resulting in suboptimal performance. In response, we propose Federated Spatio-Temporal Graph with Dynamic Inter-Client Dependencies (FedSTGD), a framework designed to model and reconstruct dynamic inter-client spatial dependencies in federated learning. FedSTGD incorporates a federated nonlinear computation decomposition module to approximate complex graph operations. This is complemented by a graph node embedding augmentation module, which alleviates performance degradation arising from the decomposition. These modules are coordinated through a client-server collective learning protocol, which decomposes dynamic inter-client spatial dependency learning tasks into lightweight, parallelizable subtasks. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that FedSTGD achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, approaching that of centralized baselines.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties.

To improve robustness, many test-time adaptation (TTA) methods adopt positive data augmentation (PDA), which generates multiple views of each test sample to reduce prediction variance. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations. First, it introduces considerable computational overhead due to the large number of augmentations required per image. Second, it fails to mitigate prediction bias, where the model tends to predict certain classes disproportionately under corruption, as PDA operates on corrupted inputs and typically does not remove the corruption itself. To address these challenges, we propose Panda, a novel TTA method based on negative data augmentation (NDA). Unlike positive augmentations that preserve object semantics, Panda generates negative augmentations by disrupting semantic content. It divides images into patches and randomly assembles them from a shared patch pool. These negatively augmented images retain corruption-specific features while discarding object-relevant signals. We then subtract the mean feature of these negative samples from the original image feature, effectively suppressing corruption-related components while preserving class-relevant information. This mitigates prediction bias under distribution shifts. Panda allows augmentation to be shared across samples within a batch, resulting in minimal computational overhead. Panda can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time adaptation frameworks and substantially improve their robustness. Our experiments indicate that Panda delivers superior performance compared to PDA methods, and a wide range of TTA methods exhibit significantly enhanced performance when integrated with Panda.

However, existing fault detection methods are largely limited to visual recognition, producing structured outputs that lack semantic interpretability and fail to support maintenance decision-making. To address these limitations, this study proposes an integrated framework that combines YOLOMS with a large language model (LLM) for intelligent fault analysis and diagnosis. Specifically, YOLOMS employs multi-scale detection and sliding-window cropping to enhance fault feature extraction, while a lightweight key-value (KV) mapping module bridges the gap between visual outputs and textual inputs. This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a fault detection accuracy of 90.6\\% and generates maintenance reports with an average accuracy of 89\\%, thereby improving the interpretability of diagnostic results and providing practical decision support for the operation and maintenance of wind turbines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210YOLOMS\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u7ef4\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528YOLOMS\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6545\u969c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u952e\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690.6%\u7684\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u574789%\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u62a5\u544a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u529b\u6da1\u8f6e\u673a\u6545\u969c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u7ef4\u62a4\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In Dynamic Tanh (DyT), the author demonstrated that Tanh can be used as an alternative layer normalization (LN) and confirmed the effectiveness of the idea. But Tanh itself faces orthogonality, linearity and distortion problems. Due to that, his proposition cannot be reliable. So we propose a Holonorm (hn) which has residual connections and nonlinearity. Holonorm is suitable for replacing Tanh in the context of normalization. Although the HoloNorm expression could be similar to the softsign function in dimension one, softsign is a componentwise function which is not good for tensors and vectors of great dimension. Holonorm preserves the orthogonality, the direction, the invertibility of the signal. Holonorm is also a suitable metric, maps all vectors into the open unit ball. This prevents exploding activations and improves stability in deep Transformer models. In this work, we have meticulously examined the normalization in transformers and say that Holonorm, a generalized form of softsign function suited as a normalization function first.Second, defined between 0 and 1 hn serves as a percentage, and $1 - \\text{Holonorm}$ is its complement, making it better understandable in evaluating a model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHolonorm\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eTanh\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001Tanh\u5728\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51faHolonorm\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHolonorm\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Tanh\u548csoftsign\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "Holonorm\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6620\u5c04\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u5f00\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u5185\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Holonorm\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u7559\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Large datasets improve model accuracy and generalization but are computationally expensive to produce and train on, while smaller datasets risk discarding rare but important atomic environments and compromising MLIP accuracy/reliability. Here, we develop an information-theoretical framework to quantify the efficiency of dataset compression methods and propose an algorithm that maximizes this efficiency. By framing atomistic dataset compression as an instance of the minimum set cover (MSC) problem over atom-centered environments, our method identifies the smallest subset of structures that contains as much information as possible from the original dataset while pruning redundant information. The approach is extensively demonstrated on the GAP-20 and TM23 datasets, and validated on 64 varied datasets from the ColabFit repository. Across all cases, MSC consistently retains outliers, preserves dataset diversity, and reproduces the long-tail distributions of forces even at high compression rates, outperforming other subsampling methods.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage.

In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years).

Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SemanticVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6307\u4ee4-\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "SemanticVLA\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4OpenVLA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8621.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e863.0\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684SOTA\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

This work introduces a framework to address the need for robust diversity evaluation in T2I models. Our framework systematically assesses diversity by evaluating individual concepts and their relevant factors of variation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel human evaluation template for nuanced diversity assessment; (2) a curated prompt set covering diverse concepts with their identified factors of variation (e.g. prompt: An image of an apple, factor of variation: color); and (3) a methodology for comparing models in terms of human annotations via binomial tests.\n  Furthermore, we rigorously compare various image embeddings for diversity measurement. Notably, our principled approach enables ranking of T2I models by diversity, identifying categories where they particularly struggle.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faCoTyle\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u521b\u9020\u529b\u548c\u8868\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ee5\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u98ce\u683c\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08T2I-DM\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cCoTyle\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CoTyle\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u7801\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models.
