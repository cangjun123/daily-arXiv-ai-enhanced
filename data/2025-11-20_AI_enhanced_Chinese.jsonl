COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding. Across benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates (2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute) while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment.

We refine this picture: for each layer $\\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $\u0394^\\ell \\subset \u0398$ and injective stratum $U^\\ell = \u0398\\setminus \u0394^\\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\\ell_\u03b8$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $\u0398/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes.\n  We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training.

Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks.

Although speech synthesis systems have made significant progress in generating natural and intelligible speech, primarily through architectures that implicitly model prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, the construction of datasets with explicit prosodic segmentation and their impact on spontaneous speech synthesis remains largely unexplored. This paper evaluates the effects of manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations in Brazilian Portuguese on the quality of speech synthesized by a non-autoregressive model, FastSpeech 2. Experimental results show that training with prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and acoustically natural speech. While automatic segmentation tends to create more regular segments, manual prosodic segmentation introduces greater variability, which contributes to more natural prosody. Analysis of neutral declarative utterances showed that both training approaches reproduced the expected nuclear accent pattern, but the prosodic model aligned more closely with natural pre-nuclear contours.

Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios.

A distributed primal-dual algorithm is further developed under this framework, wherein each agent has access only to state-action pairs within its $2\u03ba_p$-hop neighborhood and to reward information within its $\u03ba+ 2\u03ba_p$-hop neighborhood, with $\u03ba> 0$ representing the truncation distance. Moreover, agents are not permitted to directly share their true policy parameters or Lagrange multipliers. Instead, each agent constructs and maintains local estimates of these variables for other agents and employs such estimates to execute its policy. Additionally, these estimates are further updated and exchanged exclusively through an independent, time-varying networks, which enhances the overall system security.

Guided by per-frame depth and content saliency, CPSL decomposes each frame into a small set of geometry-consistent layers equipped with soft alpha bands and an edge-depth cache that jointly preserve occlusion ordering and boundary continuity. These lightweight, 2D-encodable assets enable parallax-corrected novel-view synthesis via depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing, bypassing expensive 3D reconstruction. Temporally, CPSL maintains inter-frame coherence using motion-guided propagation and per-layer encoding, supporting real-time playback with standard video codecs.

Sleep quality (SQ) is vital for physiological and mental health, making its understanding and accurate assessment critical. However, its multifaceted nature, shaped by neurological and environmental factors, makes precise quantification challenging. Here, we address this challenge by utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) for phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) analysis to elucidate the neurological basis of SQ, examining both states of sleep and wakefulness, including resting state (RS) and working memory. Our results revealed distinct patterns in beta power and delta connectivity in sleep and RS, together with the reaction time of working memory.

Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts.

BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model.

The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts.

In an experiment comparing personalized TMR, TMR, and control groups, the personalized protocol significantly reduced memory decay and improved error correction under challenging recall.

Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges.

These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics.

As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment.

While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTP improves long-document embeddings in language models by enhancing information flow and reducing over-compression.", "motivation": "To improve the quality of text embeddings produced by language models, particularly for long documents where traditional methods fail.", "method": "Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP) partitions the input into blocks and uses block-level summary tokens along with mean-pooling at readout level.", "result": "HTP consistently outperforms existing methods on 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context scenarios.", "conclusion": "HTP is an effective method that enhances the performance of language models on long documents by addressing attention-level compression and readout-level over-squashing."}}

These include:a) long-range user interactions (implicit and explicit) spanning both digital and physical channels generating temporally heterogeneous context, b) the presence of multiple interrelated products require coordinated models to support varied ad placements and personalized feeds, while balancing competing business goals. We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products.

The framework generates near-term forecasts directly from current conditions, supports data assimilation with sparse observations, and enables rapid exploration of what-if routing scenarios.

Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316eVTOL\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u52a8\u5782\u76f4\u8d77\u964d(eVTOL)\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u57ce\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u62e5\u5835\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u6700\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8d77\u98de\u8f68\u8ff9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u9700$4.57\times10^6$\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8697.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

We propose InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix), a framework that distills the editing capabilities of a 2D diffusion model into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, leveraging its data-driven 3D prior for cross-view consistency. A key contribution is replacing the conventional neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a multi-view diffusion student, which requires novel adaptations: incremental student updates across timesteps, a specialized teacher noise scheduler to prevent degeneration, and an attention modification that enhances cross-view coherence without additional cost.

Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TASA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u8f85\u5bfc\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5b66\u751f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u638c\u63e1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TASA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7279\u70b9\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "TASA\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8f85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bf9\u9057\u5fd8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TASA\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u9057\u5fd8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u548c\u66f4\u5177\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive \"space-ification\" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters.

SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data.

To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu.

Reliability-Optimized LLMs with Inspectable Tools", "comment": "Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop on Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot.

However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval.

To address these challenges, we developed DesignerlyLoop, a visual node-based system that embeds LLM reasoning chains into the design workflow. The system enables designers to externalize and curate reasoning structures, iteratively organize intentions, and interact with LLMs as dynamic cognitive engines rather than static answer providers. We conducted a within-subject study with 20 designers, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and found that DesignerlyLoop enhanced creative reflection, design quality, and interaction experience by supporting systematic engagement with both human and machine reasoning.

We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text \"representationally simple\" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively \"easy\", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom.

Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction.

GeneGPT addressed this challenge by combining domain-specific APIs with OpenAI's code-davinci-002 large language model to enable natural language interaction with genomic databases. However, its reliance on a proprietary model limits scalability, increases operational costs, and raises concerns about data privacy and generalization.\n  In this work, we revisit and reproduce GeneGPT in a pilot study using open source models, including Llama 3.1, Qwen2.5, and Qwen2.5 Coder, within a monolithic architecture; this allows us to identify the limitations of this approach. Building on this foundation, we then develop OpenBioLLM, a modular multi-agent framework that extends GeneGPT by introducing agent specialization for tool routing, query generation, and response validation. This enables coordinated reasoning and role-based task execution.\n  OpenBioLLM matches or outperforms GeneGPT on over 90% of the benchmark tasks, achieving average scores of 0.849 on Gene-Turing and 0.830 on GeneHop, while using smaller open-source models without additional fine-tuning or tool-specific pretraining.

While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges.

Kalra", "Pingkun Yan"], "title": "X-WIN: Building Chest Radiograph World Model via Predictive Sensing", "comment": null, "summary": "Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is an essential medical imaging technique for disease diagnosis. However, as 2D projectional images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition and hence fail to capture 3D anatomies. This limitation makes representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel CXR world model named X-WIN, which distills volumetric knowledge from chest computed tomography (CT) by learning to predict its 2D projections in latent space. The core idea is that a world model with internalized knowledge of 3D anatomical structure can predict CXRs under various transformations in 3D space. During projection prediction, we introduce an affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss that leverages mutual similarities to capture rich, correlated information across projections from the same volume.

Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

To address this gap, we designed and evaluated an LLM-powered, task-based role-playing game in which a GPT-4o-based Game Master guides learners through an immersive, three-phase spoken narrative. After selecting five unfamiliar slang phrases to practice, participants engage in open-ended dialogue with non-player characters; the Game Master naturally incorporates the target phrases in rich semantic contexts (implicit input enhancement) while a dedicated Practice Box provides real-time explicit tracking and encouragement. Post-session, learners receive multi-level formative feedback analyzing the entire interaction.\n  We evaluated the system in a between-subjects study with 14 international graduate students, randomly assigned to either the RPG condition or a control condition consisting of a traditional AI-led virtual classroom.

Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Graph Memory (GM) is a non-parametric framework that enhances inference and explanation by summarizing the embedding space into relational prototypes.", "motivation": "The aim is to improve embedding-based inference by leveraging a relational memory that captures geometric and contextual relationships, enhancing explanation and efficiency.", "method": "GM employs a structured, non-parametric approach to organize training instances into prototype nodes with reliability indicators and contextual edges.", "result": "GM demonstrates competitive accuracy compared to $k$NN and Label Spreading, improves calibration, and achieves smoother decision boundaries on various datasets.", "conclusion": "Graph Memory (GM) provides a unified framework for instance retrieval and reasoning, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer samples."}}

While short-term periodic activities -- characterized by simple structures and high-contrast patterns -- have been widely studied, long-term periodic workflows with low-contrast patterns remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark comprising 580 multimodal human activity sequences featuring long-term periodic workflows. The benchmark supports three evaluation tasks aligned with real-world applications: unsupervised periodic workflow detection, task completion tracking, and procedural anomaly detection. We also propose a lightweight, training-free baseline for modeling diverse periodic workflow patterns. Experiments show that: (i) our benchmark presents significant challenges to both unsupervised periodic detection methods and zero-shot approaches based on powerful large language models (LLMs); (ii) our baseline outperforms competing methods by a substantial margin in all evaluation tasks; and (iii) in real-world applications, our baseline demonstrates deployment advantages on par with traditional supervised workflow detection approaches, eliminating the need for annotation and retraining.

However, synchronizing multiple cameras remains a significant challenge, especially in heterogeneous setups combining professional and consumer-grade devices, visible and infrared sensors, or systems with and without audio, where common hardware synchronization capabilities are often unavailable. This limitation is particularly evident in real-world environments, where controlled capture conditions are not feasible. In this work, we present a low-cost, general-purpose synchronization method that achieves millisecond-level temporal alignment across diverse camera systems while supporting both visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities. The proposed solution employs a custom-built \\textit{LED Clock} that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of the exposure window (start and end times) from recorded frames for millisecond-level synchronization. We benchmark our method against hardware synchronization and achieve a residual error of 1.34~ms RMSE across multiple recordings. In further experiments, our method outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based synchronization approaches and directly improves downstream computer vision tasks, including multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Finally, we validate the system in large-scale surgical recordings involving over 25 heterogeneous cameras spanning both IR and RGB modalities. This solution simplifies and streamlines the synchronization pipeline and expands access to advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained environments, including industrial and clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u7684LED\u65f6\u949f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u540c\u6b65\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u7684LED\u65f6\u949f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\uff08RGB\uff09\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\uff08IR\uff09\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f55\u5236\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.34\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7801\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c3D\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u540e\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u540c\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%.

Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches.

Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes.

Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c1120%\u81f350%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709CO2\u6fc0\u5149\u62bd\u5438\u6cf5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u62bd\u5438\u6cf5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u70df\u96fe\u6c34\u5e73\u68c0\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6cf5\u7684\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u70df\u96fe\u5438\u5c18\u6cf5\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8620%\u81f350%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u73af\u4fdd\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6fc0\u5149\u5207\u5272\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds.\n  We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen\" (training data) and ``unseen\" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\\% balanced accuracy.

Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time.

We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels.

However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u957f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u878d\u5408\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u5404\u5f02\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f62\u6210CDSS\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5728\u9650\u5236\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728 MIT-BIH \u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c MIT-BIH \u623f\u98a4\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728 10 \u7c7b\u548c 4 \u7c7b\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8696.45%\u548c97.57%\u7684 F1 \u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches.

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u7684TDAM-CRC\u6a21\u578b\u5728CRC\u7684\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfTNM\u5206\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3CRC\u7684\u9884\u540e\u5206\u5c42\u96be\u9898", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bTDAM-CRC\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5168\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7ec4\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027", "result": "TDAM-CRC\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u671f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u540e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86MRPL37\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u56e0\uff0c\u4e14\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542bTDAM-CRC\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "TDAM-CRC\u6a21\u578b\u5728CRC\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations. Regarding AI risk, they generate categorically different assessments: realists view superintelligence as the primary risk and search for unified alignment solutions, while pluralists see diverse threats across different domains requiring context-specific solutions.

Financial documents contain visually dense and table heavy layouts where numerical and temporal information is tightly coupled with structure. In high stakes settings, small OCR mistakes such as sign inversion or shifted dates can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics like ROUGE and edit distance capture only surface level text similarity. \\ficriticaled provides 500 image-HTML pairs with expert annotated financial facts covering over seven hundred numerical and temporal facts. It introduces three key contributions. First, it establishes the first fact level evaluation benchmark for financial document understanding, shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to domain critical factual correctness. Second, all annotations are created and verified by financial experts with strict quality control over signs, magnitudes, and temporal expressions. Third, we develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline that performs structured fact extraction and contextual verification for visually complex financial documents.

Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly.

To achieve continuous all-day person matching across day and night, Visible-Infrared Lifelong person Re-IDentification (VI-LReID) focuses on sequential training on data from visible and infrared modalities and pursues average performance over all data. To this end, existing methods typically exploit cross-modal knowledge distillation to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. However, these methods ignore the mutual interference of modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, where conflicting knowledge leads to collaborative forgetting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment method, called CKDA, which explicitly separates and preserves modality-specific knowledge and modality-common knowledge in a balanced way. Specifically, a Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) module and a Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) module are proposed to explicitly disentangle and purify discriminative information that coexists and is specific to different modalities, avoiding the mutual interference between both knowledge. In addition, a Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module is designed to further align the disentangled new knowledge with the old one in two mutually independent inter- and intra-modality feature spaces based on dual-modality prototypes in a balanced manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our CKDA against state-of-the-art methods.

Cognitive scientists have investigated the mechanisms that underlie our ability to thinking geometrically and numerically, to take two prominent examples, and developmental scientists have documented the trajectories of these abilities over the lifespan. Prior research has shown that computer vision (CV) models trained on the unrelated task of image classification nevertheless learn latent representations of geometric and numerical concepts similar to those of adults. Building on this demonstrated cognitive alignment, the current study investigates whether CV models also show developmental alignment: whether their performance improvements across training to match the developmental progressions observed in children. In a detailed case study of the ResNet-50 model, we show that this is the case. For the case of geometry and topology, we find developmental alignment for some classes of concepts (Euclidean Geometry, Geometrical Figures, Metric Properties, Topology) but not others (Chiral Figures, Geometric Transformations, Symmetrical Figures). For the case of number, we find developmental alignment in the emergence of a human-like ``mental number line'' representation with experience. These findings show the promise of computer vision models for understanding the development of mathematical understanding in humans.

With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations.

However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm.

However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

We adapt these arguments but for complex VAEs with a complex latent stage. We show that complex VAEs reveal to some level K\u00e4hler geometric structure. Our methods will be tailored for decoder geometry. We derive the Fisher information metric in the complex case under a latent complex Gaussian regularization with trivial relation matrix. It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric K\u00e4hler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a K\u00e4hler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying K\u00e4hler geometry.

However, the scarcity of fault data, due to the rarity of fault events and the high cost of data annotation, significantly hinders data-driven approaches. Existing time-series generation models, optimized for abundant normal data, struggle to capture fault distributions in few-shot scenarios, producing samples that lack authenticity and diversity due to the large domain gap and high intra-class variability of faults. To address this, we propose a novel few-shot fault time-series generation framework based on diffusion models. Our approach employs a positive-negative difference adapter, leveraging pre-trained normal data distributions to model the discrepancies between normal and fault domains for accurate fault synthesis.

However, vanilla MAR suffers from slow inference due to its hierarchical inference mechanism: an outer AR unmasking loop and an inner diffusion denoising chain. Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names. In conclusion, MARVAL demonstrates the first practical path to distillation and RL of masked auto-regressive diffusion models, enabling fast sampling and better preference alignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARVAL\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6269\u6563\u94fe\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfMAR\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u56e0\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7f13\u6162\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet 256*256\u4e0a\uff0cMARVAL-Huge\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862.00\u7684FID\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eMAR\u6269\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8630\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800cMARVAL-RL\u5728ImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9CLIP\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "MARVAL\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u88ab\u63a9\u76d6\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on unified emotion labels to supervise model training, often overlooking a critical challenge: inter-modal emotion conflicts, wherein different modalities within the same sample may express divergent emotional tendencies. In this work, we address this overlooked issue by proposing a novel framework, Typicality-based Consistent-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition (TiCAL), inspired by the stage-wise nature of human emotion perception. TiCAL dynamically assesses the consistency of each training sample by leveraging pseudo unimodal emotion labels alongside a typicality estimation. To further enhance emotion representation, we embed features in a hyperbolic space, enabling the capture of fine-grained distinctions among emotional categories. By incorporating consistency estimates into the learning process, our method improves model performance, particularly on samples exhibiting high modality inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, e.g, CMU-MOSEI and MER2023, validate the effectiveness of TiCAL in mitigating inter-modal emotional conflicts and enhancing overall recognition accuracy, e.g., with about 2.6% improvements over the state-of-the-art DMD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5178\u578b\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u6846\u67b6TiCAL\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5178\u578b\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u4f2a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u60c5\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u533a\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CMU-MOSEI\u548cMER2023\uff09\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cTiCAL\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684DMD\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea62.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "TiCAL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u66f2\u9762\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%.

Pioneer studies attempt to resolve this issue from a modality-agnostic perspective via key-value cache optimization or efficient sampling but most of them overlook modality-specific visual token redundancy. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on how visual token redundancy evolves with different dMLLM architectures and tasks and how visual token pruning affects dMLLM responses and efficiency. Specifically, our study reveals that visual redundancy emerges only in from-scratch dMLLMs while handling long-answer tasks. In addition, we validate that visual token pruning introduces non-negligible information loss in dMLLMs and only from-scratch dMLLMs can recover the lost information progressively during late denoising steps. Furthermore, our study shows that layer-skipping is promising for accelerating AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs, whereas progressive or late-step pruning is more effective for from-scratch dMLLMs. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on efficiency optimization for dMLLMs, greatly advancing their applicability across various multimodal understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9token\u5197\u4f59\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cddMLLM\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u5c42\u8df3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cdMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709dMLLM\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7531\u4e8e\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9token\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u526a\u679d\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cdMLLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9token\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u5bf9dMLLM\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5197\u4f59\u4ec5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7b54\u6848\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u624d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684dMLLM\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9token\u526a\u679d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684dMLLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u540e\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u6062\u590d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u8df3\u8fc7\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fAR\u5230\u6269\u6563\u7684dMLLM\uff0c\u800c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u7684dMLLM\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3adMLLMs\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Several studies have further improved the rendering quality of 3DGS, yet they still exhibit noticeable visual discrepancies when synthesizing views at sampling rates unseen during training. Specifically, they suffer from (i) erosion-induced blurring artifacts when zooming in and (ii) dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out. We speculate that these artifacts arise from the fundamental limitation of the alpha blending adopted in 3DGS methods. Instead of the conventional alpha blending that computes alpha and transmittance as scalar quantities over a pixel, we propose to replace it with our novel Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions. Thus, transmittances can be updated considering the spatial distribution of alpha values across the pixel area, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to the final rendering. Our Gaussian Blending maintains real-time rendering speed and requires no additional memory cost, while being easily integrated as a drop-in replacement into existing 3DGS-based or other NVS frameworks.

However, existing methods rely on frequent adaptation and high computational cost, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge environments. To address this, we propose SNAP, a sparse TTA framework that reduces adaptation frequency and data usage while preserving accuracy. SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates. Our method introduces two key components: (i) Class and Domain Representative Memory (CnDRM), which identifies and stores a small set of samples that are representative of both class and domain characteristics to support efficient adaptation with limited data; and (ii) Inference-only Batch-aware Memory Normalization (IoBMN), which dynamically adjusts normalization statistics at inference time by leveraging these representative samples, enabling efficient alignment to shifting target domains. Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%.

Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features.

However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts.

Each scene includes calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. We also provide baseline methods using a foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, as well as a comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations.

However, this continual learning paradigm faces the significant challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to performance degradation on previous ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel insight into catastrophic forgetting by conceptualizing it as a problem of missing gradients from old tasks during new task learning. Our approach approximates these missing gradients by leveraging the geometric properties of the parameter space, specifically using the directional vector between current parameters and previously optimal parameters as gradient guidance. This approximated gradient can be further integrated with real gradients from a limited replay buffer and regulated by a Bernoulli sampling strategy that dynamically balances model stability and plasticity.

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples.

Since a single past sequence can lead to multiple possible futures, a probabilistic HMP method predicts such multiple motions. While a single motion predicted by a deterministic method is evaluated only with the difference from its ground truth motion, multiple predicted motions should also be evaluated based on their distribution. For this evaluation, this paper focuses on the following two criteria. \\textbf{(a) Coverage}: motions should be distributed among multiple motion modes to cover diverse possibilities. \\textbf{(b) Validity}: motions should be kinematically valid as future motions observable from a given past motion. However, existing metrics simply appreciate widely distributed motions even if these motions are observed in a single mode and kinematically invalid. To resolve these disadvantages, this paper proposes a Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes (MMCM). For (a) coverage, MMCM divides a motion space into several clusters, each of which is regarded as a mode. These modes are used to explicitly evaluate whether predicted motions are distributed among multiple modes. For (b) validity, MMCM identifies valid modes by collecting possible future motions from a motion dataset. Our experiments validate that our clustering yields sensible mode definitions and that MMCM accurately scores multimodal predictions.

Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters.

To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm: instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS), which is designed to segment diverse lesion types based on simple, user-friendly instructions. Under this paradigm, we construct MIMIC-ILS, the first large-scale instruction-answer dataset for CXR lesion segmentation, using our fully automated multimodal pipeline that generates annotations from chest X-ray images and their corresponding reports. MIMIC-ILS contains 1.1M instruction-answer pairs derived from 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks, covering seven major lesion types. To empirically demonstrate its utility, we introduce ROSALIA, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MIMIC-ILS. ROSALIA can segment diverse lesions and provide textual explanations in response to user instructions.

Sohel Rahman"], "title": "BrainRotViT: Transformer-ResNet Hybrid for Explainable Modeling of Brain Aging from 3D sMRI", "comment": null, "summary": "Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $\u03c1=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5BrainRotViT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5deeCNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u8870\u8001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8111\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u8870\u8001\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u624b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53ca\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBrain ResNet\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\uff08BrainRotViT\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5deeCNN\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5148\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5207\u7247\u751f\u62102D\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7531\u6b8b\u5deeCNN\u56de\u5f52\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u6027\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8111\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e00\u79cdMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee3.34\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u57283.77\u52305.04\u5e74\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u969c\u788d\u548c\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8870\u8001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u7a81\u663e\u51fa\u4e0e\u8870\u8001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8111\u533a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8111\u9f84\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86CNN\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8870\u8001\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

This under-explored problem is currently split between practical \"blenders\" that lack generative fidelity and \"generators\" that require impractical, per-subject online finetuning. In this work, we introduce Insert In Style, the first zero-shot generative framework that is both practical and high-fidelity. Our core contribution is a unified framework with two key innovations: (i) a novel multi-stage training protocol that disentangles representations for identity, style, and composition, and (ii) a specialized masked-attention architecture that surgically enforces this disentanglement during generation. This approach prevents the concept interference common in general-purpose, unified-attention models. Our framework is trained on a new 100k sample dataset, curated from a novel data pipeline. This pipeline couples large-scale generation with a rigorous, two-stage filtering process to ensure both high-fidelity semantic identity and style coherence. Unlike prior work, our model is truly zero-shot and requires no text prompts. We also introduce a new public benchmark for stylized composition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods on both identity and style metrics, a result strongly corroborated by user studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Insert In Style\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u96f6-shot\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u63a9\u853d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d2\u5165\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u9886\u57df\u65f6\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u6548\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a9\u853d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002"}}

We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels.

To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

To address this, we propose Uni-Adapter, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs, improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aUni-Adapter\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c3D\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D VLFMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf93D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u30013D\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u56fe\u57fa\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u5185\u548c\u7c7b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002", "result": "Uni-Adapter\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5404\u79cd3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6e903D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ModelNet-40C 10.55%\uff0cScanObjectNN-C 8.26%\uff0cShapeNet-C 4.49%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Uni-Adapter\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e863D\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

The anisotropic diffusion of the input image is passed through three levels of the wavelet transform. The coefficients of different layers are adaptively thresholded and concatenated to produce the feature vector which is classified using the SVM classifier. Another contribution of the paper is to investigate the effect of various distortions such as pixel missing, block missing, and noise contamination.

While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput.

D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "D4C\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cDFQ\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5176\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\uff1a\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "D4C\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f4d\u5bbd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728CLIP ResNet-50\u548cViT-B/32\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "D4C\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u7684\u4f2a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Although numerous studies have focused on improving modality fusion strategies, most neglect fusion degradation, and none provide a theoretical analysis of its underlying causes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic theoretical investigation of fusion degradation in multimodal detection and identifies two key optimization deficiencies: (1) the gradients of unimodal branch backbones are severely suppressed under multimodal architectures, resulting in under-optimization of the unimodal branches; (2) disparities in modality quality cause weaker modalities to experience stronger gradient suppression, which in turn results in imbalanced modality learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method, which consists of two modules. The RSC module and the MD module are designed to respectively amplify the suppressed gradients and eliminate inter-modality coupling interference as well as modality imbalance, thereby enabling the comprehensive optimization of each modality-specific backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on the FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and MFAD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates fusion degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators.

However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets.

All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition.

Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class.

EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance.

To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens.

However, these approaches often result in incomplete activation of target regions, as a single textual description cannot fully capture the semantic diversity of complex categories. Moreover, they lack explicit cross-modal interaction and are vulnerable to noisy support features, further degrading visual prior quality. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Network (MTGNet), a dual-branch framework that enhances segmentation performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide the cross-modal optimization of visual priors. Specifically, we design a Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) module that suppresses interference and aggregates complementary semantic cues to enhance foreground activation and expand semantic coverage for structurally complex objects. We introduce a Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) module, which leverages multi-text embeddings as semantic anchors to facilitate the transfer of discriminative local prototypes from support images to query images, thereby improving semantic consistency and alleviating intra-class variations. Furthermore, a Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) module is presented to enhance visual prior robustness by leveraging internal self-similarity within support foreground features. It adaptively down-weights inconsistent regions and effectively suppresses interference in the query segmentation process. Extensive experiments on standard FSS benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MTGNet.

However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

To understand this failure and guide method design, we conduct a two-view representation analysis of ViTs. First, a layer-wise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of full feature matrices shows that final-layer representations are globally low-rank: for CaiT-S24, only $121/61/34/14$ dimensions suffice to capture $99\\%/95\\%/90\\%/80\\%$ of the energy. In principle, this suggests that a compact student plus a simple linear projector should be enough for feature alignment, contradicting the weak empirical performance of standard feature KD. To resolve this paradox, we introduce a token-level Spectral Energy Pattern (SEP) analysis that measures how each token uses channel capacity. SEP reveals that, despite the global low-rank structure, individual tokens distribute energy over most channels, forming a high-bandwidth encoding pattern. This results in an encoding mismatch between wide teachers and narrow students. Motivated by this insight, we propose two minimal, mismatch-driven strategies: (1) post-hoc feature lifting with a lightweight projector retained during inference, or (2) native width alignment that widens only the student's last block to the teacher's width. On ImageNet-1K, these strategies reactivate simple feature-map distillation in ViTs, raising DeiT-Tiny accuracy from $74.86\\%$ to $77.53\\%$ and $78.23\\%$ when distilling from CaiT-S24, while also improving standalone students trained without any teacher.

However, existing LiDAR place recognition methods often struggle to adapt to new environments without forgetting previously learned knowledge, a challenge widely known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose KDF+, a novel continual learning framework for LiDAR place recognition that extends the KDF paradigm with a loss-aware sampling strategy and a rehearsal enhancement mechanism. The proposed sampling strategy estimates the learning difficulty of each sample via its loss value and selects samples for replay according to their estimated difficulty. Harder samples, which tend to encode more discriminative information, are sampled with higher probability while maintaining distributional coverage across the dataset. In addition, the rehearsal enhancement mechanism encourages memory samples to be further refined during new-task training by slightly reducing their loss relative to previous tasks, thereby reinforcing long-term knowledge retention. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KDF+ consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art continual learning for LiDAR place recognition frameworks to yield significant and stable performance gains.

However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses on a wide front through a series of systematic improvements that together yield a significantly better model. In particular, we construct a novel matching architecture and loss, which, combined with a curated diverse training distribution, enables our model to solve many complex matching tasks. We further make training faster through a decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline, and at the same time, significantly reduce refinement memory usage through a custom CUDA kernel. Finally, we leverage the recent DINOv3 foundation model along with multiple other insights to make the model more robust and unbiased. In our extensive set of experiments we show that the resulting novel matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors.
