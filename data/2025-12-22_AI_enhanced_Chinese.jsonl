This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u7684LLM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7236\u6bcd\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\u4e09\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7fa4\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6df1\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u52a8\u673a\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5fc3\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u6211\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u7236\u6bcd\u3001\u6210\u4eba\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u90fd\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u83b7\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u6709\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c06\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u4e30\u5bcc\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning). These results position Atom as a practical, scalable approach for efficient video-language understanding on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training.

Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u6269\u5f20\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5224\u65ad\u5b9e\u4f53\u5143\u7ec4\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684'\u7ebf\u6027'\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684'\u5206\u7c7b'\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u56fe\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u9020\u6b64\u7c7b\u56fe\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6269\u5f20\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f53\u5143\u7ec4\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e\u56fe\u4e2d\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u9650\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u6269\u5f20\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u6784\u5efa\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6269\u5f20\u56fe\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u96c6\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency. Distilled PAACE-FT retains 97 percent of the teacher's performance while reducing inference cost by over an order of magnitude, enabling practical deployment of plan-aware compression with compact models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Struct-SQL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728Text-to-SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08+8.1%\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u53e5\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u9009\u62e9\uff1a\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u60f3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u5347SLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStruct-SQL\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3SLM\u6a21\u4eff\u5927\u578bLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u84b8\u998f\u7684SLM\u76f8\u6bd4\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316CoT\u57fa\u7ebf\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478.1%\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u53e5\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u84dd\u56fe\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347SLM\u751f\u6210SQL\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7Text-to-SQL\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210EEG\u548cEMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5047\u80a2\u81c2\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8fd0\u52a8", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u80a2\u5047\u80a2\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u5730\u533a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u53ca\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u622a\u80a2\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ec9\u4ef7\u4e14\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2\u91c7\u96c6EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0cMyoWare 2.0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u91c7\u96c6EMG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ESP32\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5904\u7406\u3002EEG\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7728\u773c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u90e8\u5f00\u5408\uff1bEMG\u91c7\u7528\u9608\u503c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e09\u6bb5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e26\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fde\u7eed\u516b\u5e27\u786e\u8ba4\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8098\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u539f\u578b\uff08\u603b\u6210\u672c\u7ea6240\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0cEEG\u63a7\u52364\u4e2a\u624b\u6307\u8235\u673a\uff0cEMG\u63a7\u52362\u4e2a\u8098\u90e8\u8235\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u751f\u7269\u76f4\u89c2\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u548c\u5168\u7403\u5065\u5eb7\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6539\u8fdb3D\u6253\u5370\u5916\u58f3\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8235\u673a\u626d\u77e9\u7b49"}}

We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.\n  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative.

Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community.

Virtual reality (VR) can present these practices and services in situated, interactive form, yet its role in service design for plastics recycling is still emerging. This paper examines how VR tools can contribute to designing plastics recycling services through two application cases that address different stages of the recycling journey. The first case, Clean Cabin Escape, is a household scale VR escape room where players collect and sort waste items into locally relevant categories, with immediate feedback that supports practice with plastics recycling decisions. The second case is a VR simulation of a plastics recycling center that represents a real planned site and is used in service design workshops where stakeholders explore layout, signage and customer paths for plastics fractions. Across the cases, we analyse how VR supported learning, engagement and shared sensemaking, and how it interacted with other service design methods such as workshops, customer path mapping and physical artefacts. The findings show that VR can make domestic sorting tasks and complex recycling centers more concrete for both citizens and professionals, but also highlight trade offs related to hardware access, onboarding effort, visual fidelity and localisation of recycling rules. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for integrating VR into broader service design toolsets for plastics recycling and circular economy services, and by pointing to directions for future research on long term impact and inclusive design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08VR\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5851\u6599\u56de\u6536\u670d\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u56de\u6536\u65c5\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86VR\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5171\u540c\u610f\u4e49\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5851\u6599\u56de\u6536\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u8df5\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0cVR\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u5851\u6599\u56de\u6536\u670d\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u521d\u7ea7\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76VR\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2aVR\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff1a1\uff09\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c4\u6a21VR\u5bc6\u5ba4\u9003\u8131\u6e38\u620f'Clean Cabin Escape'\uff0c\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u6309\u5f53\u5730\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5219\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5783\u573e\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u5373\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\uff1b2\uff09\u5851\u6599\u56de\u6536\u4e2d\u5fc3VR\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u4e2d\u4f9b\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u6807\u8bc6\u548c\u987e\u5ba2\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5206\u6790VR\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5171\u540c\u610f\u4e49\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0VR\u80fd\u4f7f\u5bb6\u5ead\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u590d\u6742\u56de\u6536\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5bf9\u516c\u6c11\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u66f4\u52a0\u5177\u4f53\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u4e0a\u624b\u96be\u5ea6\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u56de\u6536\u89c4\u5219\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u820d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u603b\u7ed3\u6307\u51fa\u5c06VR\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5851\u6599\u56de\u6536\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7ecf\u6d4e\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u670d\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u660e\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

We present SPECTRA, a watermarking approach that makes training data reliably detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of the training corpus. SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts.

We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study investigates how emotional alignment, semantic exploration, and linguistic innovation emerge within a collaborative storytelling paradigm that paired human participants with a large language model (LLM) in a turn-taking setup. Over nine days, more than 3,000 museum visitors contributed to 27 evolving narratives, co-authored with an LLM in a naturalistic, public installation. To isolate the dynamics specific to human involvement, we compared the resulting dataset with a simulated baseline where two LLMs completed the same task. Using sentiment analysis, semantic embeddings, and information-theoretic measures of novelty and resonance, we trace how humans and models co-construct stories over time. Our results reveal that affective alignment is primarily driven by the model, with limited mutual convergence in human-AI interaction. At the same time, human participants explored a broader semantic space and introduced more novel, narratively influential contributions. These patterns were significantly reduced in the simulated AI-AI condition. Together, these findings highlight the unique role of human input in shaping narrative direction and creative divergence in co-authored texts. The methods developed here provide a scalable framework for analysing dyadic interaction and offer a new lens on creativity, emotional dynamics, and semantic coordination in human-AI collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Evaluation and methodology study on dialogue topic segmentation", "summary": "Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.\n  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.\n  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4f20\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914dF1\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u6458\u8981\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u5339\u914d\u548cF1\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u7a97\u53e3\u5bb9\u5fcdF1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u8fb9\u754c\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6807\u6ce8\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u8d77\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u8bb8\u591a\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u7247\u6bb5\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u504f\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bdd\u9898\u5206\u5272\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u6b63\u786e\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fb9\u754c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms.

Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The project explored whether document-grounded language models could ethically and effectively augment human analysis of item performance while preserving the cultural and linguistic integrity of the Hawaiian language. Operating under the K\u0100'EO AI Policy Framework, the workflow used NotebookLM for cross-document synthesis of psychometric data and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for developer-facing interpretation, with human oversight at every stage. Fifty-eight flagged items across Hawaiian Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science were reviewed during Round 2 of the AI Lab, producing six interpretive briefs that identified systemic design issues such as linguistic ambiguity, Depth-of-Knowledge (DOK) misalignment, and structural overload. The findings demonstrate that AI can serve as an ethically bounded amplifier of human expertise, accelerating analysis while simultaneously prioritizing fairness, human expertise, and cultural authority.

Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case.

Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PILAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6AR\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u60c5\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e14\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3aAR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PILAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9eAR\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98df\u8c31\u63a8\u8350\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u65f6\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u98df\u8c31\u63a8\u8350\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u996e\u98df\u504f\u597d\u7684LLM\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc716\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLM\u89e3\u91ca\u754c\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u677f\u754c\u9762\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad840%\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u3001\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PILAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfXAI\u5728AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u76f4\u89c2\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making. It consistently surpasses baselines, and further analysis shows that it aligns local details with a coherent global representation, enabling more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling.

In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption.

Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own.

Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728AppWorld\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SAGE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sequential Rollout\u673a\u5236\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u76f8\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u53ef\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Skill-integrated Reward\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728AppWorld\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88.9%\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u4ea4\u4e92\u6b65\u9aa4\u51cf\u5c1126%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1159%\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6539\u8fdb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length.

This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$\u0394$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

While these tools are often evaluated in terms of technical performance, their successful and ethical use also depends on psychological factors such as trust, perceived risk, technology anxiety, and students general attitudes toward AI. This paper adopts a psychology oriented perspective to examine how university students form trust in AI based learning assistants. Drawing on recent literature in mental health, human AI interaction, and trust in automation, we propose a conceptual framework that organizes psychological predictors of trust into four groups: cognitive appraisals, affective reactions, social relational factors, and contextual moderators. A narrative review approach synthesizes empirical findings and derives research questions and hypotheses for future studies.

However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process.

Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities.

However, identifying and interpreting injury prone events from raw video remains difficult and time-consuming. We present VAIR, a visual analytics system that supports injury risk analysis using 3D human motion reconstructed from sports video. VAIR combines pose estimation, bio-mechanical simulation, and synchronized visualizations to help users explore how joint-level risk indicators evolve over time.

To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models.

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best.

Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III.

Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b21\u6570", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5217\u63a7\u5236\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4MPC\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u65f6\u57df\u52a8\u4f5c\u961f\u5217\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4fee\u6b63\u5668\u6216\u56de\u9000\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u89c4\u5212", "result": "\u5728DMC Humanoid-Walk\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u6b21\u6570\u4ece500\u964d\u81f3282\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e25%\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d7.1%", "conclusion": "\u63a8\u6d4b\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u63a8\u7406\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Given their ongoing cognitive and emotional development, children are especially vulnerable and depend on designs that safeguard their well-being. When apps feature manipulative interfaces or heavy advertising, they may exert undue influence on young users, contributing to prolonged screen time, disrupted self-regulation, and accidental in-app purchases. In this study, we examined 20 popular, free-to-download children's apps in German-speaking regions to assess the prevalence of deceptive design patterns and advertising. Despite platform policies and EU frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation and the Digital Services Act, every app contained interface manipulations intended to nudge, confuse, or pressure young users, averaging nearly six distinct deceptive patterns per app. Most also displayed high volumes of non-skippable ads, frequently embedded within core gameplay.

To appear in Hudl Performance Insights 2025", "summary": "Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Adaptive systems are essential, dynamically matching difficulty to user ability to maintain engagement and accelerate learning. Current adaptive systems often rely on simple performance heuristics or predict visual complexity and affect instead of cognitive load. This study presents the first implementation of real-time adaptive cognitive load control in Virtual Reality cognitive training based on eye-tracking and physiological data. We developed a bidirectional LSTM model with a self-attention mechanism, trained on eye-tracking and physiological (PPG, GSR) data from 74 participants. We deployed it in real-time with 54 participants across single-task (sustained attention) and dual-task (sustained attention + mental arithmetic) paradigms. Difficulty was adjusted dynamically based on participant self-assessment or model's real-time cognitive load predictions. Participants showed a tendency to estimate the task as too difficult, even though they were objectively performing at their best. Over the course of a 10-minute session, both adaptation methods converged at equivalent difficulty in single-task scenarios, with no significant differences in subjective workload or game performance. However, in the dual-task conditions, the model successfully pushed users to higher difficulty levels without performance penalties or increased frustration, highlighting a user tendency to underestimate capacity under high cognitive load. Findings indicate that machine learning models may provide more objective cognitive capacity assessments than self-directed approaches, mitigating subjective performance biases and enabling more effective training by pushing users beyond subjective comfort zones toward physiologically-determined optimal challenge levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples.

In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning.

To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources.

One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of \"concept\" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents \"concepts\" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ece\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u5b9a\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\uff1a\u6982\u5ff5\u662f\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u6784\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6982\u5ff5\u8131\u79bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22AI\u80fd\u5426\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u5df2\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u6d41\u52a8\u7684\uff08\u8fb9\u754c\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u5408\u5e76\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bcd\u5178\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u53ef\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u53ef\u5728\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e0e\u4e3b\u4f53\u603b\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u4e00\u7ec4\u90e8\u5206\u6784\u6210\u53ef\u9006\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5373\u4efb\u4e00\u7f3a\u5931\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u4ece\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u8003\u8651Kolmogorov\u5f0f\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u677e\u5f1b\u91cf\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62'\u6982\u5ff5'\u8131\u79bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u91cf\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u63cf\u8ff0\u90e8\u5206\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\uff1a\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u5757\u51fa\u73b0\uff08\u6216\u4ea7\u751f\u4e89\u8bae\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u6982\u5ff5\u4f1a\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6269\u5f20\u3001\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u5206\u88c2\u4e0e\u5408\u5e76\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9632\u6b62\u6982\u5ff5\u8131\u79bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5b58\u5728\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8fc7\u91cf\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u62c6\u5206\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840/\u79cd\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u901a\u8baf\u6210\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u6bd4\u7279\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAI\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8fa9\u8bc1\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u652f\u6301\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5171\u4eab\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u534f\u8bae\u3002"}}

To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \\emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \\emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization.

However, these systems can fail in opaque ways, making it difficult for users to observe, understand, and correct errors. We conducted formative interviews with 12 practitioners to identify mismatches between existing observability tools and users' needs. Based on these insights, we designed XAgen, an explainability tool that supports users with varying AI expertise through three core capabilities: log visualization for glanceable workflow understanding, human-in-the-loop feedback to capture expert judgment, and automatic error detection via an LLM-as-a-judge. In a user study with 8 participants, XAgen helped users more easily locate failures, attribute to specific agents or steps, and iteratively improve configurations.

In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels.

This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u4ece\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u5b58\u5728\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u9886\u57df\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5b9a\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6982\u7387\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u5b9eRashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\uff1b2. \u7531Rashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b3. \u4eceRashomon\u96c6\u5408\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u5bbd\u677e\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Rashomon\u6548\u5e94\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u540c\u6837\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6df1\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u2014\u2014\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bbd\u677e\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction.

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling.

Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53ef\u4fe1\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210BERT\u3001RoBERTa\u3001DistilBERT\u3001DeBERTa\u3001ELECTRA\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u5c0fTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u4f4e\u6536\u655b\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u8bef\u5dee\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u9a8c\u8bc1F1\uff09\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728DAIR-AI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f9793.5%\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eFalcon\u3001Mistral\u3001Qwen\u3001Phi\u7b49\u5927\u578bLLM\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7LoRA\u9002\u914d\uff09\uff1b\u4ec5595M\u603b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6bd47B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u7279\u5b9aNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%.

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "LGCLIP\u662f\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u6846\u67b6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u53cc\u5854\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u51c6\u5907\u96be\u5ea6", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LGCLIP\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u56fe\u6587\u6807\u6ce8\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5206\u7c7b\u8303\u5f0f"}}

While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u65f6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\uff08TRM\uff09\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u4ee5\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173RL\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTRM\u6269\u5c55\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u5b57\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173RL\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u62bd\u8c61\u5c06TRM\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5229\u7528TRM\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6d41\u884cRL\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u65e2\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u53c8\u6ee1\u8db3TRM\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540cTRM\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7a81\u663e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "TRM\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611fRL\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems.

This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation.

In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most.

To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer.

To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs.

This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a \"good\" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level.

Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items.

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments.

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u89e3\u8026SFT\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\"\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5ef6\u4f38\u9010\u6e10\u4e27\u5931\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u8fc7\u65e9\u5730\u7ea0\u7f20\u4e86\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6218\u7565\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e24\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u89e3\u8026SFT\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8303\u5f0f\u5c06\u5176\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\uff1b2)\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u548c\u6218\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u3001\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6301\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8ba4\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5728GitHub\u4e0a\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.", "AI": {"tldr": "MINPO\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u4f2a\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u7531\u79ef\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u590d\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff08\u79ef\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5377\u79ef\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u968f\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u611f\u77e5\u795e\u7ecf\u4f2a\u7b97\u5b50\uff08MINPO\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528KAN\u6216MLP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u9006\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u9879\u4fdd\u969c\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u6355\u83b7\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u5404\u79cdIDE\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u7c7b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6570\u9636PDE\uff09\u7edf\u6cbb\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u6280\u672f\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eMLP\u7684A-PINN/fPINN\u53ca\u5176\u65b0\u5f00\u53d1\u7684KAN\u53d8\u4f53A-PIKAN/fPIKAN\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMINPO\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6838\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u590d\u6838\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "MINPO\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7279\u5b9a\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d7\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u7b97\u5b50\u652f\u914d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments.

Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance. These results demonstrate that AnyCXR establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for anatomy-aware CXR analysis and offers a practical pathway toward reducing annotation burdens while improving robustness across diverse imaging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnyCXR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u8de8\u4efb\u610f\u6295\u7167\u89d2\u5ea6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u8054\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u621054\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u5168\u9762\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u91c7\u96c6\u6761\u4ef6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u7167\u89d2\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5f15\u64ce\u4ece3D CT\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e07\u5f20\u89e3\u5256\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5408\u6210X\u5149\u7247\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u8054\u5408\u6807\u6ce8\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6807\u6ce8\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AnyCXR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u527254\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u540e\u524d\u4f4d\u3001\u4fa7\u4f4d\u3001\u659c\u4f4d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5fc3\u80f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u810a\u67f1\u66f2\u7387\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "AnyCXR\u4e3a\u89e3\u5256\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u8d1f\u62c5\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60(ICL)\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3001\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u56fe\u5f0f\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u5f0f\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5f0f\u6216\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u6790\u3002\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u9a8c\u8bc1ICL\u662f\u5426\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u9002\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57289\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6765\u81ea7\u4e2aTransformer\u5bb6\u65cf\u548cMamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf370M-13B\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u89e3\u8026\u3001\u5148\u9a8c-\u56fe\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0", "result": "1.\u53cc\u91cd\u89e3\u8026\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u671fMLP\u4fee\u8865100%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u4fee\u886562%\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\n2.\u5148\u9a8c-\u56fe\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u56fe\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\n3.\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff1a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975eTransformer\u7684Mamba\uff09\u4e2d\u90fd\u6709\u6548\n\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u8bef\u8def\u7531\uff0872.7%\u8fd1\u56e0\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u662f\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bef\u8def\u7531\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u5e72\u6270\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8fd9\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4efb\u610f\u6620\u5c04\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u800c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8986\u76d6\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u5b9e\u7528\u610f\u4e49\uff1a\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8ICL\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027"}}

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdvJudge-Zero\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff1a\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u591f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e8c\u5143\u5224\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548cLLM-as-a-Judge\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d77\u7740\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e14\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u5224\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdvJudge-Zero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u641c\u7d22\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u5934\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\u53cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9'\u8f6f\u6a21\u5f0f'\u4e2d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5927\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6781\u9ad8\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bef\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLMIR\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff08\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f4e/\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u964d\u7ea7\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VLMIR\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content.

To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08EMAG\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\uff08HPS\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7c92\u5ea6\u6216\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u56fa\u5b9a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u7ec6\u9000\u5316\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6307\u6570\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u5747\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08EMAG\uff09\uff1a\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u4e0eAPG\u3001CADS\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eCFG\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cEMAG\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\uff08HPS\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u4e86+0.46\uff0c\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u7ec6\u5fae\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EMAG\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002"}}

Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDRIM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff1b2\uff09\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff1b3\uff09RL\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u5197\u4f59\u60e9\u7f5a\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6fc0\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eDRIM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "DRIM\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b"}}

We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems.

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeDance\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u94fe\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u5355\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u94fe\u3001\u56fa\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u5355\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982o3\uff09\u5df2\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u201c\u5e26\u56fe\u50cf\u601d\u8003\u201d\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CodeDance\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u8f85\u52a9\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u6846\u3001\u7ebf\u6761\u3001\u56fe\u8868\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5e73\u8861\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5de5\u5177\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCodeDance\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u4e2d\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fd8\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GPT-4o\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u5c01\u95ed\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65b0\u5174\u884c\u4e3a\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeDance\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u81ea\u68c0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ADK\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3aVLMs\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e9b\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u5206\u7c7b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u96be\u4ee5\u627f\u53d7\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f85\u52a9\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08ADK\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u90e8\u7f72\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u793a\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002ADK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cADK\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cdPEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ADK\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To approximate \"never-before-seen\" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE.

Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.", "AI": {"tldr": "EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc712\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u6d4b\u8bd55\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u751a\u81f3\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acbEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf95\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6(\u5305\u62ec\u95f4\u63a5\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u6027\u522b\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u7b49)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e8612\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf95\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u57285\u4e2a\u9886\u57df(\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001NSFW\u3001\u7248\u6743)\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u4f1a\u751f\u6210\u672c\u5e94\u88ab\u64e6\u9664\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u800c\u653e\u5927\u4e86\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u80fd\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations. These findings establish inter-layer collaboration as a fundamental enhancement to Forward-Forward learning, with immediate applicability to neuromorphic computing architectures and energy-constrained AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFF\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c42\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5404\u5c42\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316goodness\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u534f\u8c03\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6df1\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u534f\u4f5c\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CFF\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u534f\u4f5c\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9aCFF\uff08F-CFF\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u5c42\u95f4\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94CFF\uff08A-CFF\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u4f5c\u53c2\u6570", "result": "\u5728MNIST\u548cFashion-MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u95f4\u534f\u4f5c\u662f\u524d\u5411-\u524d\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u53d7\u9650AI\u7cfb\u7edf"}}

In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \\emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6602\u8d35\u5168\u5c40\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u65f6\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u5904\u8d77\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u800c\u975e\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u9500", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u9ed1\u76d2\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u9009\u62e9\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd"}}

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DESSERT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0b\u4e00\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u626d\u66f2\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u5e27\uff0c\u4f46\u50cf\u7d20\u4f4d\u79fb\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898", "method": "1) \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Stable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1aER-VAE\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e27\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u566a\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6837\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u589e\u5f3a(DLT)\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "DESSERT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5355\u8fb9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DESSERT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency.

The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRPL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6539\u5584\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u9650\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6fc0\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22\u5371\u53ca\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6839\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728Waymo\u548cNuPlan\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30SRPL\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u914d\u5907\u672a\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "SRPL\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5956\u52b1-\u5b89\u5168\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08\u6548\u5e94\u91cfr=0.65-0.86\uff09\u548c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff08\u6548\u5e94\u91cfr=0.70-0.83\uff09\u5747\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u62fc\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5404\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\uff08stitching layers\uff09\u6765\u878d\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5374\u964d\u4f4e\u5404\u65b9\u81ea\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u800c\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u5404\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u7ade\u4e89\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u62fc\u63a5\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process.

In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models.

Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image.

While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE. This work provides new insights into designing hybrid training strategies to enhance the performance and robustness of PINNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first.

However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\\textbf{T}rust-\\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility.

Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS.

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance.

In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs.

Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength.

Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval.

ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9aMLLMs\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5173\u8054\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b1005\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u7684GroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u89c6\u6027\u548c\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f3025\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MLLMs\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8fbe\u523045.1%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u7edd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0%\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53472.9%\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u62d2\u7edd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f327.9%", "conclusion": "GroundingME\u65e2\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe"}}

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.\n  Funding: SciLifeLab and Wallenberg Data Driven Life Science Program, Instrumentarium Science Foundation, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "RRFF-FEM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u5efa\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7t\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7ef4t\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u5206\u6790\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u7279\u5f81\u6570N\u221dmlogm\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u6001\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u79cdPDE\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u663e\u793aRRFF-FEM\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u77ed\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "RRFF-FEM\u4e3a\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6PDE\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse.

To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bLLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cLlama 3.2 Vision-8B-2\u5728PGD\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Llama 3.2 Vision\u5728VQA\u57fa\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7406\u89e3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u672a\u89c1\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5e72\u6270\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684PGD\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u975e\u5b9a\u5411\uff09\uff0c\u5728VQA v2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9LLaVA-1.5-13B\u548cLlama 3.2 Vision-8B-2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u7528\u6807\u51c6VQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u91cf\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u653b\u51fb\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "Llama 3.2 Vision\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f83\u9ad8\u6270\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff08\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eLLaVA\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662fMeta\u7684Llama 3.2 Vision\u7b49\u5f53\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions.

They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.\n  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.\n  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs).

While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem.

These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research.

To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios.

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.\n  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.\n  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UrbanDIFF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u57ce\u533a\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u5f71\u50cf\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u4e91\u9699\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe85%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u91cd\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6216\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8fde\u7eed\u4e91\u9699\u533a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u5feb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u5305\u62ec\u5efa\u6210\u533a\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f3a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e91\u9699\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u533a\u7684MODIS Terra LST\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u752820%-85%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5408\u6210\u4e91\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eUrbanDIFF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u572885%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u65f6SSIM\u4e3a0.89\u3001RMSE\u4e3a1.2K\u3001R2\u4e3a0.84\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u6162\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanDIFF\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e91\u6c61\u67d3\u57ce\u5e02\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u5f71\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning.

At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic.

In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency.

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u826f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9690\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4VAE\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u4f18\u5316\uff1b\u4e3a\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u5927\u969c\u788d\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u5c11\u7d27\u51d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u79bb\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u51c6\u786e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u538b\u7f29\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0896\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u683716x16\uff09\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff08T2I\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728T2I\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u8bc6\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u7efc\u5408\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u7406\u89e3\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}
