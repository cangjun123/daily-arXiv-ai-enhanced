This paper reveals the irrationality of indiscriminate inclusion of all models on agents for joint prediction, highlighting the imperative to prioritize quality over quantity in cooperative learning. Specifically, we present the first selective online learning framework for distributed Gaussian process (GP) regression, namely distributed error-informed GP (EIGP), that enables each agent to assess its neighboring collaborators, using the proposed selection function to choose the higher quality GP models with less prediction errors. Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology, showcasing its superiority over the state-of-the-art distributed GP methods with different benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Pattern exploration seeks to clarify the mechanisms behind the emergence of system complexity, while theoretical explanations aim to identify the fundamental causes of this complexity. Laws are generally defined as mappings between variables, whereas theories offer causal explanations of system behavior. Agent Based Modeling(ABM) is an important approach for studying complex systems, but it tends to emphasize simulation over experimentation. As a result, ABM often struggles to deeply uncover the governing operational principles. Unlike conventional scenario analysis that relies on human reasoning, computational experiments emphasize counterfactual experiments-that is, creating parallel worlds that simulate alternative \"evolutionary paths\" of real-world events. By systematically adjusting input variables and observing the resulting changes in output variables, computational experiments provide a robust tool for causal inference, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional ABM. Together, these methods offer causal insights into the dynamic evolution of systems. This part can help readers gain a preliminary understanding of the entire computational experiment method, laying the foundation for the subsequent study.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u91cd\u6a21\u62df\u8f7b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\uff08ABM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u504f\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u5728\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5e73\u884c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4f20\u7edfABM\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u7acb\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfABM\u80fd\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0eABM\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

Existing document AI systems remain limited by OCR errors, long-document fragmentation, constrained throughput, and insufficient auditability for high-stakes synthesis. We present a schema-constrained AI extraction system that transforms full-text biomedical PDFs into structured, analysis-ready records by explicitly restricting model inference through typed schemas, controlled vocabularies, and evidence-gated decisions. Documents are ingested using resume-aware hashing, partitioned into caption-aware page-level chunks, and processed asynchronously under explicit concurrency controls. Chunk-level outputs are deterministically merged into study-level records using conflict-aware consolidation, set-based aggregation, and sentence-level provenance to support traceability and post-hoc audit. Evaluated on a corpus of studies on direct oral anticoagulant level measurement, the pipeline processed all documents without manual intervention, maintained stable throughput under service constraints, and exhibited strong internal consistency across document chunks. Iterative schema refinement substantially improved extraction fidelity for synthesis-critical variables, including assay classification, outcome definitions, follow-up duration, and timing of measurement. These results demonstrate that schema-constrained, provenance-aware extraction enables scalable and auditable transformation of heterogeneous scientific PDFs into structured evidence, aligning modern document AI with the transparency and reliability requirements of biomedical evidence synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This requirement imposes strict constraints on the design of any ontology intended to function as a shared substrate.

Any ontology that asserts causal or deontic conclusions as ontological facts cannot serve as a neutral substrate across divergent frameworks without revision or contradiction. It follows that neutral ontological substrates must be pre-causal and pre-normative, representing entities, together with identity and persistence conditions, while externalizing interpretation, evaluation, and explanation.

However, little is known about the characteristics of these GenAI-based chatbots and their user interactions.

Findings identify four chatbot types: roleplay characters, story generators, image generators, and do-anything-now bots. AI Characters portraying fantasy personas and enabling hangout-style interactions are most common, often using explicit avatar images to invite engagement.

Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time.

An open-source microsimulation is used to project Ireland's population into the future where each individual is defined by a number of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. The model is disaggregated spatially at the Electoral Division level, allowing for analysis of results at that, or any broader geographical scales. Ordinal regression is utilised to predict an individual's self-rated health based on their socio-economic characteristics and this method is shown to match well to Ireland's 2022 distribution of health statuses. Due to differences in the health status distributions of the health microdata and the national data, an alignment technique is proposed to bring predictions closer to real values. It is illustrated for one potential future population that the effects of an ageing population may outweigh other improvements in socio-economic outcomes to disimprove Ireland's mean self-rated health slightly. Health modelling at this kind of granular scale could offer local authorities a chance to predict and combat health issues which may arise in their local populations in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current safety evaluations in this field are mostly limited to detecting whether LLMs output prohibited words in single-turn conversations, neglecting the gradual erosion of safety boundaries in long dialogues. Examples include making definitive guarantees, assuming responsibility, and playing professional roles. We believe that with the evolution of mainstream LLMs, words with obvious safety risks are easily filtered by their underlying systems, while the real danger lies in the gradual transgression of boundaries during multi-turn interactions, driven by the LLM's attempts at comfort and empathy.\n  This paper proposes a multi-turn stress testing framework and conducts long-dialogue safety tests on three cutting-edge LLMs using two pressure methods: static progression and adaptive probing. We generated 50 virtual patient profiles and stress-tested each model through up to 20 rounds of virtual psychiatric dialogues. The experimental results show that violations are common, and both pressure modes produced similar violation rates. However, adaptive probing significantly advanced the time at which models crossed boundaries, reducing the average number of turns from 9.21 in static progression to 4.64. Under both mechanisms, making definitive or zero-risk promises was the primary way in which boundaries were breached. These findings suggest that the robustness of LLM safety boundaries cannot be inferred solely through single-turn tests; it is necessary to fully consider the wear and tear on safety boundaries caused by different interaction pressures and characteristics in extended dialogues.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale.

This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference. This research offers a novel, prompt-driven paradigm for intelligent and reliable power grid drawing review.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work derived a definition of \"spiritual support\" through co-design workshops with stakeholders in online health communities. This paper contributes: (1) a revision of that definition through member checking with professional spiritual care providers (SCPs); (2) a novel design framework -- SPIRIT -- which can help to expand models of delivery for spiritual care using digital technologies. Through re-analysis of previous data and new interviews with SCPs, we identify three prerequisites for meaningful spiritual care: openness to care, safe space, and the ability to discern and articulate spiritual needs. We also propose six design dimensions: loving presence, meaning-making, appropriate degree of technology use, location, degree of relational closeness, and temporality. We discuss how SPIRIT offers guidance for designing impactful digital spiritual care intervention systems within and beyond clinical settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

We identified four key hallucination types in MCQ generation: reasoning inconsistencies, insolvability, factual errors, and mathematical errors. To address this, we propose a hallucination-free multi-agent generation framework that breaks down MCQ generation into discrete, verifiable stages. Our framework utilizes both rule-based and LLM-based detection agents, as well as hallucination scoring metrics to optimize question quality. We redefined MCQ generation as an optimization task minimizing hallucination risk while maximizing validity, answerability, and cost-efficiency. We also introduce an agent-led refinement process that uses counterfactual reasoning and chain-of-thought (CoT) to iteratively improve hallucination in question generation. We evaluated a sample of AP- aligned STEM questions, where our system reduced hallucination rates by over 90% compared to baseline generation while preserving the educational value and style of questions.

However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification.

However, as visual complexity increases, perceptual performance declines, making it more difficult to detect changes quickly and accurately. This study examines how visual features, known for facilitating preattentive processing, impact a change detection task in immersive 3D environments, with a focus on visual complexity, object attributes, and spatial proximity. Our results demonstrate that preattentive processing enhances change detection, particularly when the altered object is spatially isolated and not perceptually grouped with similar surrounding objects. Changes to isolated objects were detected more reliably, suggesting that perceptual isolation reduces cognitive load and draws more attention. Conversely, when a changed object was surrounded by visually similar elements, participants were less likely to detect the change, indicating that perceptual grouping hinders individual object recognition in complex scenes. These results provide guidelines for designing VR applications that strategically utilize spatial isolation and visual features to improve the user experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u7a7a\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7ec4\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u524d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u88ab\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b64\u7acb\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5468\u56f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7ec4\u65f6\uff1b\u800c\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7ec4\u5219\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9610\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u524d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316VR\u5e94\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u524d\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u88ab\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5b64\u7acb\u4e14\u672a\u88ab\u5468\u56f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u7ec4\u65f6\u3002\u5b64\u7acb\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u9694\u79bb\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u5f53\u88ab\u6539\u53d8\u5bf9\u8c61\u88ab\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u5143\u7d20\u5305\u56f4\u65f6\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7ec4\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1VR\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\uff1a\u53ef\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u9694\u79bb\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b64\u7acb\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, GS models require storing millions of parameters, leading to large file sizes that impair their use in practical multimedia systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GS Image-based Compression (GSICO), a novel GS codec that efficiently compresses pre-trained GS models while preserving perceptual fidelity. The core contribution lies in a mapping procedure that arranges GS parameters into structured images, guided by a novel algorithm that enhances spatial coherence. These GS parameter images are then encoded using a conventional image codec. Experimental evaluations on Tanks and Temples, Deep Blending, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets show that GSICO achieves average compression factors of 20.2x with minimal loss in visual quality, as measured by PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Compared with state-of-the-art GS compression methods, the proposed codec consistently yields superior rate-distortion (RD) trade-offs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Trees can be used to represent RNA secondary structures, which directly relate to the function of non-coding RNAs. Recent developments in sequencing technology and artificial intelligence have yielded numerous biological data that can be represented with tree structures. This requires novel methods for tree structure data analytics. Tree polynomials provide a computationally efficient, interpretable and comprehensive way to encode tree structures as matrices, which are compatible with most data analytics tools. Machine learning methods based on the Canberra distance between tree polynomials have been introduced to analyze phylogenies and nucleic acid structures.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, optimizing SCs remains challenging, particularly in partner selection, a key bottleneck shaped by competitive and cooperative dynamics. This challenge constitutes a multi-objective dynamic game requiring a synergistic integration of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making and Game Theory. Traditional approaches, grounded in mathematical simplifications and managerial heuristics, fail to capture real-world intricacies and risk introducing subjective biases. Multi-agent simulation offers promise, but prior research has largely relied on fixed, uniform agent logic, limiting practical applicability. Recent advances in LLMs create opportunities to represent complex SC requirements and hybrid game logic. However, challenges persist in modeling dynamic SC relationships, ensuring interpretability, and balancing agent autonomy with expert control. We present SCSimulator, a visual analytics framework that integrates LLM-driven MAS with human-in-the-loop collaboration for SC partner selection. It simulates SC evolution via adaptive network structures and enterprise behaviors, which are visualized via interpretable interfaces. By combining CoT reasoning with XAI techniques, it generates multi-faceted, transparent explanations of decision trade-offs. Users can iteratively adjust simulation settings to explore outcomes aligned with their expectations and strategic priorities. Developed through iterative co-design with SC experts and industry managers, SCSimulator serves as a proof-of-concept, offering methodological contributions and practical insights for future research on SC decision-making and interactive AI-driven analytics.

Redirected Walking (RDW) techniques mitigate this by subtly manipulating the virtual camera to guide users away from physical collisions within pre-defined VEs. However, RDW efficacy diminishes significantly when substantial geometric divergence exists between the physical and virtual environments, leading to unavoidable collisions. Existing scene generation methods primarily focus on object relationships or layout aesthetics, often neglecting the crucial aspect of physical compatibility required for effective RDW. To address this, we introduce HCVR (High Compatibility Virtual Reality Environment Generation), a novel framework that generates virtual scenes inherently optimized for alignment-based RDW controllers. HCVR first employs ENI++, a novel, boundary-sensitive metric to evaluate the incompatibility between physical and virtual spaces by comparing rotation-sensitive visibility polygons. Guided by the ENI++ compatibility map and user prompts, HCVR utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware 3D asset retrieval and initial layout generation. The framework then strategically adjusts object selection, scaling, and placement to maximize coverage of virtually incompatible regions, effectively guiding users towards RDW-feasible paths. User studies evaluating physical collisions and layout quality demonstrate HCVR's effectiveness with HCVR-generated scenes, resulting in 22.78 times fewer physical collisions and received 35.89\\% less on ENI++ score compared to LLM-based generation with RDW, while also receiving 12.5\\% higher scores on user feedback to layout design.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCVR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ENI++\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u7136\u884c\u8d70\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u7684\u6c89\u6d78\u611f\uff0c\u4f46\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5927\u578b\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u51e0\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u5bf9\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528ENI++\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u4e0e\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u56fe\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5e03\u5c40\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u7269\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u653e\u7f6e\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8986\u76d6\u865a\u62df\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cHCVR\u751f\u6210\u7684\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8622.78\u500d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\uff0cENI++\u5206\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8635.89%\uff0c\u5728\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u51fa12.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "HCVR\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u884c\u8d70\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u865a\u62df\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing paradigms typically follow a two-stage process: computationally expensive memory construction (e.g., structuring data into graphs) followed by naive retrieval-augmented generation. However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization. CoM introduces a Chain-of-Memory mechanism that organizes retrieved fragments into coherent inference paths through dynamic evolution, utilizing adaptive truncation to prune irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on the LongMemEval and LoCoMo benchmarks demonstrate that CoM outperforms strong baselines with accuracy gains of 7.5%-10.4%, while drastically reducing computational overhead to approximately 2.7% of token consumption and 6.0% of latency compared to complex memory architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoM\uff08Chain-of-Memory\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7b80\u5355\u62fc\u63a5\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5916\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6784\u5efa\uff08\u5982\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u6784\u9020\u6210\u56fe\uff09\u52a0\u4e0a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u590d\u6742\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u62fc\u63a5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u68c0\u7d22\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCoM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u5411\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u5f15\u5165Chain-of-Memory\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u622a\u65ad\u6765\u526a\u88c1\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728LongMemEval\u548cLoCoMo\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCoM\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477.5%-10.4%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7ea62.7%\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u548c6.0%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "CoM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions.

Low-quality labels may hamper performance and make the model training less robust. To address this issue, we propose SegAE (Segmentation Assessment Engine), a lightweight vision-language model (VLM) that automatically predicts label quality across 142 anatomical structures. Trained on over four million image-label pairs with quality scores, SegAE achieves a high correlation coefficient of 0.902 with ground-truth Dice similarity and evaluates a 3D mask in 0.06s. SegAE shows several practical benefits: (I) Our analysis reveals widespread low-quality labeling across public datasets; (II) SegAE improves data efficiency and training performance in active and semi-supervised learning, reducing dataset annotation cost by one-third and quality-checking time by 70% per label. This tool provides a simple and effective solution for quality control in large-scale medical segmentation datasets.

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks. Notably, it also successfully circumvents Blacklight, a SOTA stateful defense, resulting in a $0\\%$ detection rate.

This emerging paradigm provides a powerful testbed for studying social dynamics and strategic behaviors among intelligent agents. However, current research remains fragmented and lacks a unifying theoretical foundation. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive survey of LLM-based multi-agent systems through a game-theoretic lens.

We uncover a surprising capability in AR audio generators: their early prefix tokens implicitly encode global semantic attributes of the final output, such as event count and sound-object category, revealing a form of implicit planning. Building on this insight, we propose Plan-Critic, a lightweight auxiliary model trained with a Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)-inspired objective to predict final instruction-following quality from partial generations. At inference time, Plan-Critic enables guided exploration: it evaluates candidate prefixes early, prunes low-fidelity trajectories, and reallocates computation to high-potential planning seeds. Our Plan-Critic-guided sampling achieves up to a 10-point improvement in CLAP score over the AR baseline-establishing a new state of the art in AR text-to-audio generation-while maintaining computational parity with standard best-of-N decoding.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility. The system combines elite trajectory pooling, multi-island parallel exploration, and containerized execution to balance exploration and exploitation across heterogeneous hardware. We evaluate PhyloEvolve on scientific computing workloads including PDE solvers, manifold learning, and spectral graph algorithms, demonstrating consistent improvements in runtime, memory efficiency, and correctness over baseline and evolutionary methods.

This paper presents a novel framework that transforms a single frontal-view camera image into a concise natural language description, effectively capturing spatial layouts, semantic relationships, and driving-relevant cues. The proposed model leverages a hybrid attention mechanism to enhance spatial and semantic feature extraction and integrates these features to generate contextually rich and detailed scene descriptions. To address the limited availability of specialized datasets in this domain, a new dataset derived from the BDD100K dataset has been developed, with comprehensive guidelines provided for its construction. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth discussion of relevant evaluation metrics, identifying the most appropriate measures for this task. Extensive quantitative evaluations using metrics such as CIDEr and SPICE, complemented by human judgment assessments, demonstrate that the proposed model achieves strong performance and effectively fulfills its intended objectives on the newly developed dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u6c7d\u8f66\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5355\u4e00\u524d\u89c6\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8f83\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u9a7e\u9a76\u76f8\u5173\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5355\u5f20\u524d\u89c6\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u7ec6\u8282\u8be6\u5b9e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u57fa\u4e8eBDD100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6307\u5357\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6700\u9002\u5408\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528CIDEr\u548cSPICE\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5355\u5f20\u6c7d\u8f66\u524d\u89c6\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u65b0\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These apps commonly support engagement through goals, reminders, and structured targets, which can reinforce comparison, judgment, and performance anxiety. To explore a complementary approach that prioritizes self-reflection, we design KRIYA, an AI wellbeing companion that supports co-interpretive engagement with personal wellbeing data. KRIYA aims to collaborate with users to explore questions, explanations, and future scenarios through features such as Comfort Zone, Detective Mode, and What-If Planning. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 college students interacting with a KRIYA prototype using hypothetical data. Our findings show that through KRIYA interaction, users framed engaging with wellbeing data as interpretation rather than performance, experienced reflection as supportive or pressuring depending on emotional framing, and developed trust through transparency.

This work introduces a Layer-Adaptive Expert Pruning (LAEP) algorithm designed for the pre-training stage of MoE LLMs. In contrast to previous expert pruning approaches that operate primarily in the post-training phase, the proposed algorithm enhances training efficiency by selectively pruning underutilized experts and reorganizing experts across computing devices according to token distribution statistics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LAEP effectively reduces model size and substantially improves pre-training efficiency. In particular, when pre-training the 1010B Base model from scratch, LAEP achieves a 48.3\\% improvement in training efficiency alongside a 33.3% parameter reduction, while still delivering excellent performance across multiple domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAEP\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728MoE LLMs\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "MoE\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u6d3b\u8dc3\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e13\u5bb6\u526a\u679d\uff08LAEP\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6839\u636etoken\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u526a\u679d\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u8de8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bbe\u5907\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u914d", "result": "\u5728\u4ece\u5934\u9884\u8bad\u7ec31010B\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cLAEP\u5b9e\u73b048.3%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c33.3%\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u79c0\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "LAEP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11MoE LLMs\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MoE\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this paper, we investigate the role of behavioral traits as an explicit characterization layer to regulate agents' propensities across posting, re-sharing, commenting, reacting, and inactivity. Through large-scale simulations involving 980 agents and validation against real-world social media data, we demonstrate that behavioral traits are essential to sustain heterogeneous, profile-consistent participation patterns and enable realistic content propagation dynamics through the interplay of amplification- and interaction-oriented profiles.

In this study, we analyze the interaction between speaker embeddings and linguistically motivated phonological rules in accented speech synthesis. Using American and British English as a case study, we implement rules for flapping, rhoticity, and vowel correspondences. We propose the phoneme shift rate (PSR), a novel metric quantifying how strongly embeddings preserve or override rule-based transformations.

Such shortcomings stem from two key factors: (1) methodological complexity - agent orchestration is performed using sequential, code-level execution that limits global system-level holistic reasoning and scales poorly with agent complexity - and (2) efficacy uncertainty - MAS are deployed without understanding if there are tangible benefits compared to single-agent systems (SAS). We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA. Together, MAS-Orchestra and MASBENCH enable better training and understanding of MAS in the pursuit of multi-agent intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While the Hover Card interface facilitated seamless, on-demand verification during the task, the Aligned Sidebar uniquely mitigated the negative effects of information overload: as citation density increased, Sidebar users demonstrated significantly higher critical thinking and synthesis scores compared to other conditions.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise. This recalibration strategy significantly clarifies feature representations, and effectively mitigates the persistent challenge of emotional interference. Additionally, READ-Net can be easily integrated into existing frameworks for improved performance.

Current co-design practices, including workshops and AI-assisted frameworks, struggle with low user engagement, inefficient preference collection, and difficulties in balancing user feedback with design considerations. To address these challenges, we conducted a formative study with designers and users experienced in co-design (N=7), identifying critical challenges for current collaboration between designers and users in the co-design process, and their requirements. Informed by these insights, we introduce DesignBridge, a multi-platform AI-enhanced interactive system that bridges designer expertise and user preferences through three stages: (1) Initial Design Framing, where designers define initial concepts. (2) Preference Expression Collection, where users intuitively articulate preferences via interactive tools. (3) Preference-Integrated Design, where designers use AI-assisted analytics to integrate feedback into cohesive designs. A user study demonstrates that DesignBridge significantly enhances user preference collection and analysis, enabling designers to integrate diverse preferences with professional expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We have fine-tuned selected open-source LLMs on a specially developed dataset to enhance their statistical reasoning capabilities, and compared their performance with the human scores used as a benchmark. Our results show that the fine-tuned models achieve better performance on advanced statistical tasks on the level comparable to a statistics student. Fine-tuning demonstrates architecture-dependent improvements, with some models showing significant performance gains, indicating clear potential for deployment in educational technology and statistical analysis assistance systems. We also show that LLMs themselves can be far better judges of the answers quality (including explanation and reasoning assessment) in comparison to traditional metrics, such as BLEU or BertScore.

ICAI'25: 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence https://american-cse.org/csce2025/conferences-ICAI", "summary": "Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6846\u67b6SFAA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u624b\u52a8\u533f\u540d\u5316\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5173\u952e\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u539f\u610f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6846\u67b6SFAA\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533f\u540d\u5316\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u533f\u540d\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u6291\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u5730LLM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u533f\u540d\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u548cLLM\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0882\u4e2a\u9762\u5bf9\u9762\u8bbf\u8c08\u548c93\u4e2aAI\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bbf\u8c08\uff09\uff0cLLM\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u9605\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u3002Phi\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc791%\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u4e1494.8%\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u5730LLM\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6846\u67b6SFAA\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u3002"}}

Through co-design sessions with five clinicians, we propose MIND, a large language model-powered dashboard designed to present clinically relevant multimodal data insights for mental healthcare. MIND presents multimodal insights through narrative text, complemented by charts communicating underlying data. Our user study (N=16) demonstrates that clinicians perceive MIND as a significant improvement over baseline methods, reporting improved performance to reveal hidden and clinically relevant data insights (p<.001) and support their decision-making (p=.004).

To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method. Specifically, we design a novel frame-level semantic alignment attention mechanism and integrate it into a keyframe selector, which guides the Transformer-based generator within the adversarial framework to better reconstruct videos.

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling. IB-GRPO then uses the $I_{\u03b5+}$ dominance indicator to compute group-relative advantages over multiple objectives, avoiding manual scalarization and improving Pareto trade-offs.

Yet these systems are predominantly trained on typed instructions written while viewing the target chart (typed existing-chart data). While the cognitive processes for describing an existing chart arguably differ from those for creating a new chart, the structural differences in the corresponding prompts remain underexplored. We present empirical findings on the structural differences among spoken imagined-chart instructions, typed imagined-chart instructions, and typed existing-chart instructions for chart creation, showing that imagined-chart prompts contain richer command formats, element specifications, and complex linguistic features, especially in spoken instructions. We then compare the performance of systems trained on spoken imagined-chart data versus typed existing-chart data, finding that the first system outperforms the second one on both voice and text input, highlighting the necessity of targeted training on spoken imagined-chart data. We conclude with design guidelines for chart-authoring systems to improve performance in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6253\u5b57\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6253\u5b57\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u5143\u7d20\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53e3\u5934\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6253\u5b57\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u6253\u5b57\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u60f3\u8c61\u4e2d\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u3002\u63cf\u8ff0\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u4e0e\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u6253\u5b57\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6253\u5b57\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f7f\u7528\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u6253\u5b57\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u63d0\u793a\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u547d\u4ee4\u683c\u5f0f\u3001\u5143\u7d20\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u53e3\u5934\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6253\u5b57\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53e3\u5934\u60f3\u8c61\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u56fe\u8868\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

However, existing formulations rely on \\textit{deterministic} regression objectives, which mask probabilistic semantics and limit its applicability in stochastic control. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \\textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines. By enabling principled uncertainty estimation (e.g. constructing credible intervals via sampling) while remaining likelihood-free regarding observations, VJEPA provides a foundational framework for scalable, robust, uncertainty-aware planning in high-dimensional, noisy environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VJEPA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u5316\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709JEPA\u4f7f\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u968f\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6982\u7387\u5316\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8868\u793a\u574d\u584c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVJEPA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faBJEPA\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eVJEPA\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aVJEPA\u548cBJEPA\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u793a\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "VJEPA\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u89c2\u5bdf\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

However, current LLMs often generate plausible-looking but ineffective ideas. Execution grounding may help, but it is unclear whether automated execution is feasible and whether LLMs can learn from the execution feedback. To investigate these, we first build an automated executor to implement ideas and launch large-scale parallel GPU experiments to verify their effectiveness. We then convert two realistic research problems - LLM pre-training and post-training - into execution environments and demonstrate that our automated executor can implement a large fraction of the ideas sampled from frontier LLMs. We analyze two methods to learn from the execution feedback: evolutionary search and reinforcement learning. Execution-guided evolutionary search is sample-efficient: it finds a method that significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline (69.4% vs 48.0%) on post-training, and finds a pre-training recipe that outperforms the nanoGPT baseline (19.7 minutes vs 35.9 minutes) on pre-training, all within just ten search epochs. Frontier LLMs often generate meaningful algorithmic ideas during search, but they tend to saturate early and only occasionally exhibit scaling trends. Reinforcement learning from execution reward, on the other hand, suffers from mode collapse.

This paradigm implicitly assumes that the agent's CoT faithfully reflects both its internal reasoning and the underlying environment state. We show this assumption is brittle: LLM judges are highly susceptible to manipulation of agent reasoning traces. By systematically rewriting agent CoTs while holding actions and observations fixed, we demonstrate that manipulated reasoning alone can inflate false positive rates of state-of-the-art VLM judges by up to 90% across 800 trajectories spanning diverse web tasks. We study manipulation strategies spanning style-based approaches that alter only the presentation of reasoning and content-based approaches that fabricate signals of task progress, and find that content-based manipulations are consistently more effective. We evaluate prompting-based techniques and scaling judge-time compute, which reduce but do not fully eliminate susceptibility to manipulation. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in LLM-based evaluation and highlight the need for judging mechanisms that verify reasoning claims against observable evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u88c1\u5224\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4fdd\u6301\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u64cd\u7eb5LLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u975e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u73af\u5883\u88c1\u5224\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u80fd\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u9760\u5c1a\u9700\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u88c1\u5224\u662f\u5426\u6613\u53d7\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u64cd\u7eb5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u548c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u5199\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9SOTA VLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u5f0f\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\uff08\u6539\u53d8\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u8ff0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\uff08\u865a\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7b49\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5728800\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f51\u9875\u4efb\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u5c06\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u6bd4\u6837\u5f0f\u64cd\u7eb5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u6613\u53d7\u64cd\u7eb5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u64cd\u7eb5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u88c1\u5224\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u88c1\u5224\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u5173\u4e4eLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPAS-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u5206\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9891\u7387\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u632f\u5e45\u53cd\u6620\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAS-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7528LocalMamba\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u652f\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5706\u5f62\u9891\u7387\u57df\u626b\u63cf(CFDS)\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4\uff09\u53cc\u57df\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757(DDCFM)\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u632f\u5e45\u76f8\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728IXI\u548cfastMRI\u819d\u5173\u8282\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u632f\u5e45\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u8868\u793a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Here we show that large language models (LLMs) suffer from similar limitations in their ability to approximate what decisions they would make under counterfactual knowledge in offsetting gender and race biases and overcoming sycophancy. We show that prompting models to ignore or pretend not to know biasing information fails to offset these biases and occasionally backfires. However, unlike humans, LLMs can be given access to a ground-truth model of their own counterfactual cognition -- their own API. We show that this access to the responses of a blinded replica enables fairer decisions, while providing greater transparency to distinguish implicit from intentionally biased behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aAutoDriDM\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b6650\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u95f4\u7684\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5e26\u6765\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6AutoDriDM\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u573a\u666f\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76846650\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fde\u63a5\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoDriDM\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent works have proposed reinforcement learning approaches for training LLM tutors, but these methods focus solely on optimizing visible responses while neglecting the model's internal thinking process. We introduce PedagogicalRL-Thinking, a framework that extends pedagogical alignment to reasoning LLMs in education through two novel approaches: (1) Pedagogical Reasoning Prompting, which guides internal reasoning using domain-specific educational theory rather than generic instructions; and (2) Thinking Reward, which explicitly evaluates and reinforces the pedagogical quality of the model's reasoning traces. Our experiments reveal that domain-specific, theory-grounded prompting outperforms generic prompting, and that Thinking Reward is most effective when combined with pedagogical prompting. Furthermore, models trained only on mathematics tutoring dialogues show improved performance on educational benchmarks not seen during training, while preserving the base model's factual knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that pedagogical thinking reward produces systematic reasoning trace changes, with increased pedagogical reasoning and more structured instructional decision-making in the tutor's thinking process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPedagogicalRL-Thinking\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5b66\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316LLM\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5916\u663e\u56de\u590d\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6559\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5185\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9650\u5236\u4e86LLM\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u6559\u5b66\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u793a\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6559\u80b2\u7406\u8bba\u800c\u975e\u901a\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\n2. \u601d\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u601d\u7ef4\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u6559\u5b66\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u8f85\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u6559\u80b2\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "PedagogicalRL-Thinking\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6559\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u7684LLM\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic data environments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of cumulative advertiser value under budget constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eAI\u751f\u6210\u7ade\u4ef7\uff08AIGB\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6DARA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728AI\u751f\u6210\u7ade\u4ef7\uff08AIGB\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u9762\u4e34\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5177\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51faGRPO-Adaptive\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faDARA\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ba1\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u4e3b\u7d2f\u79ef\u4ef7\u503c\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DARA\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06LLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0eAIGB\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7ade\u4ef7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study assessed the visual and cognitive demands associated with an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agent (Gemini Live) during on-road driving, comparing it against handsfree phone calls, visual turn-by-turn guidance (low load baseline), and the Operation Span (OSPAN) task (high load anchor). Thirty-two licensed drivers completed five secondary tasks while visual and cognitive demands were measured using the Detection Response Task (DRT) for cognitive load, eye-tracking for visual attention, and subjective workload ratings. Results indicated that Gemini Live interactions (both single-turn and multi-turn) and hands-free phone calls shared similar levels of cognitive load, between that of visual turn-by-turn guidance and OSPAN. Exploratory analysis showed that cognitive load remained stable across extended multi-turn conversations. All tasks maintained mean glance durations well below the well-established 2-second safety threshold, confirming low visual demand. Furthermore, drivers consistently dedicated longer glances to the roadway between brief off-road glances toward the device during task completion, particularly during voice-based interactions, rendering longer total-eyes-off-road time findings less consequential. Subjective ratings mirrored objective data, with participants reporting low effort, demands, and perceived distraction for Gemini Live. These findings demonstrate that advanced LLM conversational agents, when implemented via voice interfaces, impose cognitive and visual demands comparable to established, low-risk hands-free benchmarks, supporting their safe deployment in the driving environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624bGemini Live\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u514d\u63d0\u901a\u8bdd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\u4e14\u5747\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u5185\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5206\u5fc3\u662f\u8f66\u8f86\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u8f66\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "32\u540d\u6301\u7167\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u4e94\u79cd\u6b21\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\uff1aGemini Live\u5355\u8f6e/\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u3001\u514d\u63d0\u901a\u8bdd\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a(\u4f4e\u8d1f\u8377\u57fa\u7ebf)\u548cOSPAN\u4efb\u52a1(\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8377\u951a\u70b9)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528DRT\u6d4b\u91cf\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6d4b\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "result": "Gemini Live\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u514d\u63d0\u901a\u8bdd\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ecb\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u548cOSPAN\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5747\u4f4e\u4e8e2\u79d2\u5b89\u5168\u9608\u503c\u3002\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u503e\u5411\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u89c6\u9053\u8def\u3002\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62a5\u544aGemini Live\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u5206\u5fc3\u611f\u77e5\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u97f3\u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u65bd\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u514d\u63d0\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMSR-HINE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u9690\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u901f\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c0f\u578b\u5355\u6b65\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u8fc5\u901f\u653e\u5927\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6eda\u51fa\u548c\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u5bf9\u6162\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMSR-HINE\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u901f\u7387\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u5faa\u73af\u72b6\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\u7ec6\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u540e\u9a8c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5f3a\u5236\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8f7b\u5ea6\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6821\u6b63\u5bf9\u9f50\u5faa\u73af\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eU-Net\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1a\u5728Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cH=400\u65f6\u7aef\u671fRMSE\u964d\u4f4e62.8%\uff0c\u7aef\u671fACC\u4ece-0.155\u63d0\u5347\u52300.828\uff08+0.983\uff09\uff0cACC>=0.5\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u4ece241\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230400\u6b65\uff1b\u5728Lorenz-96\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cH=100\u65f6RMSE\u964d\u4f4e27.0%\uff0c\u7aef\u671fACC\u4ece0.144\u63d0\u5347\u52300.545\uff08+0.402\uff09\uff0cACC>=0.5\u8303\u56f4\u4ece58\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u6b65\u3002", "conclusion": "MSR-HINE\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u9690\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f5c\u5728\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u6eda\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u6162\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion. These results highlight AG-LDM as an efficient, anatomically grounded framework for reliable brain MRI progression modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet human judgement remains paramount for high-stakes decision-making. This has fueled explorations of collaborative decision-making between humans and AI systems, aiming to leverage the strengths of both. To explore this dynamic, researchers conduct empirical studies, investigating how humans use AI assistance for decision-making and how this collaboration impacts results. A critical aspect of conducting these studies is the role of participants, often recruited through crowdsourcing platforms. The validity of these studies hinges on the behaviours of the participants, hence effective incentives that can potentially affect these behaviours are a key part of designing and executing these studies. In this work, we aim to address the critical role of incentive design for conducting empirical human-AI decision-making studies, focusing on understanding, designing, and documenting incentive schemes. Through a thematic review of existing research, we explored the current practices, challenges, and opportunities associated with incentive design for human-AI decision-making empirical studies. We identified recurring patterns, or themes, such as what comprises the components of an incentive scheme, how incentive schemes are manipulated by researchers, and the impact they can have on research outcomes. Leveraging the acquired understanding, we curated a set of guidelines to aid researchers in designing effective incentive schemes for their studies, called the Incentive-Tuning Framework, outlining how researchers can undertake, reflect on, and document the incentive design process. By advocating for a standardised yet flexible approach to incentive design and contributing valuable insights along with practical tools, we hope to pave the way for more reliable and generalizable knowledge in the field of human-AI decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although 3D self-supervised methods like volume contrast learning (VoCo) are powerful and partially address the labeling scarcity issue, their high computational cost and memory consumption are barriers. We propose 2D-VoCo, an efficient adaptation of the VoCo framework for slice-level self-supervised pre-training that learns spatial-semantic features from unlabeled 2D CT slices via contrastive learning. The pre-trained CNN backbone is then integrated into a CNN-LSTM architecture to classify multi-organ injuries. In the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma dataset, 2D-VoCo pre-training significantly improves mAP, precision, recall, and RSNA score over training from scratch.

This representational mismatch creates an unmeasured fragility wherein reasoning processes can fail. LLMs may treat two internal representations as distinct \"words\" even when they are semantically identical at the text level. In this work, we show that tokenization can betray LLM reasoning through one-to-many token ID mappings. We introduce a tokenization-consistency probe that requires models to replace designated target words in context while leaving all other content unchanged. The task is intentionally simple at the surface level, enabling us to attribute failures to tokenizer-detokenizer artifacts rather than to knowledge gaps or parameter limitations. Through analysis of over 11000 replacement trials across state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, we find a non-trivial rate of outputs exhibit phantom edits: cases where models operate under the illusion of correct reasoning, a phenomenon arising from tokenizer-induced representational defects. We further analyze these cases and provide a taxonomy of eight systematic tokenizer artifacts, including whitespace-boundary shifts and intra-word resegmentation.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC. Moreover, we observe that enhanced captions with LFS leads to improved performance on video question answering.

We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation.

Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation.

The system reduced erroneous selections by up to 95% for dwell time and gaze and head, and was positively received by most users.

Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it.

KRROOD addresses this by treating knowledge as a first-class programming abstraction using native class structures, bridging the gap between the logic programming and OOP paradigms.

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples. Additionally, an asymmetric loss function is introduced to train a balanced classifier with larger margins, further enhancing generalizability.

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings.

Although CoT prompting enhances reasoning, its verbosity imposes substantial computational overhead. Recent works often focus exclusively on outcome alignment and lack supervision on the intermediate reasoning process. These deficiencies obscure the analyzability of the latent reasoning chain. To address these challenges, we introduce Render-of-Thought (RoT), the first framework to reify the reasoning chain by rendering textual steps into images, making the latent rationale explicit and traceable. Specifically, we leverage the vision encoders of existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) as semantic anchors to align the vision embeddings with the textual space. This design ensures plug-and-play implementation without incurring additional pre-training overhead. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression and substantial inference acceleration compared to explicit CoT.

In this paper, we argue that awareness offers a more productive and methodologically tractable alternative. We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains. By shifting the focus from artificial consciousness to being just aware enough, this approach aims to facilitate principled assessment, support design and oversight, and enable more constructive scientific and public discourse.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Two central challenges in this domain are pixel-level change detection and semantic change interpretation, particularly for complex forest dynamics. While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for data exploration, their integration with vision-language models (VLMs) for remote sensing image change interpretation (RSICI) remains underexplored, especially beyond urban environments. We introduce Forest-Chat, an LLM-driven agent designed for integrated forest change analysis. The proposed framework enables natural language querying and supports multiple RSICI tasks, including change detection, change captioning, object counting, deforestation percentage estimation, and change reasoning. Forest-Chat builds upon a multi-level change interpretation (MCI) vision-language backbone with LLM-based orchestration, and incorporates zero-shot change detection via a foundation change detection model together with an interactive point-prompt interface to support fine-grained user guidance. To facilitate adaptation and evaluation in forest environments, we introduce the Forest-Change dataset, comprising bi-temporal satellite imagery, pixel-level change masks, and multi-granularity semantic change captions generated through a combination of human annotation and rule-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that Forest-Chat achieves strong performance on Forest-Change and on LEVIR-MCI-Trees, a tree-focused subset of LEVIR-MCI, for joint change detection and captioning, highlighting the potential of interactive, LLM-driven RSICI systems to improve accessibility, interpretability, and analytical efficiency in forest change analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Forest-Chat\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8ba1\u6570\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4e3a\u589e\u5f3a\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Forest-Chat\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9aa8\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u6392\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7528\u6237\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86Forest-Change\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53d8\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cForest-Chat\u5728Forest-Change\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cLEVIR-MCI-Trees\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u8054\u5408\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684RSICI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Forest-Chat\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u68ee\u6797\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Based on PsyFIRE, we construct the ClientResistance corpus with 23,930 annotated utterances from real-world Chinese text-based counseling, each supported by context-specific rationales. Leveraging this dataset, we develop RECAP, a two-stage framework that detects resistance and fine-grained resistance types with explanations.\n  RECAP achieves 91.25% F1 for distinguishing collaboration and resistance and 66.58% macro-F1 for fine-grained resistance categories classification, outperforming leading prompt-based LLM baselines by over 20 points.

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for un- derstanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi- behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional trans- formers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behav- ior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study constructs the first Chinese film script continuation benchmark comprising 53 classic films, and designs a multi-dimensional evaluation framework comparing GPT-5.2 and Qwen-Max-Latest. Using a \"first half to second half\" continuation paradigm with 3 samples per film, we obtained 303 valid samples (GPT-5.2: 157, 98.7% validity; Qwen-Max: 146, 91.8% validity). Evaluation integrates ROUGE-L, Structural Similarity, and LLM-as-Judge scoring (DeepSeek-Reasoner).\n  Statistical analysis of 144 paired samples reveals: Qwen-Max achieves marginally higher ROUGE-L (0.2230 vs 0.2114, d=-0.43); however, GPT-5.2 significantly outperforms in structural preservation (0.93 vs 0.75, d=0.46), overall quality (44.79 vs 25.72, d=1.04), and composite scores (0.50 vs 0.39, d=0.84). The overall quality effect size reaches large effect level (d>0.8).\n  GPT-5.2 excels in character consistency, tone-style matching, and format preservation, while Qwen-Max shows deficiencies in generation stability.

This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning \"future\" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark. Our study highlights that visual autoregressive models need foresight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness. Fine-tuned LLMs, particularly LLaMA-3.1-8B, produce CFs with high plausibility (up to 99%), strong validity (up to 0.99), and realistic, behaviorally modifiable feature adjustments.

Decisions are executed through formally correct approval processes, yet no entity possesses both the authority to approve those decisions and the epistemic capacity to meaningfully understand their basis.\n  We define this condition as responsibility vacuum: a state in which decisions occur, but responsibility cannot be attributed because authority and verification capacity do not coincide. We show that this is not a process deviation or technical defect, but a structural property of deployments where decision generation throughput exceeds bounded human verification capacity.\n  We identify a scaling limit under standard deployment assumptions, including parallel agent generation, CI-based validation, and individualized human approval gates. Beyond a throughput threshold, verification ceases to function as a decision criterion and is replaced by ritualized approval based on proxy signals. Personalized responsibility becomes structurally unattainable in this regime.\n  We further characterize a CI amplification dynamic, whereby increasing automated validation coverage raises proxy signal density without restoring human capacity. Under fixed time and attention constraints, this accelerates cognitive offloading in the broad sense and widens the gap between formal approval and epistemic understanding. Additional automation therefore amplifies, rather than mitigates, the responsibility vacuum.\n  We conclude that unless organizations explicitly redesign decision boundaries or reassign responsibility away from individual decisions toward batch- or system-level ownership, responsibility vacuum remains an invisible but persistent failure mode in scaled agent deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction. Therefore, they provide a flexible representation that allows the pretrained diffusion prior to regularize errors more effectively. By jointly conditioning on these latents and source camera poses, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the video re-rendering task.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings.

To alleviate the issues, we propose LcRL, a multilingual search-augmented reinforcement learning framework that integrates a language-coupled Group Relative Policy Optimization into the policy and reward models. We adopt the language-coupled group sampling in the rollout module to reduce knowledge bias, and regularize an auxiliary anti-consistency penalty in the reward models to mitigate the knowledge conflict.

Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, real-world tasks often demand both strategic planning and detailed implementation. Using a single agent for both leads to context pollution from debugging traces and intermediate failures, impairing long-horizon performance. We propose CodeDelegator, a multi-agent framework that separates planning from implementation via role specialization. A persistent Delegator maintains strategic oversight by decomposing tasks, writing specifications, and monitoring progress without executing code. For each sub-task, a new Coder agent is instantiated with a clean context containing only its specification, shielding it from prior failures. To coordinate between agents, we introduce Ephemeral-Persistent State Separation (EPSS), which isolates each Coder's execution state while preserving global coherence, preventing debugging traces from polluting the Delegator's context.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space.

The proposed Markov decision process for the vehicle routing problem incorporates the node features, the network adjacency matrix and the edge features as components of the state space. We incorporate the remaining finite time horizon into the network embedding module to provide a proper routing context to the embedding module. We integrate our embedding module with a policy gradient-based deep Reinforcement Learning framework to solve the vehicle routing problem with finite time horizon. We trained and validated our proposed routing method on real-world routing networks, as well as synthetically generated Euclidean networks.

To appear in The Web Conference 2026", "summary": "Federated Rank Learning (FRL) is a promising Federated Learning (FL) paradigm designed to be resilient against model poisoning attacks due to its discrete, ranking-based update mechanism. Unlike traditional FL methods that rely on model updates, FRL leverages discrete rankings as a communication parameter between clients and the server. This approach significantly reduces communication costs and limits an adversary's ability to scale or optimize malicious updates in the continuous space, thereby enhancing its robustness. This makes FRL particularly appealing for applications where system security and data privacy are crucial, such as web-based auction and bidding platforms. While FRL substantially reduces the attack surface, we demonstrate that it remains vulnerable to a new class of local model poisoning attack, i.e., fine-grained control attacks. We introduce the Edge Control Attack (ECA), the first fine-grained control attack tailored to ranking-based FL frameworks. Unlike conventional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that cause conspicuous disruptions, ECA enables an adversary to precisely degrade a competitor's accuracy to any target level while maintaining a normal-looking convergence trajectory, thereby avoiding detection. ECA operates in two stages: (i) identifying and manipulating Ascending and Descending Edges to align the global model with the target model, and (ii) widening the selection boundary gap to stabilize the global model at the target accuracy. Extensive experiments across seven benchmark datasets and nine Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) show that ECA achieves fine-grained accuracy control with an average error of only 0.224%, outperforming the baseline by up to 17x. Our findings highlight the need for stronger defenses against advanced poisoning attacks.

Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation.

This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability.

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command. Without requiring new data, BayesianVLA significantly improves generalization. Extensive experiments across on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa demonstrate substantial gains, including an 11.3% improvement on the challenging OOD SimplerEnv benchmark, validating the ability of our approach to robustly ground language in action.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faBayesianVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u584c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6d88\u5931\uff08\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u584c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBayesianVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u522b\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8cp(a|v)\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u540e\u9a8c\u03c0(a|v,\u2113)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u70b9\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u89c6\u89c9\u6377\u5f84\u5e76\u5956\u52b1\u660e\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cBayesianVLA\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728SimplerEnv\u548cRoboCasa\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684OOD SimplerEnv\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9711.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "BayesianVLA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u606f\u5d29\u584c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u89e3\u5f3a\u8feb\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

Despite the impressive in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing methods are hindered by their reliance on static, heuristic-driven prompting strategies. Due to the lack of reflection mechanisms required to internalize erroneous signals, these methods exhibit vulnerability in semantic ambiguity, often making erroneous extraction patterns permanent. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Knowledge Reconstruction-driven Prompt Optimization (KRPO) framework to assist LLMs in continuously improving their extraction capabilities for complex ORTE task flows. Specifically, we design a self-evaluation mechanism based on knowledge restoration, which provides intrinsic feedback signals by projecting structured triplets into semantic consistency scores. Subsequently, we propose a prompt optimizer based on a textual gradient that can internalize historical experiences to iteratively optimize prompts, which can better guide LLMs to handle subsequent extraction tasks. Furthermore, to alleviate relation redundancy, we design a relation canonicalization memory that collects representative relations and provides semantically distinct schemas for the triplets.

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy. Our framework achieves significantly higher alignment with this optimal policy than a deterministic value iteration alternative that uses the same similarity-based model, demonstrating the superiority of our ensemble planner.

To mitigate this limitation, we present \\textsc{LogicScore}, a unified evaluation framework that shifts the paradigm from local assessment to global reasoning scrutiny. Grounded in Horn Rules, our approach integrates a backward verification mechanism to systematically evaluate three key reasoning dimensions: \\textit{Completeness} (logically sound deduction), \\textit{Conciseness} (non-redundancy), and \\textit{Determinateness} (consistent answer entailment). Extensive experiments across three multi-hop QA datasets (HotpotQA, MusiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) and over 20 LLMs (including GPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, LLaMA3, and task-specific tuned models) reveal a critical capability gap: leading models often achieve high attribution scores (e.g., 92.85\\% precision for Gemini-3 Pro) but struggle with global reasoning quality (e.g., 35.11\\% Conciseness for Gemini-3 Pro).

Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality.

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image. Experiments show that our system reduces service latency by 33% compared with baselines while maintaining competitive image quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u524d\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf33%\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fa7\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c3a\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u5408\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u524d\u666f\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u5757\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u653e\u5927\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u62fc\u63a5\u5f97\u5230\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u670d\u52a1\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8633%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7aef\u8fb9\u534f\u540c\u751f\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with \"rich-get-richer\" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood.

Prototype-based FL mitigates this issue by exchanging class-wise feature prototypes instead of full model parameters; however, existing methods still suffer from suboptimal generalization under severe communication constraints. In this paper, we propose RefProtoFL, a communication-efficient FL framework that integrates External-Referenced Prototype Alignment (ERPA) for representation consistency with Adaptive Probabilistic Update Dropping (APUD) for communication efficiency. Specifically, we decompose the model into a private backbone and a lightweight shared adapter, and restrict federated communication to the adapter parameters only. To further reduce uplink cost, APUD performs magnitude-aware Top-K sparsification, transmitting only the most significant adapter updates for server-side aggregation. To address representation inconsistency across heterogeneous clients, ERPA leverages a small server-held public dataset to construct external reference prototypes that serve as shared semantic anchors. For classes covered by public data, clients directly align local representations to public-induced prototypes, whereas for uncovered classes, alignment relies on server-aggregated global reference prototypes via weighted averaging.

Seventeen chest radiologists participated, and they marked \"Agree all\", \"Agree mostly\" or \"Disagree\" to indicate their assessment of the correctness of the LLM suggested labels. Each chest radiograph was evaluated by three experts. Of these, at least two radiologists selected \"Agree All\" for 381 radiographs. From this set, 200 were selected, prioritizing those with less common or multiple finding labels, and divided into 100 released radiographs and 100 reserved as the holdout dataset. The holdout dataset is used exclusively by RSNA to independently evaluate different models. A benchmark of 200 chest radiographic studies with 12 benchmark labels was created and made publicly available https://imaging.rsna.org, with each chest radiograph verified by three radiologists.

However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework designed to automate the generation of instance-specific evaluation rubrics. Our approach grounds evaluation in authoritative medical evidence by decomposing retrieved content into atomic facts and synthesizing them with user interaction constraints to form verifiable, fine-grained evaluation criteria. Evaluated on HealthBench, our framework achieves a Clinical Intent Alignment (CIA) score of 60.12%, a statistically significant improvement over the GPT-4o baseline (55.16%). In discriminative tests, our rubrics yield a mean score delta ($\u03bc_\u0394 = 8.658$) and an AUROC of 0.977, nearly doubling the quality separation achieved by GPT-4o baseline (4.972). Beyond evaluation, our rubrics effectively guide response refinement, improving quality by 9.2% (from 59.0% to 68.2%).

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point.

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As submission numbers rise and research communities grow, the decline in review quality is a popular narrative and a common concern. Yet, is it true? Review quality is difficult to measure, and the ongoing evolution of reviewing practices makes it hard to compare reviews across venues and time. To address this, we introduce a new framework for evidence-based comparative study of review quality and apply it to major AI and machine learning conferences: ICLR, NeurIPS and *ACL. We document the diversity of review formats and introduce a new approach to review standardization. We propose a multi-dimensional schema for quantifying review quality as utility to editors and authors, coupled with both LLM-based and lightweight measurements. We study the relationships between measurements of review quality, and its evolution over time. Contradicting the popular narrative, our cross-temporal analysis reveals no consistent decline in median review quality across venues and years.

This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data.

In this work, we contribute to the theoretical analysis of this latter approach, with a particular focus on classification with distributional inputs using SVMs. We establish a new oracle inequality and derive consistency and learning rate results. Furthermore, for SVMs using the hinge loss and Gaussian kernels, we formulate a novel variant of an established noise assumption from the binary classification literature, under which we can establish learning rates.

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns.

Across four controlled experiments, we show that metadata conditioning consistently improves in-region performance without sacrificing cross-region generalization, enables global models to recover localization comparable to region-specific models, and improves learning efficiency. Our ablation studies demonstrate that URL-level metadata alone captures much of the geographic signal, while balanced regional data coverage remains essential, as metadata cannot fully compensate for missing regions.

Beyond extraction, we introduce autonomous taxonomy maintenance where an AI agent analyzes evaluation feedback to identify problematic categories, diagnose failure patterns, and propose refinements, achieving 104.7% improvement in embedding separation in a case study. External validation confirms the taxonomy captures economically meaningful structure: same-industry companies exhibit 63% higher risk profile similarity than cross-industry pairs (Cohen's d=1.06, AUC 0.82, p<0.001).

For homogeneous CD, precise boundary delineation relies on fine-grained spatial cues and local pixel interactions, whereas heterogeneous CD instead requires broader contextual information to suppress speckle noise and geometric distortions. Moreover, difference operator (e.g., subtraction) works well for aligned homogeneous images but introduces artifacts in cross-modal or geometrically misaligned scenarios. Across different modality settings, specialized models based on static backbones or fixed difference operations often prove insufficient. To address this challenge, we propose UniRoute, a unified framework for modality-adaptive learning by reformulating feature extraction and fusion as conditional routing problems. We introduce an Adaptive Receptive Field Routing MoE (AR2-MoE) module to disentangle local spatial details from global semantic context, and a Modality-Aware Difference Routing MoE (MDR-MoE) module to adaptively select the most suitable fusion primitive at each pixel. In addition, we propose a Consistency-Aware Self-Distillation (CASD) strategy that stabilizes unified training under data-scarce heterogeneous settings by enforcing multi-level consistency.

To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets.

Prior research has highlighted sentiment as an important signal in fake news detection, either by analyzing which sentiments are associated with fake news or by using sentiment and emotion features for classification. However, this poses a vulnerability since adversaries can manipulate sentiment to evade detectors especially with the advent of large language models (LLMs). A few studies have explored adversarial samples generated by LLMs, but they mainly focus on stylistic features such as writing style of news publishers. Thus, the crucial vulnerability of sentiment manipulation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of state-of-the-art fake news detectors under sentiment manipulation. We introduce AdSent, a sentiment-robust detection framework designed to ensure consistent veracity predictions across both original and sentiment-altered news articles. Specifically, we (1) propose controlled sentiment-based adversarial attacks using LLMs, (2) analyze the impact of sentiment shifts on detection performance. We show that changing the sentiment heavily impacts the performance of fake news detection models, indicating biases towards neutral articles being real, while non-neutral articles are often classified as fake content. (3) We introduce a novel sentiment-agnostic training strategy that enhances robustness against such perturbations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdSent significantly outperforms competitive baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while also generalizing effectively to unseen datasets and adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods.

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches.

However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u65e0\u7ebf\u94fe\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1aI\u9636\u6bb5\u2014\u672c\u5730\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbe\u5907-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1bII\u9636\u6bb5\u2014\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u566a\u58f0/\u8870\u843d\u5931\u771f\u7279\u5f81\uff1bIII\u9636\u6bb5\u2014\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u989d\u5916\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1-\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eRGB-\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To remedy this downside, we propose POTR, a post-training 3DGS codec built on two novel techniques. First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality. Finally, we extend POTR with a simple fine-tuning scheme to further enhance pruning, inference, and rate-distortion performance.

Deep semantic mismatch rumors, which superficially align images and texts, pose particular challenges and threaten online public opinion. Existing multimodal rumor detection methods improve cross modal modeling but suffer from limited feature extraction, noisy alignment, and inflexible fusion strategies, while ignoring external factual evidence necessary for verifying complex rumors. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal rumor detection model enhanced with external evidence and forgery features. The model uses a ResNet34 visual encoder, a BERT text encoder, and a forgery feature module extracting frequency-domain traces and compression artifacts via Fourier transformation. BLIP-generated image descriptions bridge image and text semantic spaces.

Current methods struggle with a difficult credit assignment problem and rely on regret approximations that fail to identify challenging levels, both of which are compounded as the size of the environment grows. We propose Dynamic Environment Generation for UED (DEGen) to enable a denser level generator reward signal, reducing the difficulty of credit assignment and allowing for UED to scale to larger environment sizes.

Unlike conventional U-Net variants that predict masks in a single pass, MTFlow learns vector fields that iteratively transport noisy masks toward the ground truth, enabling interpretable, trajectory-based refinement. Our architecture combines a U-Net backbone with temporal embeddings, allowing the model to capture the dynamics of uncertainty resolution along filament boundaries. We trained and evaluated MTFlow on synthetic and real microtubule datasets and assessed its generalization capability on public biomedical datasets of curvilinear structures such as retinal blood vessels and nerves.

Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration.

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars.

We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead.

One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups. Our experiments show that L-RAPM provides improved predictive power than the currently used baseline, and this improvement increases as the sample size for the lineups gets smaller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7bee\u7403\u7b49\u4f53\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7403\u5458\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u9635\u5bb9\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08L-RAPM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u9891\u7e41\u6362\u4eba\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9635\u5bb9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7403\u5458\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u9635\u5bb9\uff09\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u6362\u4eba\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u2014\u2014\u4f8b\u5982NBA\u7403\u961f\u6bcf\u8d5b\u5b63\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8fc7600\u4e2a\u9635\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9635\u5bb9\u4ec5\u7ecf\u538625-30\u6b21\u8fdb\u653b\u56de\u5408\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u516c\u5f00\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u65e0\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9635\u5bb9\u9762\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u6210\u9635\u5bb9\u7684\u7403\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cL-RAPM\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u968f\u7740\u9635\u5bb9\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u7684\u51cf\u5c0f\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9635\u5bb9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u624b\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u7403\u5458\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u9635\u5bb9\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

RadixMLP dynamically maps batches to a prefix trie, gathering shared segments into a compressed representation for position-wise computation and scattering results back only at attention boundaries.

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter).

We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories. Human evaluation shows that temporal competence is generally weak, with no model exceeding 75% accuracy across categories.

To overcome this, we propose a holistic, video-centric paradigm named \\textbf{L}ocal \\textbf{D}iffusion \\textbf{F}orcing for \\textbf{V}ideo \\textbf{F}rame \\textbf{I}nterpolation (LDF-VFI). Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, IIITD-20K, and UFine6926 demonstrate that a single Scale-TBPS model outperforms dataset-centric optimized models and naive joint training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams.

This limitation stems largely from current models' reliance on mono audio datasets, which lack the binaural spatial information needed to learn visual-to-spatial audio mappings. To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

This result provides strong justification for federated learning when dealing with complex tasks and high-dimensional input data, as aggregating knowledge from multiple institutions significantly benefits the learning process.

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

However, these models are computationally expensive and produce petabyte-scale outputs, which limits their utility for applications such as probabilistic risk assessment. Here, we present the Field-Space Autoencoder, a scalable climate emulation framework based on a spherical compression model that overcomes these challenges. By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation.

However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

To systematically assess this discrepancy, we introduce an interpretable, information-theoretic framework for auditing unlearning using Partial Information Decomposition (PID). By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif.

We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive gradient descent to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the gradient flow dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex.

Image classification experiments spanning 6 CNN architectures and 6 benchmarks demonstrate that ZENITH achieves higher test accuracy in lower wall-clock time than baselines.

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship.

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at describing what is visible, it remains unclear whether they can infer how far a task has progressed from partial observations. To this end, we introduce Progress-Bench, a benchmark for systematically evaluating progress reasoning in VLMs. Beyond benchmarking, we further explore a human-inspired two-stage progress reasoning paradigm through both training-free prompting and training-based approach based on curated dataset ProgressLM-45K. Experiments on 14 VLMs show that most models are not yet ready for task progress estimation, exhibiting sensitivity to demonstration modality and viewpoint changes, as well as poor handling of unanswerable cases. While training-free prompting that enforces structured progress reasoning yields limited and model-dependent gains, the training-based ProgressLM-3B achieves consistent improvements even at a small model scale, despite being trained on a task set fully disjoint from the evaluation tasks. Further analyses reveal characteristic error patterns and clarify when and why progress reasoning succeeds or fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86VLM\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Progress-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cProgressLM-45K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dProgressLM-3B\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u64c5\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ef\u89c1\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u5426\u4ece\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Progress-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eProgressLM-45K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u4e2aVLMs\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ProgressLM-3B\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570VLMs\u5c1a\u672a\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u5c55\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ProgressLM-3B\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5178\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories.

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively.

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowSSC\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u77ed\u8def\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b65\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u5355\u76eeRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u63a8\u65ad\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5df2\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5408\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FlowSSC\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002FlowSSC\u5c06SSC\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988SSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u77ed\u8def\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u6b65\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u77ed\u8def\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728SemanticKITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowSSC\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowSSC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u573a\u666f\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Developing robust perception algorithms requires large-scale, high-quality datasets that cover diverse driving conditions and support thorough evaluation. Existing datasets often lack a high-fidelity digital twin, limiting systematic testing, edge-case simulation, sensor modification, and sim-to-real evaluations. To address this gap, we present DrivIng, a large-scale multimodal dataset with a complete geo-referenced digital twin of a ~18 km route spanning urban, suburban, and highway segments. Our dataset provides continuous recordings from six RGB cameras, one LiDAR, and high-precision ADMA-based localization, captured across day, dusk, and night. All sequences are annotated at 10 Hz with 3D bounding boxes and track IDs across 12 classes, yielding ~1.2 million annotated instances. Alongside the benefits of a digital twin, DrivIng enables a 1-to-1 transfer of real traffic into simulation, preserving agent interactions while enabling realistic and flexible scenario testing. To support reproducible research and robust validation, we benchmark DrivIng with state-of-the-art perception models and publicly release the dataset, digital twin, HD map, and codebase.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D). We also show that RayRoPE can seamlessly incorporate RGB-D input, resulting in even larger gains over alternatives that cannot positionally encode this information.", "AI": {"tldr": "RayRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u89c6\u56feTransformer\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ebf\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5177\u5907SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff08\u7edd\u5bf9\u6216\u76f8\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4e09\u4e2a\u9700\u6c42\uff1a1\uff09\u552f\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u591a\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u9002\u5e94\u5e95\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5236\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRayRoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u7ebf\u8868\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u70b9\u800c\u975e\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\uff1b2\uff09\u4e3a\u8fbe\u5230SE(3)\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u591a\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u5e27\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u5750\u6807\uff1b3\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf3D\u70b9\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u6790\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u7acb\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1RayRoPE\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5728CO3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aLPIPS\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb15%\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660eRayRoPE\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u6574\u5408RGB-D\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6b64\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "RayRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56feTransformer\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7ebf\u8868\u793a\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation.

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data. Driven by these insights, we introduce a refined four-stage data pipeline, resulting in RoVid-X, the largest open-source robotic dataset for video generation with 4 million annotated video clips, covering thousands of tasks and enriched with comprehensive physical property annotations.

Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline.

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
