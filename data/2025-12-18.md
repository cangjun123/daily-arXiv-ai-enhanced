Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

*Opeyemi Bamigbade,Mark Scanlon,John Sheppard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS)：融合全局注意力与局部自一致性评估的双模块框架，用于AI生成图像的取证检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的技术进步带来了数字证据真实性验证的新挑战。现有方法大多缺乏明确的异常强度度量，且无法有效检测视觉一致的伪造内容。

Method: VAAS采用双模块框架：1. 基于Vision Transformer的全局注意力异常估计；2. 基于SegFormer嵌入的块级自一致性评分。这种混合方法提供连续、可解释的异常分数。

Result: 在DF2023和CASIA v2.0数据集上的评估表明，VAAS在F1和IoU指标上具有竞争力，并通过注意力引导的异常图增强了可视化可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架将定量检测与人类可理解的推理相结合，支持透明可靠的图像完整性评估，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

*Tomohito Kawabata,Xinyu Zhang,Ling Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SocialNav-MoE，一个基于混合专家（MoE）的高效视觉语言模型，用于机器人在人群环境中的社会合规导航。通过强化学习微调和语义相似性奖励提升决策能力，在保持精度的同时降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在人群环境中导航时，以往研究主要关注安全性，而忽视社会合规性（如人的舒适度、社会规范和环境适宜性）。现有的视觉语言模型计算量大，不适合资源受限的机器人平台实时部署，因此需要开发高效的轻量化方案。

Method: 提出SocialNav-MoE，一个轻量级混合专家视觉语言模型。设计了语义相似性奖励函数来增强强化学习微调效果。研究了不同小型语言模型、路由策略和视觉编码器（CLIP vs. SigLIP，冻结vs.微调）的有效性。

Result: 在SNEI数据集上的实验显示，SocialNav-MoE在导航准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡。提出的语义相似性奖励函数比硬层级和字符级奖励更有效。

Conclusion: SocialNav-MoE为资源受限的机器人平台提供了高效的社会合规导航解决方案。语义相似性奖励能有效提升模型决策能力，未来工作将公开源代码。

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

### [5] [The Renaissance of Expert Systems: Optical Recognition of Printed Chinese Jianpu Musical Scores with Lyrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14758)
*Fan Bu,Rongfeng Li,Zijin Li,Ya Li,Linfeng Fan,Pei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对简谱（中国编号记谱法）的混合式光学音乐识别系统，不需要大规模标注数据，即可将带歌词的印刷简谱转换为MusicXML和MIDI格式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模光学音乐识别研究主要集中在西方五线谱上，而中国简谱及其丰富的歌词资源尚未得到充分探索，需要一个不依赖大量标注训练数据的解决方案。

Method: 采用自上而下的专家系统设计，结合传统计算机视觉技术（如乐句关联、骨架分析）利用先验知识，并集成无监督深度学习模块进行图像特征嵌入，形成混合策略。

Result: 在《中国民歌选集》上评估，系统成功数字化了超过5,000首纯旋律歌曲（＞30万音符）和1,400首带歌词歌曲（＞10万音符），旋律识别F1分数达0.951，歌词对齐F1分数达0.931。

Conclusion: 该混合方法在可解释性和准确性之间取得了平衡，为简谱的大规模数字化提供了一种高效且高精度的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [8] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench是多证据视频问答评估基准，要求整合至少三个非重叠时间线索验证复杂视觉推理，发现主流视频大模型表现仅略优于随机猜测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答基准通常只依赖单一视觉线索就能回答，未能充分评估模型对跨时间多证据的整合推理能力

Method: 构建包含2.6万道五选一选择题的HERBench基准，涵盖12项组合任务，引入最小必需帧集(MRFS)定量测量所需证据量

Result: 13个先进视频大模型在HERBench上仅获得31-42%准确率（随机基线20%），失败主要源于证据检索缺陷和融合缺陷

Conclusion: HERBench为评估视频多证据推理提供了量化标准，揭示了当前视频大模型在跨时间证据整合上的关键瓶颈

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将动物皮肤纹理转化为文字描述来进行跨模态身份识别的新方法，通过生成虚拟个体数据增强，显著提升了AI在生态监测中的识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动物再识别方法主要依赖视觉特征，但难以处理外形相似的个体。本研究受法医指纹学的启发，将动物毛皮拓扑结构转化为可解释的文字标签，旨在克服单纯视觉方法的局限性，实现文本到视觉的身份匹配。

Method: 1) 收集了185只老虎的3,355张图像，手动标注84,264个细节特征；2) 将皮肤纹理特征编码为人类可读的文字描述符；3) 开发了文本-图像协同合成流水线，生成包含数十张逼真图像和对应皮肤纹理文字的'虚拟个体'；4) 评估这种视觉-文字方法在跨模态身份检索中的性能。

Result: 1) 皮肤纹理文字描述能够有效编码动物毛皮拓扑结构；2) 数据增强显著提升了AI在跨模态检索中的准确性；3) 在真实场景基准测试中，该方法缓解了数据稀缺问题；4) 实现了基于人类可验证匹配的文本到视觉身份恢复。

Conclusion: 皮肤纹理语言引导的生物识别技术能够克服纯视觉方法的局限性，为生态监测中的描述性模态提供了语言驱动的统一框架。这代表了再识别可解释性的重要进展，推动了生态监测中描述性模态的语言驱动统一。

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

### [11] [PANDA-PLUS-Bench: A Clinical Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of AI Foundation Models in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14922)
*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA-PLUS-Bench是一个专门用于评估前列腺癌Gleason分级基础模型鲁棒性的基准数据集，揭示模型可能学习样本特异性伪影而非可泛化生物学特征的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI基础模型在前列腺癌Gleason分级中可能通过学习样本特异性伪影而非真正的生物学特征来获得高验证准确率，这限制了其在真实临床环境中的实用性和泛化能力。

Method: 创建PANDA-PLUS-Bench基准数据集，包含9名不同患者的9张全切片图像，提取512x512和224x224像素的非重叠组织斑块，应用8种增强条件。使用该基准评估7个基础模型分离生物学信号与样本级别混杂因素的能力。

Result: 模型表现差异显著：Virchow2在大型模型中样本级别编码最低（81.0%），但跨样本准确率第二低（47.2%）；HistoEncoder（专门针对前列腺组织训练）表现最佳，跨样本准确率最高（59.7%），样本级别编码最强（90.3%）。所有模型均存在样本内与跨样本准确率差距，范围在19.9-26.9个百分点之间。

Conclusion: PANDA-PLUS-Bench为基础模型评估提供了关键资源，可量化模型在前列腺癌Gleason分级任务中对样本级别伪影的敏感性。组织特异性训练可能有助于同时提升生物学特征捕捉能力和样本特异性特征识别能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

TL;DR: 这篇论文介绍了一个基于多任务学习融合声纹、人脸和姿态的三模态人员识别框架，在模态缺失时通过置信度加权保持鲁棒性，在CANDOR和VoxCeleb数据集上取得超过99%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的人员识别常面临模态缺失或质量下降的问题，现有方法难以在模态不完整时保持高精度，需要一个能自适应处理模态变化的鲁棒框架。

Method: 提出三模态识别系统，采用多任务学习独立处理各模态，通过跨注意力和门控融合机制实现模态交互，引入置信度加权融合策略动态适应模态缺失情况。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上达到99.18%的Top-1准确率，明显优于传统单模态和晚期融合方法；在VoxCeleb1数据集的双模态模式下达到99.92%准确率，且在模态缺失时仍保持高精度。

Conclusion: 提出的三模态框架在完整和缺失模态情况下都表现出色，为实际人员识别应用提供了鲁棒解决方案，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合局部嵌入和区域级可解释性的后处理图像水印方法，通过离散小波变换域嵌入和统计块策略生成检测图，揭示图像中可能被水印或篡改的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像水印方案多为黑盒操作，仅提供全局检测分数，无法展示水印存在的位置或方式，缺乏透明度影响用户信任且难以解释篡改影响。生成式AI的发展使得创建高度逼真的数字内容成为可能，但引发了关于真实性、所有权和滥用的担忧。

Method: 在离散小波变换域中使用统计块策略嵌入水印信号，结合局部化嵌入和区域级可解释性。该方法生成检测图，显示图像中可能被水印或篡改的区域。

Result: 方法在常见图像变换下具有强鲁棒性，同时对语义操作保持敏感，水印具有高度不可感知性。与其他后处理方法相比，该方法提供更可解释的检测同时保持竞争力强的鲁棒性（例如对裁剪至图像一半的鲁棒性）。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估视频问题生成模型质量的新协议，通过模拟与专家的问答交流来评估问题激发未知知识的能力，并构建了EgoExoAsk数据集用于训练检索器和新基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问题生成模型的评估主要关注问题回答能力，而不是生成问题的质量。研究人员希望评估问题在激发人类专家获取新知识方面的有效性，因为熟练的人类面试者能够从专家那里提取有价值信息。

Conclusion: 提出的评估协议和EgoExoAsk数据集有助于持续改进视频问题生成模型，特别是针对激发专家未知知识的能力。该方法为评估问题生成质量提供了新视角，而不仅仅是问题的可回答性。

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法在医学图像分割中存在模型特定性且依赖于低多样性预测采样的局限性

Method: 利用Dropout驱动的随机分割假设构建偏好一致性梯度，无需直接的真实标签监督，支持2D/3D CNN和Transformer架构

Result: 在多类医学数据集评估中，MAPO在边界贴合度、过拟合减少和优化稳定性方面均优于传统监督训练

Conclusion: MAPO提供了一种可扩展的、模型无关的医学图像分割偏好优化方法，有效提升分割质量和训练稳定性

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Abstract: Generating consistent human images with controllable pose and appearance is essential for applications in virtual try on, image editing, and digital human creation. Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

Motivation: 文本到图像生成模型快速发展，但商业产品如Nano Banana Pro作为传统低层级视觉任务的通用解决方案潜力未被充分探索，研究其是否能够成为低层级视觉全能模型。

Method: 通过简单文本提示进行零样本评估，在14个不同低层级任务和40个多样化数据集上进行测试，并与最先进的专用模型进行基准比较。

Result: 性能呈现明显二分：Nano Banana Pro在主观视觉质量方面表现优越，能生成合理的细节，但在传统基于参考的定量指标上落后于专用模型。

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro是低层级视觉任务的有力零样本竞争者，但实现与领域专用模型相同的高保真度仍然面临重大挑战。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

TL;DR: 该论文定义了一个新的人力动作规范评估任务，并提出了包含大规模健身和武术视频的多层次标注数据集CoT-AFA，开发了带有思维链解释的评估框架，改善了动作分类和质量评估的准确性。

Motivation: 现有的视频理解方法主要关注动作是什么和在哪里，无法满足判断动作是否标准并提供改进反馈的需求。现有数据集缺乏动作标准化程度的标注，且动作质量评估数据集缺乏可解释性和详细反馈。

Method: 提出了CoT-AFA数据集，采用思维链解释范式提供完整推理过程。开发了可解释的健身评估器框架，采用双流处理和动态门控机制融合视觉和语义信息。

Conclusion: CoT-AFA数据集和方法在人类动作规范评估任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了良好基础，具有巨大潜力。数据集和源代码已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies. Our dataset and source code is available at https://github.com/MICLAB-BUPT/EFA.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于重合成的深度学习内容真实性验证框架，能够控制低误报率并抵御计算受限的对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法存在两大缺陷：无法区分记忆样本等非真实内容导致误报率无界；检测方法缺乏鲁棒性，攻击者可用极少计算资源适配已知检测器。需要一种能确定样本真实性或是否可合理否认真实性的新方法。

Method: 提出一个基于重合成的验证框架，采用校准化的重合成技术，支持多模态并利用最先进的反演技术，专门针对高精度、低召回设置对抗计算受限的攻击者。

Result: 校准重合成方法在验证真实样本方面最可靠，能保持可控的低误报率；相比以往方法，该方法在相同计算预算下能实现对抗鲁棒性，而之前方法易被规避。

Conclusion: 该重合成框架为深度伪造检测提供了更可靠的解决方案，特别在控制误报率和抵御计算受限对抗攻击方面优于现有方法，适用于多模态真实性验证场景。

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

TL;DR: 针对低光环境下红外与可见光图像融合传统评估指标的缺陷，我们提出了一个新的评估指标TBC（目标-背景对比度），重点关注目标的相对对比度变化，而不是全局统计特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的无参考评价指标（如熵和平均梯度）在复杂的低光照环境中表现不佳，它们会将高频传感器噪声误解为有效细节，形成“噪声陷阱”，错误地对噪声图像给出更高评分，误导融合算法。

Method: 我们借鉴韦伯定律，关注显著目标的相对对比度而不是全局统计，提出目标-背景对比度（Target-Background Contrast, TBC）指标，该指标对背景噪声进行惩罚，同时对目标可见性进行奖励。

Result: 在DroneVehicle数据集上的实验表明，TBC与人类感知的一致性更好，能够为低空场景提供可靠的评估标准。

Conclusion: 目标-背景对比度（TBC）指标解决了传统指标在低光照环境中存在的问题，能够更准确评估红外和可见光图像融合质量，特别是在低空无人机侦察这类对目标可见性要求较高的场景中。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了跨模态对齐一致性（CMAC-MMD）训练框架，用于解决医学AI中的交叉偏见问题，能均衡诊断确定性，无需在临床推理中使用敏感人口统计数据，并在皮肤病和青光眼检测中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学AI系统，特别是多模态视觉语言模型，常表现出交叉偏见，导致对边缘化患者子群的诊断置信度更低，造成误诊、漏诊增加。现有公平性干预方法往往无法有效解决这些差距，或在实现统计平等时损害总体诊断性能。

Method: 开发了Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency（CMAC-MMD）训练框架，通过跨模态对齐来标准化交叉患者子群间的诊断确定性。该方法在临床推理过程中不需要敏感人口统计数据，与传统去偏见方法不同，它均衡了模型决策置信度。

Result: 在皮肤病数据集（HAM10000）上，该方法将交叉漏诊差距（ΔTPR）从0.50降至0.26，同时总体AUC从0.94提升至0.97。在青光眼筛查（Harvard-FairVLMed）中，ΔTPR从0.41降至0.31，AUC从0.71提升至0.72。外部验证也证实了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CMAC-MMD建立了一个可扩展的框架，可开发高风险的临床决策支持系统，既能保持准确性，又能确保在不同患者子群间公平、可靠地运行，且不增加隐私风险。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Mamba架构的跨模态上下文融合框架MMMamba，通过新型多模态交替扫描机制实现高清全色图像与低分辨率多光谱图像的高效融合，并支持零样本图像超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法在跨模态信息融合方面存在局限，而交叉注意力机制虽然能实现全局交互但计算效率低且会稀释细粒度对应关系。因此需要一种既能保持高效计算又能有效捕捉复杂语义关系的新方法。

Method: 1. 基于Mamba架构构建跨模态上下文融合框架，确保线性计算复杂度；2. 引入多模态交替扫描机制，促进PAN和MS模态间的有效信息交换；3. 支持零样本图像超分辨率。

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试中，该方法相比现有最先进技术表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: MMMamba框架通过高效的跨模态融合机制，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现了优秀的全色锐化性能，为解决多模态图像融合问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image level labels aims to produce pixel level predictions without requiring dense annotations. While recent approaches have leveraged generative models to augment existing data, they remain dependent on real world training samples. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction, Zero Shot Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (ZSWSSS), and propose SynthSeg Agents, a multi agent framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data entirely without real images. SynthSeg Agents comprises two key modules, a Self Refine Prompt Agent and an Image Generation Agent. The Self Refine Prompt Agent autonomously crafts diverse and semantically rich image prompts via iterative refinement, memory mechanisms, and prompt space exploration, guided by CLIP based similarity and nearest neighbor diversity filtering. These prompts are then passed to the Image Generation Agent, which leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize candidate images. A frozen CLIP scoring model is employed to select high quality samples, and a ViT based classifier is further trained to relabel the entire synthetic dataset with improved semantic precision. Our framework produces high quality training data without any real image supervision. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO 2014 show that SynthSeg Agents achieves competitive performance without using real training images. This highlights the potential of LLM driven agents in enabling cost efficient and scalable semantic segmentation.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.

Motivation: MRI运动伪影会降低图像质量并增加患者复查率，现有的自动化质量评估方法多局限于二元决策且缺乏可解释性，需要开发能够跨不同MRI对比度和方向评估运动伪影的可解释框架。

Method: 该框架使用监督对比学习来学习运动严重程度的判别性表征，然后在此特征空间中计算针对每个运动等级的亲和力分数，量化图像与各等级的距离，从而实现透明可解释的等级分配。

Result: 在超过5000个专家标注的脑MRI切片（涵盖多种对比度和视图）上的实验表明，亲和力分数与专家判断良好对齐，支持其作为运动严重程度的可解释性度量指标。

Conclusion: AutoMAC-MRI通过准确的分级检测和逐级亲和力评分，支持MRI的在线质量监控，具有减少不必要重扫描和提高工作流程效率的潜力。

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper we propose MECAD, a novel approach for continual anomaly detection using a multi-expert architecture. Our system dynamically assigns experts to object classes based on feature similarity and employs efficient memory management to preserve the knowledge of previously seen classes. By leveraging an optimized coreset selection and a specialized replay buffer mechanism, we enable incremental learning without requiring full model retraining. Our experimental evaluation on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrates that the optimal 5-expert configuration achieves an average AUROC of 0.8259 across 15 diverse object categories while significantly reducing knowledge degradation compared to single-expert approaches. This framework balances computational efficiency, specialized knowledge retention, and adaptability, making it well-suited for industrial environments with evolving product types.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏在图像异常检测中因输入与监督信号过于相似而容易过度泛化，需要一种新方法来增强其区分正常与异常的能力。

Method: 提出掩码反向知识蒸馏（MRKD），采用图像级掩码（ILM）捕获全局信息以区分输入与监督信号，并通过特征级掩码（FLM）引入合成的特征级异常来保留局部信息。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上取得优异性能：图像级AU-ROC达98.9%，像素级AU-ROC达98.4%，AU-PRO达95.3%；消融实验验证了MRKD能有效缓解过度泛化问题。

Conclusion: MRKD通过双级掩码机制增强了图像上下文捕获能力并抑制了过度泛化，为图像异常检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

Motivation: 随着视觉模型能力的不断提升，虽然它们在目标检测、图像分类等任务上表现出色，但能够像人类一样从图像中准确获取定量测量值的模型仍然很少。在实验室自动化环境中，机器人需要具备读取仪器刻度值的基本技能，以实现完整的自主操作能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种有效的图像处理方法来读取线性刻度测量值，在实验室自动化环境中具有实用价值，能够帮助机器人获得类似人类的测量读取能力。

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

Motivation: 人类对话包含言语和非语言线索的双向动态交互，现有方法或将说与听视为独立过程，或依赖非因果的全序列建模，导致跨轮次的时序连贯性受限。

Method: 提出TIMAR框架，将对话建模为交替音频-视觉上下文，在每个轮次内融合多模态信息，应用轮次级因果注意力积累对话历史，通过轻量扩散头预测连续的3D头部动态。

Result: 在DualTalk基准测试中，TIMAR将Fréchet距离和MSE降低了15-30%，在分布外数据上也取得类似提升。

Conclusion: TIMAR通过轮次级交替掩码自回归方法，有效建模3D对话头部生成的因果动态，显著提升生成结果的连贯性和表现力。

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data. The source code will be released in the GitHub repository https://github.com/CoderChen01/towards-seamleass-interaction.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了视觉文本压缩（VTC）对视觉语言模型长文本理解能力的影响，并提出了首个VTC基准测试，发现尽管VLM能很好地解码文本信息，但在处理VTC压缩信息时表现出较差的长文本理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉文本压缩（VTC）通过将长文本转换为密集的二维视觉表示，实现了3-20倍的令牌压缩比，但其对视觉语言模型核心长文本理解能力的影响尚未得到充分研究。需要建立基准系统评估VTC压缩信息对VLM长文本理解能力的影响。

Method: 建立了首个VTC基准测试，包括三个长文本理解场景：VTC检索（信息检索与聚合）、VTC推理（基于最小词汇重叠的潜在关联推断），以及VTC记忆（长期对话记忆中的综合问答）。此外还建立了VTCBench-Wild来模拟多样化输入场景，并全面评估领先的开源和专有模型。

Result: 研究结果表明，尽管大多数VLM能够很好地解码文本信息（如OCR），但在处理VTC压缩信息时表现出令人惊讶的较差长文本理解能力，无法捕捉上下文中的长关联或依赖关系。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了对VTC的深入理解，并为设计更高效和可扩展的VLM奠定了基础，揭示了当前VLM在处理压缩视觉信息时面临的长文本理解挑战。

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

Motivation: 传统的早期融合CNN在多路组织成像数据处理中假设各通道（蛋白标记）共享结构，可能忽视了标记间的独立性，限制了模型从罕见细胞中学习特异性信息的能力，特别是在样本量有限的情况下。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的浅层通道独立模型（CIM-S，仅5.5K参数），并与早期融合CNN进行对比。使用霍奇金淋巴瘤CODEX数据集（145,000个细胞，49个标记）进行对比预训练和线性评估，实验涵盖多种自监督框架和数据增强设置。

Result: 通道独立架构（特别是CIM-S）获得了更强的表示能力，尤其在罕见细胞识别任务上明显优于早期融合模型。这些发现在不同自监督框架、增强设置和标记数量（49个和18个）下都保持稳定。

Conclusion: 轻量级、通道独立的架构可以匹配甚至超越深度早期融合CNN和基础模型，为多路组织成像数据的表示学习提供了更合适的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability. The framework's source code is available at https://github.com/aghasemzadeh/OpenRUMPL

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: BLANKET方法在保护婴儿隐私的同时，能更好地保持面部属性和视频质量，为婴儿视频数据的安全使用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

Motivation: 遥感图像分割面临标注数据有限的问题，且航拍图像与自然图像存在差异，这需要在有限监督下进行有效适配。SAM3的概念驱动框架为此提供了可能。

Method: 在四类目标上评估SAM3，比较文本、几何和混合提示策略，结合轻量级微调和零样本推理。监督程度逐步增加以观察性能变化。

Result: 语义与几何线索结合的策略在所有目标和指标上表现最佳。纯文本提示效果最差，特别是对于不规则形状的目标。轻量级微调对几何规则且视觉显著的目标提供了实用的性能-努力权衡。适度几何标注即可实现有效适应。

Conclusion: 组合语义和几何线索的提示策略最适合遥感图像分割。有限监督下的几何标注即可显著提升性能，但欠分割和边界不准确问题仍是遥感任务的主要挑战，尤其对不规则和罕见目标。

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems.

Conclusion: IMKD通过多级知识蒸馏有效保持了雷达和相机传感器的本质特性，同时增强了它们的互补优势，在3D目标检测任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/dfki-av/IMKD/.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar通过统一的多视图和单目数据训练，成功解决了单图像3D头部化身创建中的完整性问题，实现了更好的3D重建质量和动画表现力。

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进的SfM方法，通过优化特征点采样和视图增量添加策略，显著提升径向畸变严重相机的位姿估计精度（从40.4%提升到79.9%）

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

*Morgan Coe,Gruffudd Jones,Leah-Nani Alconcel,Marina Gashinova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在亚太赫兹ISAR图像序列中检测和跟踪卫星外部结构特征的方法，用于增强空间域感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着近地空间人造物体数量快速增长，需要详细的空间域感知信息。基于空间的亚THz ISAR成像系统可以在不受大气影响的情况下实现亚厘米级分辨率，但需要可靠的特征检测和跟踪方法来识别卫星外部结构。

Method: 1) 使用元启发式模拟器生成不同部署场景下的ISAR图像序列；2) 通过仿射变换实现帧间初始对齐；3) 采用梯度比法进行边缘检测；4) 使用双加权Hough变换准确检测线性特征；5) 在整个图像序列中跟踪特征演化。

Result: 研究表明，所提出的特征跟踪方法提高了特征检测和分类的可信度，并展示了将阴影作为特征的鲁棒检测用例。该方法在高达100公里范围内实现了亚厘米分辨率的成像。

Conclusion: 在ISAR图像序列中使用特征跟踪能够增加对卫星外部结构特征检测和分类的置信度，为空间域感知提供有效的技术手段，特别是在检测阴影等特征方面表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

### [63] [OccSTeP: Benchmarking 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15621)
*Yu Zheng,Jie Hu,Kailun Yang,Jiaming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了4D占据时空持续性(OccSTeP)新概念来解决自动驾驶中的反应式预测和主动式预测任务，并建立了包含挑战性场景的新基准。针对该任务提出了OccSTeP-WM模型，使用基于体素的场景状态和线性复杂度注意力机制来捕获长期时空依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要持久理解3D场景，该理解需要具有时间扰动鲁棒性，并能考虑潜在的未来动作。为了同时解决'接下来会发生什么'(反应式预测)和'给定特定未来动作会发生什么'(主动式预测)两个任务，需要新的方法和评价基准。

Method: 提出OccSTeP-WM世界模型，采用无tokenizer设计，维护稠密体素场景状态并随时间增量融合时空上下文。使用线性复杂度注意力骨干和循环状态空间模块来捕获长程空间依赖，同时通过自运动补偿持续更新场景记忆。

Result: 实验证明OccSTeP概念和OccSTeP-WM模型的有效性，在OccSTeP基准上取得了平均语义mIoU 23.70%(提升6.56%)和占据IoU 35.89%(提升9.26%)的性能。

Conclusion: OccSTeP概念为解决自动驾驶中的时空预测问题提供了新框架，所提出的OccSTeP-WM模型在在线推理、鲁棒性方面表现良好，即使历史传感器输入缺失或有噪声也能保持性能。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

TL;DR: 本研究提出AllSky模型，该模型直接从物理捕获的HDRI中学习，解决了现有方法无法同时支持写实性和全动态范围的局限，实现了用户对阳光和云层位置的直观控制，达到了最先进的天空建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前天空模型无法真实再现自然天空，生成的HDR环境贴图在色调、阴影和光照方面与物理捕获的HDR图像存在差异，缺乏对22档光圈的FDR支持，限制了其在写实渲染和相关应用中的可行性。

Method: 提出AllSky灵活的全天气天空模型，直接从物理捕获的HDRI中学习，研究输入模态、色调映射、条件设置和模型评估方法，并实现用户对太阳和云层位置的直观控制。

Result: AllSky模型实现了最先进的天空建模性能，通过实验证明现有DNN天空模型无法与物理捕获的HDRI或参数化天空模型互换使用，当前局限性阻碍了下游应用的可扩展性和精确照明。 

Conclusion: 该研究在HDR天空建模方面取得重要进展，AllSky模型通过从物理捕获数据中直接学习，提供了更真实的天空表示和用户控制功能，但现有DNN方法仍存在可扩展性和精确照明方面的限制。

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

*Yuanhang Li,Yiren Song,Junzhe Bai,Xinran Liang,Hu Yang,Libiao Jin,Qi Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC-Effect是一个基于指令引导和DiT架构的少样本视频特效编辑框架，能够在严格保持时空一致性的同时合成复杂特效（如火焰、粒子、卡通角色）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频特效编辑面临重大挑战：注入的特效必须与背景无缝融合，背景必须完全保持不变，且需要从有限的配对数据中高效学习特效模式。现有视频编辑模型无法满足这些要求，因此需要新方案来解决背景精确保持与自然特效注入的问题。

Method: 1）利用源视频作为干净的上下文条件，发挥DiT模型的上下文学习能力来实现精确的背景保持和自然的特效注入；2）采用两阶段训练策略：先进行通用编辑适配，再通过Effect-LoRA进行特效特异性学习；3）引入时空稀疏化标记化方法以提升计算效率；4）构建并发布了包含15种高质量视觉风格的配对VFX编辑数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，IC-Effect能够实现高质量、可控且时间一致性的视频特效编辑，为视频创作开辟了新的可能性。

Conclusion: IC-Effect通过创新的指令引导DiT框架和高效的训练策略，成功解决了视频VFX编辑中背景保持、特效融合和计算效率等关键挑战，为少样本视频特效编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种将合成图像数据与神经风格迁移相结合的训练数据增强流程，以解决深度视觉模型对常见损坏的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度视觉模型在面对常见的图像损坏（如模糊、噪声等）时表现脆弱，现有的数据增强方法在提高模型对这些损坏的鲁棒性方面仍有局限。研究旨在探索如何有效结合合成图像和风格迁移来增强模型的抗损坏能力。

Method: 1. 提出一个结合合成图像数据和神经风格迁移的训练数据增强管道
2. 对增强方法及其关键超参数对图像分类器性能的影响进行系统性实证分析
3. 探讨风格化与合成数据的互补性及其与流行规则数据增强技术（如TrivialAugment）的结合方式

Result: 1. 虽然风格迁移会降低合成图像的FID指标质量，但这些图像在模型训练中表现出意外的益处
2. 风格化和合成数据能够良好互补，并且可以与TrivialAugment等规则增强技术结合
3. 在多个小规模图像分类数据集上取得了最先进的损坏鲁棒性：
   - CIFAR-10-C: 93.54%鲁棒准确率
   - CIFAR-100-C: 74.9%鲁棒准确率
   - TinyImageNet-C: 50.86%鲁棒准确率

Conclusion: 结合合成图像数据与神经风格迁移的增强方法是有效的，能够显著提高深度视觉模型对常见图像损坏的鲁棒性。风格迁移虽然会降低图像质量指标，但在训练中却带来积极效果，这种组合方法可以与某些现有增强技术协同工作，为提升模型鲁棒性提供了新途径。

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型存在曝光偏差问题，现有方法通常依赖双向教师模型或在线鉴别器，需要后训练微调。本研究旨在开发一个无需教师的端到端训练框架。

Method: 提出了Resampling Forcing框架：包括自我重采样方案（在训练时模拟推理阶段的模型误差）、稀疏因果掩码（强制时间因果关系的同时支持并行训练）和历史路由机制（动态检索最相关历史帧以支持长序列生成）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法性能与基于蒸馏的基线相当，且在更长视频中表现出更优越的时间一致性。

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing提供了一个无需教师模型的解决方案，能够实现自回归视频模型的规模化训练，并改善长视频生成的一致性。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

Conclusion: 从AR到扩散的范式转换非常有效；直接转换AR语言模型为扩散VLM是可行的；少量训练数据下就能实现性能全面提升和推理加速。

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

Abstract: At the most basic level, pixels are the source of the visual information through which we perceive the world. Pixels contain information at all levels, ranging from low-level attributes to high-level concepts. Autoencoders represent a classical and long-standing paradigm for learning representations from pixels or other raw inputs. In this work, we demonstrate that autoencoder-based self-supervised learning remains competitive today and can produce strong representations for downstream tasks, while remaining simple, stable, and efficient. Our model, codenamed "Pixio", is an enhanced masked autoencoder (MAE) with more challenging pre-training tasks and more capable architectures. The model is trained on 2B web-crawled images with a self-curation strategy with minimal human curation. Pixio performs competitively across a wide range of downstream tasks in the wild, including monocular depth estimation (e.g., Depth Anything), feed-forward 3D reconstruction (i.e., MapAnything), semantic segmentation, and robot learning, outperforming or matching DINOv3 trained at similar scales. Our results suggest that pixel-space self-supervised learning can serve as a promising alternative and a complement to latent-space approaches.

Abstract: OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.

Conclusion: T5Gemma 2成功将T5Gemma适配方法扩展到多模态场景，通过架构改进提升了效率，验证了编码器-解码器架构的优势，并为研究社区提供了可用的预训练模型。

Abstract: We introduce T5Gemma 2, the next generation of the T5Gemma family of lightweight open encoder-decoder models, featuring strong multilingual, multimodal and long-context capabilities. T5Gemma 2 follows the adaptation recipe (via UL2) in T5Gemma -- adapting a pretrained decoder-only model into an encoder-decoder model, and extends it from text-only regime to multimodal based on the Gemma 3 models. We further propose two methods to improve the efficiency: tied word embedding that shares all embeddings across encoder and decoder, and merged attention that unifies decoder self- and cross-attention into a single joint module. Experiments demonstrate the generality of the adaptation strategy over architectures and modalities as well as the unique strength of the encoder-decoder architecture on long context modeling. Similar to T5Gemma, T5Gemma 2 yields comparable or better pretraining performance and significantly improved post-training performance than its Gemma 3 counterpart. We release the pretrained models (270M-270M, 1B-1B and 4B-4B) to the community for future research.

TL;DR: 本文改进了一个用于分析媒体观点的自动化流程，通过微调大语言模型（LLMs）进行观点分类，并利用 Wikidata 中的实体信息丰富主张表示，从而在移民辩论语料上实现了更佳的分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解新闻来源在民主社会中的角色至关重要，需要评估媒体环境的平衡与公正性。现有的自动化分析流程在观点识别和分类上仍有改进空间，尤其是在处理复杂话题时。

Method: 研究方法包括：1) 对给定新闻语料库，采用混合人机方法识别话题下的观点范围；2) 微调大语言模型进行观点分类；3) 利用 Wikidata 中的语义描述信息来丰富主张表示；4) 在英国移民辩论的 Benchmark 上评估对比。

Result: 实验表明，微调大语言模型和丰富主张表示这两个机制都能独立提升分类性能，而二者的结合效果最佳，尤其是当使用能够处理长输入的大语言模型时。

Conclusion: 通过整合微调的大语言模型和语义丰富的主张表示，可以显著改进新闻观点的自动化分析，特别是在处理复杂社会议题时，该方法为评估媒体话语平衡性提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: News sources play a central role in democratic societies by shaping political and social discourse through specific topics, viewpoints and voices. Understanding these dynamics is essential for assessing whether the media landscape offers a balanced and fair account of public debate. In earlier work, we introduced a pipeline that, given a news corpus, i) uses a hybrid human-machine approach to identify the range of viewpoints expressed about a given topic, and ii) classifies relevant claims with respect to the identified viewpoints, defined as sets of semantically and ideologically congruent claims (e.g., positions arguing that immigration positively impacts the UK economy). In this paper, we improve this pipeline by i) fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for viewpoint classification and ii) enriching claim representations with semantic descriptions of relevant actors drawn from Wikidata. We evaluate our approach against alternative solutions on a benchmark centred on the UK immigration debate. Results show that while both mechanisms independently improve classification performance, their integration yields the best results, particularly when using LLMs capable of processing long inputs.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate large language model (LLM) performance on pharmacy licensure-style question-answering (QA) tasks and develop an external knowledge integration method to improve their accuracy.
  Methods: We benchmarked eleven existing LLMs with varying parameter sizes (8 billion to 70+ billion) using a 141-question pharmacy dataset. We measured baseline accuracy for each model without modification. We then developed a three-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, DrugRAG, that retrieves structured drug knowledge from validated sources and augments model prompts with evidence-based context. This pipeline operates externally to the models, requiring no changes to model architecture or parameters.
  Results: Baseline accuracy ranged from 46% to 92%, with GPT-5 (92%) and o3 (89%) achieving the highest scores. Models with fewer than 8 billion parameters scored below 50%. DrugRAG improved accuracy across all tested models, with gains ranging from 7 to 21 percentage points (e.g., Gemma 3 27B: 61% to 71%, Llama 3.1 8B: 46% to 67%) on the 141-item benchmark.
  Conclusion: We demonstrate that external structured drug knowledge integration through DrugRAG measurably improves LLM accuracy on pharmacy tasks without modifying the underlying models. This approach provides a practical pipeline for enhancing pharmacy-focused AI applications with evidence-based information.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The quadratic computational complexity of MultiHead SelfAttention (MHSA) remains a fundamental bottleneck in scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) for longcontext tasks. While sparse and linearized attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate this, they often compromise the representation of global dependencies or fail to capture multiscale semantic granularity effectively. In this paper, we propose Multiscale Aggregated Hierarchical Attention (MAHA), a novel architectural framework that reformulates the attention mechanism through hierarchical decomposition and mathematically rigorous aggregation. Unlike conventional approaches that treat token interactions at a single resolution, MAHA dynamically partitions the input sequence into hierarchical scales via learnable downsampling operators. The core innovation lies in its aggregation strategy: we model the fusion of scalespecific attention matrices as a resource allocation problem, solved via a convex optimization framework or a Nash equilibriumbased gametheoretic approach. This ensures a theoretically optimal balance between local nuance and global context fidelity. Implemented within a hybrid dilatedconvolutional transformer backbone, MAHA utilizes differentiable optimization layers to enable endtoend training. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MAHA achieves superior scalability; empirical FLOPs analysis confirms an 81% reduction in computational cost at a sequence length of 4096 compared to standard attention. This work bridges the gap between optimization theory and sequence modeling, offering a scalable solution for nextgeneration LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI在多语言支持上存在资源不平等问题，低资源语言如罗马尼亚语缺乏足够的跨模态数据集。为了促进AI民主化，需要为这些语言开发多模态NLP资源，缩小与高资源语言之间的差距

Method: 1. 将广泛使用的Flickr30k数据集翻译为罗马尼亚语
2. 利用开源LLM将其扩展为视觉问答数据集
3. 选择LLaMA 3.2、LLaVA 1.6、Qwen2三个主流模型系列进行微调
4. 采用参数高效的LoRA方法进行模型适配

Result: 1. Qwen2-VL-RoVQA（70亿参数）在两个任务上均获得最高分：
   - 视觉问答：相比原始版本BERTScore F1提升+6.05%
   - 图像描述生成：BERTScore F1提升+2.61%
2. 所有模型在未训练任务（罗马尼亚语图像描述）上也展现改进
3. 语法错误显著减少，罗马尼亚语流畅度明显提高

Conclusion: 本研究成功为罗马尼亚语创建了首个大规模多模态数据集，通过参数高效微调方法显著提升了开源视觉语言模型的罗马尼亚语能力。研究不仅改善了视觉问答性能，还增强了模型的跨任务迁移能力和语言流畅性，为其他低资源语言的多模态AI发展提供了可复制的框架

Abstract: Focusing on low-resource languages is an essential step toward democratizing generative AI. In this work, we contribute to reducing the multimodal NLP resource gap for Romanian. We translate the widely known Flickr30k dataset into Romanian and further extend it for visual question answering by leveraging open-source LLMs. We demonstrate the usefulness of our datasets by fine-tuning open-source VLMs on Romanian visual question answering. We select VLMs from three widely used model families: LLaMA 3.2, LLaVA 1.6, and Qwen2. For fine-tuning, we employ the parameter-efficient LoRA method. Our models show improved Romanian capabilities in visual QA, as well as on tasks they were not trained on, such as Romanian image description generation. The seven-billion-parameter Qwen2-VL-RoVQA obtains top scores on both tasks, with improvements of +6.05% and +2.61% in BERTScore F1 over its original version. Finally, the models show substantial reductions in grammatical errors compared to their original forms, indicating improvements not only in language understanding but also in Romanian fluency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态科学推理，特别是在化学领域，对大语言模型仍是一个重大挑战。化学问题解决依赖于符号图示、分子结构等视觉数据，但当前模型在处理这些多模态信息方面存在明显不足。

Method: 作者使用美国国家化学奥林匹克竞赛超过20年的试题构建基准，系统评估了40个专有和开源多模态大语言模型，包括GPT-5、o3、Gemini-2.5-Pro等，通过思维链提示、消融研究和遮挡分析等技术分析模型表现。

Result: 研究发现许多模型在多模态融合方面表现不佳，在某些情况下移除图像甚至能提高准确率，这表明视觉-语言整合存在错位问题。思维链提示能一致性地提高准确率和视觉基础能力。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在科学推理能力上存在重要局限，需要开发更鲁棒、可解释的化学多模态系统。该工作为领域特定多模态AI的进步提供了及时基准，并强调了AI与科学推理交叉领域需要进一步进展的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal scientific reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), particularly in chemistry, where problem-solving relies on symbolic diagrams, molecular structures, and structured visual data. Here, we systematically evaluate 40 proprietary and open-source multimodal LLMs, including GPT-5, o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL, on a curated benchmark of Olympiad-style chemistry questions drawn from over two decades of U.S. National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO) exams. These questions require integrated visual and textual reasoning across diverse modalities. We find that many models struggle with modality fusion, where in some cases, removing the image even improves accuracy, indicating misalignment in vision-language integration. Chain-of-Thought prompting consistently enhances both accuracy and visual grounding, as demonstrated through ablation studies and occlusion-based interpretability. Our results reveal critical limitations in the scientific reasoning abilities of current MLLMs, providing actionable strategies for developing more robust and interpretable multimodal systems in chemistry. This work provides a timely benchmark for measuring progress in domain-specific multimodal AI and underscores the need for further advances at the intersection of artificial intelligence and scientific reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务导向的公共信道通信（如海事VHF对话）存在非正式语言和隐式话题转换，传统方法对此处理有限，需要更有效的话题分割方法。

Method: DASH-DTS框架包含三个核心贡献：1）通过对话握手识别检测话题转换；2）基于相似度的示例选择进行上下文增强；3）生成选择性正负样本提升模型判别力和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明DASH-DTS在VHF-Dial和标准基准测试中实现了最可靠的分割准确率，为操作对话的稳定监控和决策支持提供了基础。

Conclusion: DASH-DTS框架能有效处理真实海事VHF对话的话题分割问题，提供可解释的推理和置信度评分，推动了该领域研究的发展。

Abstract: Dialogue Topic Segmentation (DTS) is crucial for understanding task-oriented public-channel communications, such as maritime VHF dialogues, which feature informal speech and implicit transitions. To address the limitations of traditional methods, we propose DASH-DTS, a novel LLM-based framework. Its core contributions are: (1) topic shift detection via dialogue handshake recognition; (2) contextual enhancement through similarity-guided example selection; and (3) the generation of selective positive and negative samples to improve model discrimination and robustness. Additionally, we release VHF-Dial, the first public dataset of real-world maritime VHF communications, to advance research in this domain. DASH-DTS provides interpretable reasoning and confidence scores for each segment. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves several sota segmentation trusted accuracy on both VHF-Dial and standard benchmarks, establishing a strong foundation for stable monitoring and decision support in operational dialogues.

Method: 提出SGM白盒神经元干预方法，使用专业知识加权的软抑制技术选择性重新校准少量有害专家神经元，中和有害跨模态激活。

Result: 在开源MLLMs上实验显示，SGM在标准及对抗性条件下将有害率从48.2%降至2.5%，同时保持生成流畅性和多模态推理能力。SGM*结合现有去毒方法进一步提升安全性。

Conclusion: SGM提供了一种可解释、低成本的多模态生成毒性控制方案，通过神经元级干预有效降低模型有害输出，并与其他去毒方法兼容。

Abstract: Disclaimer: Samples in this paper may be harmful and cause discomfort.
  Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable multimodal generation but inherit toxic, biased, and NSFW signals from weakly curated pretraining corpora, causing safety risks, especially under adversarial triggers that late, opaque training-free detoxification methods struggle to handle. We propose SGM, a white-box neuron-level multimodal intervention that acts like safety glasses for toxic neurons: it selectively recalibrates a small set of toxic expert neurons via expertise-weighted soft suppression, neutralizing harmful cross-modal activations without any parameter updates. We establish MM-TOXIC-QA, a multimodal toxicity evaluation framework, and compare SGM with existing detoxification techniques. Experiments on open-source MLLMs show that SGM mitigates toxicity in standard and adversarial conditions, cutting harmful rates from 48.2\% to 2.5\% while preserving fluency and multimodal reasoning. SGM is extensible, and its combined defenses, denoted as SGM*, integrate with existing detoxification methods for stronger safety performance, providing an interpretable, low-cost solution for toxicity-controlled multimodal generation.

Abstract: The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from stochastic chat interfaces to reliable software components necessitates a fundamental re-engineering of interaction paradigms. Current methodologies, predominantly heuristic-based "prompt engineering," fail to provide the deterministic guarantees required for mission-critical applications. We introduce the Meta-Prompting Protocol, a rigorous theoretical framework that formalizes the orchestration of LLMs as a programmable, self-optimizing system. Central to this protocol is the Adversarial Trinity, a tripartite topology comprising a Generator (P), an Auditor (A), and an Optimizer (O). By treating natural language instructions as differentiable variables within a semantic computation graph and utilizing textual critiques as gradients, this architecture mitigates hallucination and prevents model collapse. We demonstrate the theoretical viability of this approach using declarative programming paradigms (DSPy) and automatic textual differentiation (TextGrad), establishing a foundation for "Observable Software Engineering" in the era of probabilistic computing.

Motivation: 测试时强化学习依赖多数投票作为伪标签，但这种方法容易产生确认偏差且奖励稀疏，限制了性能提升。

Method: SCOPE框架集成步骤级置信度加权伪标签推导和动态子群划分，优先高质量推理路径，平衡推理质量与探索多样性，通过重复采样获得局部共识作为监督目标。

Result: 在不同模型和基准上实验，SCOPE均优于现有基线，在AIME 2025上相对提升13.1%，在AMC上提升8.1%。

Conclusion: SCOPE能有效解决测试时强化学习的确认偏差和稀疏奖励问题，显著提升大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Test-time reinforcement learning mitigates the reliance on annotated data by using majority voting results as pseudo-labels, emerging as a complementary direction to reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). However, this voting strategy often induces confirmation bias and suffers from sparse rewards, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we propose subgroup-specific step-wise confidence-weighted pseudo-label estimation (SCOPE), a framework integrating model confidence and dynamic subgroup partitioning to address these issues. Specifically, SCOPE integrates the proposed step-wise confidence into pseudo label deduction, prioritizing high-quality reasoning paths over simple frequency count. Furthermore, it dynamically partitions the candidate outputs pool into independent subgroups by balancing reasoning quality against exploration diversity. By deriving local consensus via repeat sampling for each sub group, SCOPE provides diverse supervision targets to encourage broader exploration. We conduct experiments across various models and benchmarks, experimental results show that SCOPE consistently outperforms recent baselines. Notably, SCOPE achieving relative improvements of 13.1\% on challenging AIME 2025 and 8.1\% on AMC.

Motivation: 学生越来越多地使用ChatGPT等工具生成复杂输出，导致传统基于成品的评估方法失去有效性，需要新的评估体系来解决这一错位问题。

Method: 提出了一种受多因素认证启发的教学多因素评估（P-MFA）模型，这是一个基于过程、多证据的评估框架。

Result: 研究论证了在生成工具普及背景下，传统评估方法的局限性，并展示了过程化评估的必要性。

Abstract: This paper explores the growing epistemic parallel between NLG evaluation and grading of students in a Finnish University. We argue that both domains are experiencing a Great Misalignment Problem. As students increasingly use tools like ChatGPT to produce sophisticated outputs, traditional assessment methods that focus on final products rather than learning processes have lost their validity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RFKG-CoT是一种改进的知识图谱-思维链方法，通过关系驱动的自适应跳数选择器和少量样本上下文学习路径指导机制，解决了现有方法在知识密集型QA中的局限性，显著提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在知识密集型QA中由于参数知识限制容易产生幻觉。现有的KG-CoT方法虽然通过整合知识图谱路径提高了可靠性，但存在固定的跳数选择（仅由问题驱动）和对推理路径利用不足（缺乏指导）的问题。

Method: 提出了RFKG-CoT方法：1）用关系驱动的自适应跳数选择器替换固定的跳数选择器，通过激活知识图谱关系动态调整推理步骤；2）引入基于思维链的少量样本上下文学习路径指导机制，构建'问题-路径-答案'格式的示例来增强LLM对推理路径的理解能力。

Result: 在四个KGQA基准测试中，RFKG-CoT比KG-CoT的准确性提高了最高14.7个百分点（Llama2-7B在WebQSP上）。消融实验证实跳数选择器和路径提示是互补的，共同将知识图谱证据转化为更可信的答案。

Conclusion: RFKG-CoT通过自适应跳数选择和路径指导机制，有效增强了知识图谱与大型语言模型的集成，显著减少了知识密集型QA中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive QA due to parametric knowledge limitations. While existing methods like KG-CoT improve reliability by integrating knowledge graph (KG) paths, they suffer from rigid hop-count selection (solely question-driven) and underutilization of reasoning paths (lack of guidance). To address this, we propose RFKG-CoT: First, it replaces the rigid hop-count selector with a relation-driven adaptive hop-count selector that dynamically adjusts reasoning steps by activating KG relations (e.g., 1-hop for direct "brother" relations, 2-hop for indirect "father-son" chains), formalized via a relation mask. Second, it introduces a few-shot in-context learning path guidance mechanism with CoT (think) that constructs examples in a "question-paths-answer" format to enhance LLMs' ability to understand reasoning paths. Experiments on four KGQA benchmarks show RFKG-CoT improves accuracy by up to 14.7 pp (Llama2-7B on WebQSP) over KG-CoT. Ablations confirm the hop-count selector and the path prompt are complementary, jointly transforming KG evidence into more faithful answers.

Abstract: LLMs trained on web-scale data raise concerns about privacy and the right to be forgotten. To address these issues, Machine Unlearning provides techniques to remove specific information from trained models without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating unlearning in LLMs face two major limitations: they focus only on English and support only entity-level forgetting (removing all information about a person). We introduce FAME (Fictional Actors for Multilingual Erasure), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating Machine Unlearning across five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. FAME contains 1,000 fictional actor biographies and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Each biography includes information on 20 topics organized into structured categories (biography, career, achievements, personal information). This design enables both entity-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting entire identities) and instance-level unlearning (i.e., forgetting specific facts while retaining others). We provide two dataset splits to support these two different unlearning scenarios and enable systematic comparison of unlearning techniques across languages. Since FAME uses entirely fictional data, it ensures that the information was never encountered during model pretraining, allowing for a controlled evaluation of unlearning methods.

Motivation: 为解决澳大利亚在临床语言处理方面缺乏高质量、保护隐私且反映实际全科医疗实践的数据集的问题，特别是能够涵盖全科医生课程要求但现实中较少见的病例，以支持更广义的模型训练。

Method: 基于2022年RACGP课程指南和BEACH流行病学研究，生成500份合成病历。数据特意保留真实临床记录的特征，如简略表述、拼写错误、患者依从性差、社会经济障碍和医患分歧等复杂性。通过多方面的验证确保数据质量。

Result: 验证显示数据集在流行病学上与真实的澳大利亚全科就诊模式一致，具有高度的语言变异性和语义多样性。在下游医学概念抽取任务中展示了F1分数的提升，表明显著的数据集质量。

Conclusion: SynGP500填补了澳大利亚临床NLP研究的关键缺口，为开发评估澳大利亚全科医学的语言处理方法提供了一个既真实又保护患者隐私的资源，同时也可用于医学教育目的。

Abstract: We introduce SynGP500, a clinician-curated collection of 500 synthetic Australian general practice medical notes. The dataset integrates curriculum-based clinical breadth (RACGP 2022 Curriculum), epidemiologically-calibrated prevalence (BEACH study), and diverse consultation contexts. This approach systematically includes both common presentations and less-common curriculum-specified conditions that GPs must recognize but appear infrequently in single practice populations, potentially supporting more generalizable model training than datasets constrained by naturally occurring case distributions. SynGP500 is messy by design, reflecting the authentic complexity of healthcare delivery: telegraphic documentation, typos, patient non-adherence, socioeconomic barriers, and clinician-patient disagreements, unlike sanitized synthetic datasets that obscure clinical realities. Multi-faceted validation demonstrates dataset quality through epidemiological alignment with real Australian GP consultation patterns (BEACH study), stylometric analysis confirming high linguistic variation, semantic diversity analysis demonstrating broad coverage, and exploratory downstream evaluation using self-supervised medical concept extraction, showing F1 improvements. SynGP500 addresses a critical national gap, providing researchers and educators with a resource for developing and evaluating clinical NLP methods for Australian general practice while inherently protecting patient privacy.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种新的RLVR方法PPPO，专注于优化语言模型推理输出的前缀token，通过渐进式前缀保留和延续累积奖励策略，显著提升推理能力同时减少训练tokens。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有生成的token进行统一训练，忽略了前缀token在推理中的关键作用，导致训练效率低下。研究发现语言模型推理存在'起始锁定效应'，早期推理过程影响后续思考轨迹。

Method: 1) 提出PPPO方法，聚焦优化推理输出的前缀部分；2) 渐进式前缀保留：逐步增加训练中保留的前缀tokens比例；3) 延续累积奖励：为同一前缀采样多个延续序列，累积其得分作为奖励信号。

Result: 在各种推理任务上的实验表明，PPPO仅使用26.17%的训练tokens就超越了代表性RLVR方法，准确率提升18.02%。

Conclusion: 聚焦优化前缀推理过程的策略能更高效地提升语言模型的推理能力，验证了'起始锁定效应'的重要性，为RLVR方法提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current RLVR approaches typically conduct training across all generated tokens, but neglect to explore which tokens (e.g., prefix tokens) actually contribute to reasoning. This uniform training strategy spends substantial effort on optimizing low-return tokens, which in turn impedes the potential improvement from high-return tokens and reduces overall training effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a novel RLVR approach called Progressive Prefix-token Policy Optimization (PPPO), which highlights the significance of the prefix segment of generated outputs. Specifically, inspired by the well-established human thinking theory of Path Dependence, where early-stage thoughts substantially constrain subsequent thinking trajectory, we identify an analogous phenomenon in LLM reasoning termed Beginning Lock-in Effect (BLE). PPPO leverages this finding by focusing its optimization objective on the prefix reasoning process of LLMs. This targeted optimization strategy can positively influence subsequent reasoning processes, and ultimately improve final results. To improve the learning effectiveness of LLMs on how to start reasoning with high quality, PPPO introduces two training strategies: (a) Progressive Prefix Retention, which shapes a progressive learning process by increasing the proportion of retained prefix tokens during training; (b) Continuation Accumulated Reward, which mitigates reward bias by sampling multiple continuations for one prefix token sequence, and accumulating their scores as the reward signal. Extensive experimental results on various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our proposed PPPO outperforms representative RLVR methods, with the accuracy improvements of 18.02% on only 26.17% training tokens.

Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术主要处理通用人类价值或静态偏好，无法解决长期个性化和用户冷启动问题，需要开发能持续适应动态用户偏好的系统

Method: 通过将对话分解为单轮交互来构建统一用户档案，将偏好推断视为顺序决策任务，实现用户配置的动态完善

Result: 实验显示PersonalAgent在理想和嘈杂对话环境中均优于强提示和策略优化基线，保持跨会话偏好一致性，人工评估证实其能自然连贯地捕捉用户偏好

Conclusion: 终身个性化对于开发更具包容性和适应性的对话智能体至关重要，PersonalAgent在持续适应动态用户偏好方面表现出色

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive systems necessitates a deep alignment with the nuanced and dynamic preferences of individual users. Current alignment techniques predominantly address universal human values or static, single-turn preferences, thereby failing to address the critical needs of long-term personalization and the initial user cold-start problem. To bridge this gap, we propose PersonalAgent, a novel user-centric lifelong agent designed to continuously infer and adapt to user preferences. PersonalAgent constructs and dynamically refines a unified user profile by decomposing dialogues into single-turn interactions, framing preference inference as a sequential decision-making task. Experiments show that PersonalAgent achieves superior performance over strong prompt-based and policy optimization baselines, not only in idealized but also in noisy conversational contexts, while preserving cross-session preference consistency. Furthermore, human evaluation confirms that PersonalAgent excels at capturing user preferences naturally and coherently. Our findings underscore the importance of lifelong personalization for developing more inclusive and adaptive conversational agents. Our code is available here.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from zeolite synthesis experimental procedures is critical for materials discovery, yet existing methods have not systematically evaluated Large Language Models (LLMs) for this domain-specific task. This work addresses a fundamental question: what is the efficacy of different prompting strategies when applying LLMs to scientific information extraction? We focus on four key subtasks: event type classification (identifying synthesis steps), trigger text identification (locating event mentions), argument role extraction (recognizing parameter types), and argument text extraction (extracting parameter values). We evaluate four prompting strategies - zero-shot, few-shot, event-specific, and reflection-based - across six state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemma-3-12b-it, GPT-5-mini, O4-mini, Claude-Haiku-3.5, DeepSeek reasoning and non-reasoning) using the ZSEE dataset of 1,530 annotated sentences. Results demonstrate strong performance on event type classification (80-90\% F1) but modest performance on fine-grained extraction tasks, particularly argument role and argument text extraction (50-65\% F1). GPT-5-mini exhibits extreme prompt sensitivity with 11-79\% F1 variation. Notably, advanced prompting strategies provide minimal improvements over zero-shot approaches, revealing fundamental architectural limitations. Error analysis identifies systematic hallucination, over-generalization, and inability to capture synthesis-specific nuances. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs achieve high-level understanding, precise extraction of experimental parameters requires domain-adapted models, providing quantitative benchmarks for scientific information extraction.

Result: 获得指数值Δ=0.194，表明该领域存在极端主题分散性；计算语言学虽占主导但不是霸权力量，与社会语言学、语言教学等其他子学科共存。

Conclusion: 该研究阐明了Brookes'原始公式的正确应用方法，展示了其对学科特征分析的有效性，并为评估跨领域学科结构提供了可复制的文献计量方法。

Abstract: This study applies Brookes' Measure of Categorical Dispersion (Δ) to analyze the thematic structure of contemporary Arabic Applied Linguistics research. Using a comprehensive, real-world dataset of 1,564 publications from 2019 to 2025, classified into eight core sub-disciplines, we calculate a dispersion index of Δ = 0.194. This remarkably low value indicates extreme thematic dispersion, revealing that the field is characterized by pronounced heterogeneity rather than concentration. The analysis identifies Computational Linguistics as a dominant but non-hegemonic force, coexisting with robust research in Sociolinguistics, Language Teaching, and other subfields. This study clarifies the correct application of Brookes' original formula, demonstrates its utility for field characterization, and provides a replicable bibliometric methodology for assessing disciplinary structure across domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent evidence shows that the versification of prompts constitutes a highly effective adversarial mechanism against aligned LLMs. The study 'Adversarial poetry as a universal single-turn jailbreak mechanism in large language models' demonstrates that instructions routinely refused in prose become executable when rewritten as verse, producing up to 18 x more safety failures in benchmarks derived from MLCommons AILuminate. Manually written poems reach approximately 62% ASR, and automated versions 43%, with some models surpassing 90% success in single-turn interactions. The effect is structural: systems trained with RLHF, constitutional AI, and hybrid pipelines exhibit consistent degradation under minimal semiotic formal variation. Versification displaces the prompt into sparsely supervised latent regions, revealing guardrails that are excessively dependent on surface patterns. This dissociation between apparent robustness and real vulnerability exposes deep limitations in current alignment regimes. The absence of evaluations in Portuguese, a language with high morphosyntactic complexity, a rich metric-prosodic tradition, and over 250 million speakers, constitutes a critical gap. Experimental protocols must parameterise scansion, metre, and prosodic variation to test vulnerabilities specific to Lusophone patterns, which are currently ignored.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches employ uniform language density for both intermediate reasoning and final answers, leading to computational inefficiency. Our observation found that reasoning process serves a computational function for the model itself, while answering serves a communicative function for human understanding. This distinction enables the use of compressed, symbol-rich language for intermediate computations while maintaining human-readable final explanations. To address this inefficiency, we present Denser: \underline{D}ual-d\underline{ens}ity inf\underline{er}ence, a novel framework that optimizes information density separately for reasoning and answering phases. Our framework implements this through three components: a query processing module that analyzes input problems, a high-density compressed reasoning mechanism for efficient intermediate computations, and an answer generation component that translates compressed reasoning into human-readable solutions. Experimental evaluation across multiple reasoning question answering benchmarks demonstrates that Denser reduces token consumption by up to 62\% compared to standard Chain-of-Thought methods while preserving or improving accuracy. These efficiency gains are particularly significant for complex multi-step reasoning problems where traditional methods generate extensive explanations.

Abstract: ORACLE turns daily news into week-over-week, decision-ready insights for one of the Finnish University of Applied Sciences. The platform crawls and versions news, applies University-specific relevance filtering, embeds content, classifies items into PESTEL dimensions and builds a concise Time-Dependent Recursive Summary Graph (TRSG): two clustering layers summarized by an LLM and recomputed weekly. A lightweight change detector highlights what is new, removed or changed, then groups differences into themes for PESTEL-aware analysis. We detail the pipeline, discuss concrete design choices that make the system stable in production and present a curriculum-intelligence use case with an evaluation plan.

Abstract: Background: Motivational interviewing (MI) is an effective counseling approach for promoting health behavior change, but its impact is constrained by the need for highly trained human counselors. Objective: This study aimed to explore a scalable alternative by developing and evaluating Large Language Models for Motivational Interviewing (MI-LLMs). Methods: We first curated five Chinese psychological counseling corpora and, using GPT-4 with an MI-informed prompt, transcribed multi-turn dialogues from the two highest-quality datasets (CPsyCounD and PsyDTCorpus) into 2,040 MI-style counseling conversations, of which 2,000 were used for training and 40 for testing. Three Chinese-capable open-source LLMs (Baichuan2-7B-Chat, ChatGLM-4-9B-Chat and Llama-3-8B-Chinese-Chat-v2) were fine-tuned on this corpus and were named as MI-LLMs. We evaluated MI-LLMs using round-based automatic metrics and expert manual coding with the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) Coding Manual 4.2.1. Results: Across all three models, fine-tuning substantially improved BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores compared with the base models, and manual coding showed that MI-LLMs achieved technical and relational global scores, and MI-adherent ratios that approached those of real MI dialogues, although complex reflections and reflection-to-question ratios remained less frequent. Conclusions: These findings provide initial evidence that MI-oriented fine-tuning can endow general-purpose LLMs with core MI-consistent counseling behaviors, suggesting a scalable pathway toward AI-assisted health behavior change support while underscoring the need for further work on data scale, complex MI skills and real-world intervention trials.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis, an emerging research area within natural language processing (NLP), has primarily been explored in contexts like elections and social media trends, but there remains a significant gap in understanding emotional dynamics during civil unrest, particularly in the Bangla language. Our study pioneers sentiment analysis in Bangla during a national crisis by examining public emotions amid Bangladesh's 2024 mass uprising. We curated a unique dataset of 2,028 annotated news headlines from major Facebook news portals, classifying them into Outrage, Hope, and Despair. Through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified prevalent themes like political corruption and public protests, and analyzed how events such as internet blackouts shaped sentiment patterns. It outperformed multilingual transformers (mBERT: 67%, XLM-RoBERTa: 71%) and traditional machine learning methods (SVM and Logistic Regression: both 70%). These results highlight the effectiveness of language-specific models and offer valuable insights into public sentiment during political turmoil.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in long-context scenarios such as multi-turn conversations. However, long contexts pose significant challenges for inference efficiency, including high memory overhead from Key-Value (KV) cache and increased latency due to excessive memory accesses. Recent methods for dynamic KV selection struggle with trade-offs: block-level indexing degrades accuracy by retrieving irrelevant KV entries, while token-level indexing incurs high latency from inefficient retrieval mechanisms. In this paper, we propose CTKVR, a novel centroid-then-token KV retrieval scheme that addresses these limitations. CTKVR leverages a key observation: query vectors adjacent in position exhibit high similarity after Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and share most of their top-k KV cache entries. Based on this insight, CTKVR employs a two-stage retrieval strategy: lightweight centroids are precomputed during prefilling for centroid-grained indexing, followed by token-level refinement for precise KV retrieval. This approach balances retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance performance, we implement an optimized system for indexing construction and search using CPU-GPU co-execution. Experimentally, CTKVR achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% accuracy degradation. Meanwhile, CTKVR delivers 3 times and 4 times throughput speedups on Llama-3-8B and Yi-9B at 96K context length across diverse GPU hardware.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The concept of inflection classes is an abstraction used by linguists, and provides a means to describe patterns in languages that give an analogical base for deducing previously unencountered forms. This ability is an important part of morphological acquisition and processing. We study the learnability of a system of verbal inflection classes by the individual language user by performing unsupervised clustering of lexemes into inflection classes. As a cognitively plausible and interpretable computational model, we use Adaptive Resonance Theory, a neural network with a parameter that determines the degree of generalisation (vigilance). The model is applied to Latin, Portuguese and Estonian. The similarity of clustering to attested inflection classes varies depending on the complexity of the inflectional system. We find the best performance in a narrow region of the generalisation parameter. The learned features extracted from the model show similarity with linguistic descriptions of the inflection classes. The proposed model could be used to study change in inflection classes in the future, by including it in an agent-based model.

Abstract: Traditional linguists have proposed the use of a General Service List (GSL) to assist new language learners in identifying the most important words in English. This process requires linguistic expertise, subjective input, and a considerable amount of time. We attempt to create our own GSL and evaluate its practicality against the industry standard (The NGSL). We found creating a Specialized Word List (SWL), or a word list specific to a subset of the overall corpus, to be the most practical way for language-learners to optimize the process. The SWL's that we created using our model outperformed the industry standard, reaching the 95% coverage required for language comprehension with fewer words comparatively. By restricting the SWL process to objective criteria only, it can be automated, scaled, and tailored to the needs of language-learners across the globe.

Motivation: 虽然针对西方语言（特别是英语）的多词表达式研究已取得显著进展，但中文等表意文字在这方面仍落后。现有子词建模方法（如BPE）不适用于中文这类表意文字系统，因此需要探索汉字分解技术来解决中文MWE翻译难题。

Abstract: Word meaning, representation, and interpretation play fundamental roles in natural language understanding (NLU), natural language processing (NLP), and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Many of the inherent difficulties in these tasks stem from Multi-word Expressions (MWEs), which complicate the tasks by introducing ambiguity, idiomatic expressions, infrequent usage, and a wide range of variations. Significant effort and substantial progress have been made in addressing the challenging nature of MWEs in Western languages, particularly English. This progress is attributed in part to the well-established research communities and the abundant availability of computational resources. However, the same level of progress is not true for language families such as Chinese and closely related Asian languages, which continue to lag behind in this regard. While sub-word modelling has been successfully applied to many Western languages to address rare words improving phrase comprehension, and enhancing machine translation (MT) through techniques like byte-pair encoding (BPE), it cannot be applied directly to ideograph language scripts like Chinese. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the Chinese character decomposition technology in the context of MWE-aware neural machine translation (NMT). Furthermore, we report experiments to examine how Chinese character decomposition technology contributes to the representation of the original meanings of Chinese words and characters, and how it can effectively address the challenges of translating MWEs.

Motivation: 传统基于子词标记化的语言模型存在字符理解不足和固定词汇表带来的效率限制问题；现有字节级模型主要从头开始训练，性能不如子词模型。研究旨在开发一个既能克服子词限制，又能保持子词模型性能的实用字节级模型。

Method: 提出字节化方法：通过定制架构解决字节级和子词级模型表达性不匹配问题，利用精确蒸馏目标将现有子词模型转换为字节级模型。模型设计支持高标记压缩比以提升推理速度，并可利用现有生态系统进行廉价高效的后期训练。

Result: Bolmo全面超越同规模字节级模型，在字符理解和部分编程任务上优于源子词模型，在其他任务上接近原模型性能。能以不到预训练成本1%的代价实现转换，达到与子词模型竞争的推理速度。

Conclusion: 字节化方法成功克服了字节级模型的实用化障碍，使字节级语言模型首次成为在各种用例中与子词模型竞争的实用选择，为克服子词标记化局限性提供了有效路径。

Abstract: We introduce Bolmo, the first family of competitive fully open byte-level language models (LMs) at the 1B and 7B parameter scales. In contrast to prior research on byte-level LMs, which focuses predominantly on training from scratch, we train Bolmo by byteifying existing subword-level LMs. Byteification enables overcoming the limitations of subword tokenization - such as insufficient character understanding and efficiency constraints due to the fixed subword vocabulary - while performing at the level of leading subword-level LMs. Bolmo is specifically designed for byteification: our architecture resolves a mismatch between the expressivity of prior byte-level architectures and subword-level LMs, which makes it possible to employ an effective exact distillation objective between Bolmo and the source subword model. This allows for converting a subword-level LM to a byte-level LM by investing less than 1\% of a typical pretraining token budget. Bolmo substantially outperforms all prior byte-level LMs of comparable size, and outperforms the source subword-level LMs on character understanding and, in some cases, coding, while coming close to matching the original LMs' performance on other tasks. Furthermore, we show that Bolmo can achieve inference speeds competitive with subword-level LMs by training with higher token compression ratios, and can be cheaply and effectively post-trained by leveraging the existing ecosystem around the source subword-level LM. Our results finally make byte-level LMs a practical choice competitive with subword-level LMs across a wide set of use cases.

Conclusion: PsyDefConv语料库和DMRS Co-Pilot为语言中的心理防御功能研究提供了有价值资源。虽然当前模型的识别性能仍有提升空间，但该系统显著提高了标注效率并为研究临床对话中的防御机制分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Psychological defenses are strategies, often automatic, that people use to manage distress. Rigid or overuse of defenses is negatively linked to mental health and shapes what speakers disclose and how they accept or resist help. However, defenses are complex and difficult to reliably measure, particularly in clinical dialogues. We introduce PsyDefConv, a dialogue corpus with help seeker utterances labeled for defense level, and DMRS Co-Pilot, a four-stage pipeline that provides evidence-based pre-annotations. The corpus contains 200 dialogues and 4709 utterances, including 2336 help seeker turns, with labeling and Cohen's kappa 0.639. In a counterbalanced study, the co-pilot reduced average annotation time by 22.4%. In expert review, it averaged 4.62 for evidence, 4.44 for clinical plausibility, and 4.40 for insight on a seven-point scale. Benchmarks with strong language models in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings demonstrate clear headroom, with the best macro F1-score around 30% and a tendency to overpredict mature defenses. Corpus analyses confirm that mature defenses are most common and reveal emotion-specific deviations. We will release the corpus, annotations, code, and prompts to support research on defensive functioning in language.

### [106] [Evaluating Metrics for Safety with LLM-as-Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15617)
*Kester Clegg,Richard Hawkins,Ibrahim Habli,Tom Lawton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张通过建立证据导向的评估框架来安全地将LLM引入关键信息流，核心是利用多指标加权评估、上下文敏感性和置信度阈值来降低风险，而非依赖确定性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在文本处理流程中的广泛应用，它们可能替代因人力不足或流程复杂而成为瓶颈的关键人工角色，但LLM的错误可能导致严重后果（如医疗分诊、核设施访问调度）。因此，需要一种可靠的方法将LLM安全集成到关键信息流中。

Method: 提出以评估证据为核心的安全论证框架：1）采用一组加权指标（而非单一确定性评估）；2）利用上下文敏感性定义错误严重性；3）设计置信度阈值，当评估者间一致性较低时触发人工审查（特别是在LLM-as-Judge评估场景中）。

Result: 理论框架表明，通过多指标加权评估、上下文敏感分级和置信度触发机制，可以系统降低LLM在关键任务中的错误风险，并为需要人工介入的临界情况提供明确标准。

Conclusion: 在安全关键领域部署LLM时，应放弃追求确定性评估的幻想，转而构建基于多源证据、风险分级和人工复核的弹性安全框架，从而在允许自动化效益的同时管控剩余风险。

Abstract: LLMs (Large Language Models) are increasingly used in text processing pipelines to intelligently respond to a variety of inputs and generation tasks. This raises the possibility of replacing human roles that bottleneck existing information flows, either due to insufficient staff or process complexity. However, LLMs make mistakes and some processing roles are safety critical. For example, triaging post-operative care to patients based on hospital referral letters, or updating site access schedules in nuclear facilities for work crews. If we want to introduce LLMs into critical information flows that were previously performed by humans, how can we make them safe and reliable? Rather than make performative claims about augmented generation frameworks or graph-based techniques, this paper argues that the safety argument should focus on the type of evidence we get from evaluation points in LLM processes, particularly in frameworks that employ LLM-as-Judges (LaJ) evaluators. This paper argues that although we cannot get deterministic evaluations from many natural language processing tasks, by adopting a basket of weighted metrics it may be possible to lower the risk of errors within an evaluation, use context sensitivity to define error severity and design confidence thresholds that trigger human review of critical LaJ judgments when concordance across evaluators is low.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的下游任务适应主要通过微调实现，但参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）的配置影响在问答任务和泛化能力方面缺乏深入研究。

Method: 在多个推理和召回数据集上进行全面评估，执行秩扫描实验量化SFT与PEFT的权衡，并通过谱特征和注意力结构分析内部表示。

Result: LoRA在推理任务中特定秩值下达到竞争性甚至优于SFT的性能；发现域内和域外适应中的泛化行为差异及任务特异性遗忘。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调方法在保持计算效率的同时，能够在特定配置下达到媲美全监督微调的性能，为其实际应用提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. Full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), are two dominant approaches. While PEFT methods are widely used for their computational efficiency, the implications of their configurations (e.g., rank) remain under-explored in downstream Q&A tasks and generalisation. In this work, we perform a comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning and recall datasets, conducting a rank sweep to quantify the trade-off between SFT and PEFT. We also compare the accuracy of PEFT and SFT models across in-domain and out-of-domain adaptation, highlighting distinct generalisation behaviour and task-specific forgetting. We demonstrate that LoRA achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to SFT, particularly on reasoning tasks at specific rank values. Additionally, we analyze the internal representations via spectral features and layer-wise attention structures, offering insights into representational drift and structural changes in attention patterns.

Abstract: Continual learning remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, requiring models to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A major obstacle in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where performance on earlier tasks degrades as new tasks are learned. In this paper, we introduce PPSEBM, a novel framework that integrates an Energy-Based Model (EBM) with Progressive Parameter Selection (PPS) to effectively address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for natural language processing tasks. In PPSEBM, progressive parameter selection allocates distinct, task-specific parameters for each new task, while the EBM generates representative pseudo-samples from prior tasks. These generated samples actively inform and guide the parameter selection process, enhancing the model's ability to retain past knowledge while adapting to new tasks. Experimental results on diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that PPSEBM outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods, offering a promising and robust solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了一种称为LatentQA的简化方法训练出的激活预言模型，在多样化训练和远分布设置下的表现，发现即使窄训练也能良好泛化，多样化训练可进一步提升性能，在多项任务上达到或超过白盒基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的激活通常难以理解，现有技术多采用复杂专业方法。近期提出的LatentQA方法让LLM直接接受激活作为输入并用自然语言回答相关问题，但先前研究集中在窄任务设置上。本文希望从通用视角探索该方法在分布外设置下的能力及训练数据多样性的影响。

Method: 训练LatentQA模型（称为激活预言模型），评估其在远分布设置下的表现，研究训练数据多样性（如分类任务、自监督上下文预测任务）对性能的影响，并与先前的白盒和黑盒技术进行比较。

Result: 激活预言模型能够恢复微调到模型中但未出现在输入文本中的信息（如传记知识或恶意倾向），即使从未使用微调模型的激活进行训练。在四个下游任务中，窄训练的LatentQA模型表现出良好的泛化能力，增加训练数据集带来一致的进一步改进。最佳激活预言模型在所有四个任务上达到或超过先前的白盒基线，在3/4任务上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多样化训练使模型具备将LLM激活的信息用自然语言表达的一般能力，为理解LLM内部表示提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) activations are notoriously difficult to understand, with most existing techniques using complex, specialized methods for interpreting them. Recent work has proposed a simpler approach known as LatentQA: training LLMs to directly accept LLM activations as inputs and answer arbitrary questions about them in natural language. However, prior work has focused on narrow task settings for both training and evaluation. In this paper, we instead take a generalist perspective. We evaluate LatentQA-trained models, which we call Activation Oracles (AOs), in far out-of-distribution settings and examine how performance scales with training data diversity. We find that AOs can recover information fine-tuned into a model (e.g., biographical knowledge or malign propensities) that does not appear in the input text, despite never being trained with activations from a fine-tuned model. Our main evaluations are four downstream tasks where we can compare to prior white- and black-box techniques. We find that even narrowly-trained LatentQA models can generalize well, and that adding additional training datasets (such as classification tasks and a self-supervised context prediction task) yields consistent further improvements. Overall, our best AOs match or exceed prior white-box baselines on all four tasks and are the best method on 3 out of 4. These results suggest that diversified training to answer natural-language queries imparts a general capability to verbalize information about LLM activations.

Abstract: Gamification is widely used in digital learning. However, most systems neglect age-related differences. This paper investigates how gamification can be designed in an age-aware way to address learners' diverse motivational and cognitive needs. Based on a targeted literature review, we present a mapping of age groups, mechanics, and effects. Furthermore, we derive five design principles for age-specific gamification and identify three technical patterns for implementation in multimedia learning environments. The results indicate that gamification is not universally effective, but rather requires a differentiated design to support engagement and inclusivity across the lifespan.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI生态系统中的多样性如何影响模型性能衰减（知识崩溃问题），发现适度的模型多样性可以缓解崩溃，但过多或过少的多样性都会损害性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的广泛应用，人们担忧会导致'知识崩溃'，即思想趋于单一化、集中于最主流的观点。已有研究表明单个模型在自我训练时会出现性能衰减。本研究受生态学启发，探索多模型生态系统的多样性是否能够缓解这种崩溃现象。

Method: 在单模型方法基础上，构建了在集体输出上进行训练的模型生态系统。通过将训练数据分割给不同语言模型，创建具有不同多样性的系统，然后在10次自我训练迭代中评估性能表现。

Result: 研究发现认知多样性增加确实能缓解模型崩溃，但这种效果存在最优水平。仅有几个不同模型的生态系统无法充分表达真实分布的丰富性，导致性能快速衰减。而将数据分给过多模型则会降低每个模型对真实分布的逼近能力，导致从第一次迭代就表现不佳。

Conclusion: 在AI文化单一化的背景下，研究结果表明需要监控AI系统间的多样性，并制定政策激励更多针对特定领域和社区的模型开发，以维持健康的AI生态系统。

Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

Motivation: 在多源域自适应中，源域常包含冗余或无关信息，尤其是在大规模源域设置下会影响迁移性能，需要开发有效策略来选择最具可迁移性的知识。

Method: 1. 使用密度驱动选择策略在训练过程中选择源样本并确定哪些源模型应参与目标预测；2. 基于预训练多模态模型的伪标签增强模块减轻目标域标签噪声并改进自监督。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明该方法具有优越性。

Conclusion: AutoS方法能够有效选择相关的可迁移源知识，提升多域自适应性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

Conclusion: GPT-OSS的架构创新和训练策略使小型模型能够在金融应用中实现与大型模型相近的性能，同时大幅降低计算开销，为可持续且经济高效的LLM部署提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.

Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.

In this paper, we improve this approach by applying Hierarchical Attention Transformers (HATs) to solve systems of multivariate polynomial equations via Groebner bases computation. The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

Abstract: Urban wind flow modeling and simulation play an important role in air quality assessment and sustainable city planning. A key challenge for modeling and simulation is handling the complex geometries of the urban landscape. Low order models are limited in capturing the effects of geometry, while high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are prohibitively expensive, especially across multiple geometries or wind conditions. Here, we propose a generative diffusion framework for synthesizing steady-state urban wind fields over unstructured meshes that requires only geometry information. The framework combines a hierarchical graph neural network with score-based diffusion modeling to generate accurate and diverse velocity fields without requiring temporal rollouts or dense measurements. Trained across multiple mesh slices and wind angles, the model generalizes to unseen geometries, recovers key flow structures such as wakes and recirculation zones, and offers uncertainty-aware predictions. Ablation studies confirm robustness to mesh variation and performance under different inference regimes. This work develops is the first step towards foundation models for the built environment that can help urban planners rapidly evaluate design decisions under densification and climate uncertainty.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.

Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何框架，用于政策约束的语义解释，可证明防止高风险领域中的幻觉承诺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融等高风险的决策场景中，AI系统可能会产生幻觉（hallucinated commitments），即模型生成超出证据或违反政策的承诺。这可能导致严重的后果。因此，需要一种可证明防止幻觉的语义解释框架。

Method: 该框架将语义表示为单位球面上的方向，证据建模为见证向量集，可接受的解释对应球面凸区域。政策约束作为定义在同一流形上的显式先验引入，并与证据几何分离。解释被转化为对可接受区域进行约束优化，在矛盾或政策排除时，拒绝成为一个拓扑上必然的结果。该框架还与信息论、贝叶斯推理和层论语义建立了理论联系。

Result: 理论证明该框架的复杂度边界是信息论最优的。在受监管的大规模金融数据上进行实证验证，结果显示：在多种政策制度下，幻觉批准为零。这是首次实现如此大规模下零幻觉的结果。

Conclusion: 所提出的几何框架通过将证据与政策约束在几何层面分离，提供了可证明防止幻觉承诺的语义解释方法。理论证明信息论最优，并在大规模金融应用中验证了有效性。这为高风险领域的AI系统提供了可靠的承诺管理方案。

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.

Method: 提出模型无关的轻量级方法，在推理时选择性覆盖过时的用户特征，注入近期观看历史，无需模型重新训练即可实现日内个性化

Result: 将个性化反馈循环从每日缩短至日内，显著提升用户参与度0.47%，这是视频流媒体服务中首次证明日内个性化能产生实质性影响的证据

Conclusion: 该方法为长视频流媒体提供了一种有效的日内个性化方案，避免了完全实时架构所需的模型重训练，平衡了效率与时效性

Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

Motivation: 传统天气预报评估主要关注预测准确性统计，忽视了预测的实际决策价值。现实中预测用于支持决策，需要从决策者角度评估预测对决策质量的提升作用。

Method: 引入决策校准框架，在天气相关决策任务中评估机器学习和经典数值天气预报模型。该框架将预测评估从预测层面提升到决策层面，量化预测对具体决策任务的实际价值。

Result: 发现模型在预测层面的性能表现不能可靠地转化为下游决策效能，某些模型差异只在决策层面才显现，且不同决策任务中的模型排名会发生变化。

Conclusion: 传统预测评估方法不足以为特定决策任务选择最优预测模型，需要引入决策层面的评估框架来真正反映预测的实用价值。

Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自引用学习（模型在自身生成的数据上训练）虽具有无限扩展潜力，但普遍存在模型崩溃问题（如语言模型退化、GAN模式丢失、强化学习策略过度利用）。实践中的各种修复方法缺乏统一的理论解释

Method: 提出熵水库Bregman投影(ERBP)框架，将封闭循环建模为分布空间中的随机Bregman投影序列。通过引入熵水库（将高熵分布混合到每次投影中），注入可控的熵通量以稳定动力学

Result: 理论上得出：(1)模型崩溃的必要条件；(2)保障非平凡熵底限的充分条件；(3)仅依赖于样本量和Bregman生成器强凸性/Lipschitz常数的闭式收敛率。在大型语言模型自训练、强化学习Soft Actor-Critic和GAN优化中验证了预测

Conclusion: ERBP将各种经验修复方法统一为量化的设计规则：监控和预算熵通量，为自引用学习的稳定提供理论指导

Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

Motivation: 在线学习能增量更新模型，无需大规模存储和昂贵的重新计算，但现有方法在处理数据漂移和置信度变化时存在局限，需要更通用且稳健的在线回归模型。

Method: 提出OLR-WA（在线回归加权平均）模型，采用加权平均策略进行增量更新，优先考虑置信度较高的旧数据点，以保守方式处理数据漂移和置信度变化。

Result: OLR-WA性能接近批量回归，优于其他在线模型，收敛速度快（从第一次迭代就获得高R²），即使仅用1%-10%数据初始化也能保持稳定，且是唯一能有效处理置信度挑战场景的模型。

Conclusion: OLR-WA在不同场景下表现出通用性和实用性，是在线线性回归任务的优秀解决方案。

Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.

Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.

The proposed method is validated through simulations, showing significant gains over commonly used methods.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散模型难以生成满足约束条件的样本，这在科学应用中很常见。现有方法通过损失正则或采样引导来强制执行约束，但这些方法会使生成模型偏离真实数据分布，特别是在约束条件被错误指定时。

Method: 不像传统方法那样改变损失函数或采样循环，本文提出将引导式调整集成到去噪器本身，赋予其一种软性的归纳偏差，倾向于产生符合约束的样本。

Result: 研究表明，这种软约束去噪器能够利用约束知识提高合规性，同时在约束与观测数据存在错误指定时保持足够的灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过在去噪器中嵌入软约束机制，可以更好地平衡约束合规性和数据分布保真度，特别适用于约束条件可能被错误指定的科学应用场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

TL;DR: SPA是一个确定性框架，用于提取价格趋势、关联公开事件并生成解释性叙述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术指标和预测模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，难以满足审计需求。

Method: 使用每日OHLCV数据和标准化事件流，通过确定性分割、事件对齐和约束解释来提取单调价格运行。

Result: 在AAPL、NVDA、SCHW、PGR等股票上验证了SPA能稳定生成结构分解和上下文叙述。

Conclusion: SPA不用于预测或交易信号，而是为分析师工作流和可解释AI提供透明、可复现的历史价格结构分析。

Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness. These results demonstrate that combining signature transforms with attention-based architectures provides an effective and scalable framework for parameter inference in stochastic systems with rough or persistent temporal structure.

Motivation: 现有的Transformer和扩散模型缺乏显式的归纳偏置和频率感知能力，限制了它们在结构化缺失模式和分布偏移下的泛化性能。

Method: FADTI通过可学习的傅里叶偏置投影（FBP）模块注入频率感知的特征调制，该模块支持多种频谱基，可自适应编码平稳和非平稳模式，并与自注意力和门控卷积结合进行时序建模。

Conclusion: FADTI通过注入频率域归纳偏置到生成式插值过程中，有效提升了多元时间序列插值的性能，特别是在具有挑战性的缺失模式下。

Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

TL;DR: 研究对比了XGBoost、随机森林等树模型与LSTM、TCN等深度学习方法在德国农业产量预测中的表现，发现虽然模型在传统测试集上表现良好，但在时间独立验证中性能显著下降，且不佳的泛化能力仍可能产生看似可信的SHAP解释，揭示了可解释性方法的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在评估机器学习模型在农业环境系统中的泛化性能，特别关注模型解释的可信度问题，因为即使模型泛化能力差，仍可能产生看似合理的特征重要性分析，这在数据驱动的农业应用中构成潜在风险。

Method: 使用德国NUTS-3地区的长期高质量数据集，系统比较了集成树模型（XGBoost、随机森林）与深度学习模型（LSTM、TCN），既进行空间分割的常规测试，也进行时间独立的验证，并利用SHAP方法分析特征重要性。

Result: 所有模型在传统测试集上表现良好，但在时间独立验证年上性能显著下降，表明泛化能力有限；同时，即使模型在时间验证中表现不佳，仍能产生看似合理的SHAP特征重要性值，暴露了后验可解释性方法的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 提出在农业和环境系统中需要进行验证感知的模型解释，特征重要性不能轻易采信，除非模型已明确证明能泛化到未见的时间和空间条件。倡导领域感知的验证、混合建模策略，以及对可解释性方法进行更严格的审查，以应对环境数据科学中的泛化信任挑战。

Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

Conclusion: 多轮联邦学习增加了推断攻击的脆弱性，聚合器比数据所有者构成更大威胁。数据集特性显著影响攻击效果，高维数据泄露风险更高。这些发现强调了联邦学习隐私保护需要更全面的考虑。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.

Method: 提出统一理论框架，将INR组件分解为成对相似性因子和比例项，推导常见组件的封闭形式方差分解公式，分析位置编码、球面归一化、Hadamard调制等机制对NTK特征值方差的影响。

Result: 实验证实理论预测的方差降低效果，多种任务中INR架构通过改进NTK条件化实现更快收敛、更高重建质量。

Conclusion: 通过NTK特征值方差分解的视角，为INR架构设计提供理论指导，阐明不同机制如何协同改善频谱偏差问题。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.

Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了后训练量化(PTQ)中的隐私-效用关系。通过成员推理攻击评估，发现低精度PTQ能减少隐私泄露，特别是4位、2位和1.58位量化可显著降低成员推理脆弱性，但会牺牲一定效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐私分析主要关注全精度模型，但量化技术已广泛应用来降低内存和计算成本。量化会改变模型参数和输出，因此需要理解位数减少如何影响隐私泄露，填补这一研究空白。

Method: 使用成员推理攻击作为评估框架，分析三种流行的PTQ算法(AdaRound、BRECQ、OBC)在多种精度级别(4位、2位、1.58位)下对CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集的影响。

Result: 低精度PTQ能减少隐私泄露，较低精度模型相比全精度对应模型，成员推理脆弱性降低了多达一个数量级。额外消融研究表明，仅对最后一层采用更高精度量化可实现细粒度隐私-效用权衡控制。

Conclusion: PTQ可在不重新训练的情况下应用于预训练模型，提供实际操作见解，帮助实践者在实际部署中平衡效率、效用和隐私保护。低精度量化提供了一种有前景的方法来增强模型隐私性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are widely deployed with quantization techniques to reduce memory and computational costs by lowering the numerical precision of their parameters. While quantization alters model parameters and their outputs, existing privacy analyses primarily focus on full-precision models, leaving a gap in understanding how bit-width reduction can affect privacy leakage. We present the first systematic study of the privacy-utility relationship in post-training quantization (PTQ), a versatile family of methods that can be applied to pretrained models without further training. Using membership inference attacks as our evaluation framework, we analyze three popular PTQ algorithms-AdaRound, BRECQ, and OBC-across multiple precision levels (4-bit, 2-bit, and 1.58-bit) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets. Our findings consistently show that low-precision PTQs can reduce privacy leakage. In particular, lower-precision models demonstrate up to an order of magnitude reduction in membership inference vulnerability compared to their full-precision counterparts, albeit at the cost of decreased utility. Additional ablation studies on the 1.58-bit quantization level show that quantizing only the last layer at higher precision enables fine-grained control over the privacy-utility trade-off. These results offer actionable insights for practitioners to balance efficiency, utility, and privacy protection in real-world deployments.

TL;DR: 提出两种相位感知预处理策略来处理多轴振动数据中的随机相位变化，评估六种深度学习架构，证明相位对齐能显著提升预测性维护系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的旋转机械预测性维护方法大多在频谱特征提取时丢弃相位信息，或使用原始时域波形而未显式利用相位信息，这限制了性能提升空间。

Method: 提出两种相位感知预处理策略：1）三轴独立相位调整，将每个轴独立对齐到零相位；2）单轴参考相位调整，通过统一时间偏移保持轴间相位关系。使用新构建的同步三轴传感器转子数据集，在两级学习框架下评估六种深度学习架构。

Result: 三种轴独立方法实现一致性能提升（如Transformer提升2.7%），单轴参考方法通过保持空间相位关系达到96.2%准确率（提升5.4%），所有深度学习架构均有独立改进。

Conclusion: 两种相位对齐策略均为预测性维护系统提供了实用且可扩展的性能增强方案，显式利用相位信息能有效提升振动信号的分析效果。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同表示方法能捕获互补的结构信息，选择性融合这些表示可以在特定类型的数据集上超越现有最优方法Rocket。

Method: 通过元特征将UCR数据集聚类为六个可解释的数据结构机制，构建F3轻量级框架自适应融合三种表示，结合非参数配对统计、消融研究和SHAP归因分析验证效果。

Result: 在113个UCR数据集上，F3在具有结构化变异性或丰富频率内容的机制中表现优于基线，而在高度不规则或异常值多的设置中收益递减，总体取得了小幅但一致的改进。

Conclusion: 选择性融合为强大的核方法提供了可靠且可解释的扩展，能在数据支持的情况下精确纠正其弱点。

Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个系统性评估电力系统保护中机器学习模型鲁棒性的统一框架，通过高保真电磁暂态仿真模拟传感器数据降级场景，发现故障分类相对稳定而故障定位对电压数据丢失更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源和分布式发电渗透率的提高，传统依赖固定设置和本地测量的保护方案面临挑战。机器学习为集中式故障分类和故障定位提供了数据驱动的替代方案，但实际部署需要保证在传感器数据缺失、噪声或降级情况下的鲁棒性。

Method: 本研究引入一个统一的框架系统性评估电力系统保护中机器学习模型的鲁棒性。使用高保真电磁暂态仿真模拟现实的数据降级场景，包括传感器中断、采样率降低和瞬态通信丢失。该框架提供了标准化的模型基准测试方法，量化有限可观测性的影响，并识别实现弹性运行所需的关键测量通道。

Result: 结果显示故障分类在大多数数据降级类型下保持高度稳定，但在单相数据丢失时性能下降约13%。故障定位整体更加敏感，电压数据丢失会将定位误差增加超过150%。

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来机器学习辅助保护系统的鲁棒性设计提供了实用指导。该框架有助于评估保护算法在传感器数据缺失或降级情况下的可靠性，为构建更具适应性的电力系统保护方案奠定基础。

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体在面对探索与利用的困境时缺乏系统性的指导方法，认知不确定性反映了知识不足导致的系统不确定性，需要开发能有效利用此类信息进行原则性探索的算法。

Method: 提出了EUBRL算法——一种贝叶斯强化学习方法，利用认知不确定性作为引导机制，自适应地减少由估计误差带来的每一步遗憾。

Result: 在无限视界折扣MDP中，对一类足够具有表达力的先验建立了接近极小极大最优的遗憾界和样本复杂度保证；在稀疏奖励、长视界和随机性任务上的实证研究表明，EUBRL在样本效率、可扩展性和一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 基于认知不确定性的贝叶斯强化学习框架EUBRL能够有效指导智能体在未知环境中的探索，通过自适应减少估计误差实现原则性探索，在理论和实际性能上均表现出色。

Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.

Motivation: 现有基于流的任意到任意生成方法存在效率问题，需要大规模配对数据集、高计算成本建模联合分布，以及复杂的多阶段训练。

Method: FlowBind学习共享潜在空间捕捉跨模态信息，使用特定模态的可逆流将潜在空间与各模态连接，通过单一流匹配目标联合优化，推理时直接作为编码器/解码器进行跨模态转换。

Result: 在文本、图像和音频实验中，FlowBind达到可比质量，同时参数减少6倍，训练速度快10倍。

Conclusion: FlowBind通过共享潜在空间和可逆流实现了高效的任意到任意生成，显著减少了数据需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) evolve along distinct paths but converge in the design of Dyna-Q [1]. However, modern RL methods still struggle with effective transferability across tasks and scenarios. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a generalized algorithm, Feature Model-Based Enhanced Actor-Critic (FM-EAC), that integrates planning, acting, and learning for multi-task control in dynamic environments. FM-EAC combines the strengths of MBRL and MFRL and improves generalizability through the use of novel feature-based models and an enhanced actor-critic framework. Simulations in both urban and agricultural applications demonstrate that FM-EAC consistently outperforms many state-of-the-art MBRL and MFRL methods. More importantly, different sub-networks can be customized within FM-EAC according to user-specific requirements.

TL;DR: 针对MBRL中rollout长度选择的两个困境（分布偏移与梯度估计稳定性），提出DHMBPO方法，通过长分布rollout生成在线样本缓解分布偏移，短训练rollout实现稳定的梯度估计，平衡模型偏差与梯度不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBRL中，长rollout能更好地保持在线训练但会放大模型偏差，同时长rollout会降低值估计偏差但增加策略梯度方差，这两个最优长度可能存在冲突，需要一种方法来平衡分布偏移、模型偏差和梯度不稳定性。

Method: 提出DHMBPO方法，将rollout过程分为长的"分布rollout"（DR）生成在线状态样本以缓解分布偏移，以及短的"训练rollout"（TR）利用可微分转移提供准确的值梯度估计和稳定的梯度更新。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，DHMBPO在样本效率和运行时方面均超越了现有的MBRL方法，有效平衡了分布偏移、模型偏差和梯度不稳定性。

Conclusion: 双长度rollout方法通过分离分布rollout和训练rollout，成功解决了MBRL中rollout长度选择的困境，为平衡模型偏差、分布偏移和梯度稳定性提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.

Abstract: Large scale text-to-image generation models can memorize and reproduce their training dataset. Since the training dataset often contains copyrighted material, reproduction of training dataset poses a copyright infringement risk, which could result in legal liabilities and financial losses for both the AI user and the developer. The current works explores the potential of chain-of-thought and task instruction prompting in reducing copyrighted content generation. To this end, we present a formulation that combines these two techniques with two other copyright mitigation strategies: a) negative prompting, and b) prompt re-writing. We study the generated images in terms their similarity to a copyrighted image and their relevance of the user input. We present numerical experiments on a variety of models and provide insights on the effectiveness of the aforementioned techniques for varying model complexity.

Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

Motivation: 现有的分类器个体预测可靠性评估主要使用鲁棒性量化(RQ)和不确定性量化(UQ)两种不同概念的方法，但缺乏对两者的系统性比较和组合研究。

Method: 在多个基准数据集上对比RQ和UQ方法，评估它们的表现，并探索将两者结合为混合方法的可能性。

Abstract: We consider two conceptually different approaches for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a classifier: Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We compare both approaches on a number of benchmark datasets and show that there is no clear winner between the two, but that they are complementary and can be combined to obtain a hybrid approach that outperforms both RQ and UQ. As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.

Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Motivation: 当前基于图消息传递的机制（如GATs或Transformers）在性能上取得突破，但仍存在计算效率与性能的权衡。为进一步提升，需要探索超越成对token交互的高阶注意力机制。

Method: 1. 引入N-simplicial注意力，将Rotary Position Embeddings适应于高阶交互 2. 提出成本有效的单纯形选择策略，使模型能集中计算资源于任务敏感的高阶交互 3. 通过推导Lipschitz上界来研究N-simplicial注意力的平滑性

Result: 研究发现N-simplicial注意力虽然开启了高阶交互的消息传递，但其本身也存在过度平滑问题，这为后续优化提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 该工作为高阶注意力机制提供了理论框架和实用方法，通过单纯形选择策略平衡了计算复杂度和性能，同时揭示了高阶交互中仍存在的平滑性挑战。

Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合注意力是重要的社交技能，自闭症儿童常在此方面存在障碍，影响社交沟通。现有研究在沉浸技术应用和设备干扰方面存在不足，因此需要开发更有效的训练平台。

Method: 开发了基于AR和VR的联合注意力训练平台，采用眼动追踪交互以确保专注。对自闭症组(19人)和神经典型组(13人)进行实验，量化分析包括正确反应数、建立眼神接触时间、响应时间等指标，并与CARS评分和年龄进行相关性分析。

Result: AR实验中神经典型组响应时间显著快于自闭症组(p<0.00001)。自闭症组响应时间与CARS评分呈正相关(ρ=0.57, p=0.03)。AR平台的正确率(92.30%)高于VR(69.49%)。VR实验也观察到相似趋势。

Conclusion: 沉浸技术可用于自闭症儿童的联合注意力训练，AR比VR更有效。未来研究应探索长期效益和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Joint Attention (JA), a crucial social skill for developing shared focus, is often impaired in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), affecting social communication and highlighting the need for early intervention. Addressing gaps in prior research, such as limited use of immersive technology and reliance on distracting peripherals, we developed a novel JA training platform using Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) devices. The platform integrates eye gaze-based interactions to ensure participants undivided attention. To validate the platform, we conducted experiments on ASD (N=19) and Neurotypical (NT) (N=13) participants under a trained pediatric neurologist's supervision. For quantitative analysis, we employed key measures such as the number of correct responses, the duration of establishing eye contact (s), and the duration of registering a response (s), along with correlations to CARS scores and age. Results from AR-based experiments showed NT participants registered responses significantly faster (<0.00001) than ASD participants. A correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.57, p=0.03) was found between ASD participants response time and CARS scores. A similar trend was observed in VR-based experiments. When comparing response accuracy in ASD participants across platforms, AR yielded a higher correctness rate (92.30%) than VR (69.49%), indicating AR's greater effectiveness. These findings suggest that immersive technology can aid JA training in ASD. Future studies should explore long-term benefits and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: 研究分析了在2019-2024年间YouTube、TikTok、Meta和Snapchat发布的352份新闻稿和安全博客，发现社交媒体平台在青少年安全风险沟通中存在不均衡关注和三种有问题的沟通实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然先前研究已充分记录了儿童面临的在线风险，但社交媒体平台如何沟通这些风险以及他们改善青少年安全的努力尚未得到全面研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用归纳和演绎相结合的定性研究方法，分析了四个青少年常用社交平台发布的352份新闻稿和安全博客，开发了七个风险问题领域的综合框架和安全功能分类法。

Result: 分析发现平台沟通在不同风险问题领域关注不均衡，主要集中在内容暴露和人际沟通，而对内容创建、数据访问和平台访问关注较少。同时识别出三种有问题的沟通实践：功能实现与可用性不一致、安全功能运作解释不清晰或不一致、以及缺乏安全功能有效性的证据。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了平台沟通中风险与安全功能描述之间的差距，以及实现平台沟通透明度面临的张力，为平台如何负责任地沟通青少年安全功能提供了指南。

Abstract: Social media platforms have faced increasing scrutiny over whether and how they protect youth online. While online risks to children have been well-documented by prior research, how social media platforms communicate about these risks and their efforts to improve youth safety have not been holistically examined. To fill this gap, we analyzed N=352 press releases and safety-related blogs published between 2019 and 2024 by four platforms popular among youth: YouTube, TikTok, Meta (Facebook and Instagram), and Snapchat. Leveraging both inductive and deductive qualitative approaches, we developed a comprehensive framework of seven problem areas where risks arise, and a taxonomy of safety features that social media platforms claim address these risks. Our analysis revealed uneven emphasis across problem areas, with most communications focused on Content Exposure and Interpersonal Communication, whereas less emphasis was placed on Content Creation, Data Access, and Platform Access. Additionally, we identified three problematic communication practices related to their described safety features, including discrepancies between feature implementation and availability, unclear or inconsistent explanations of safety feature operation, and a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of safety features in mitigating risks once implemented. Based on these findings, we discuss the communication gaps between risks and the described safety features, as well as the tensions in achieving transparency in platform communication. Our analysis of platform communication informs guidelines for responsibly communicating about youth safety features.

Conclusion: HCAI-MM填补了HCAI实施中的方法论空白，通过结构化框架将HCAI与组织设计实践结合，为组织提供实现人本AI价值的技术对齐和成熟度发展路径。

Abstract: Human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) is an approach to AI design, development, and deployment that prioritizes human needs, values, and experiences, ensuring that technology enhances human capabilities, well-being, and workforce empowerment. While HCAI has gained prominence in academic discourse and organizational practice, its implementation remains constrained by the absence of methodological guidance and structured frameworks. In particular, HCAI and organizational design practices are often treated separately, despite their interdependence in shaping effective socio-technical systems. This chapter addresses this gap by introducing the Human-Centered AI Maturity Model (HCAI-MM), a structured framework that enables organizations to evaluate, monitor, and advance their capacity to design and implement HCAI solutions. The model specifies stages of maturity, metrics, tools, governance mechanisms, and best practices, supported by case studies, while also incorporating an organizational design methodology that operationalizes maturity progression. Encompassing dimensions such as human-AI collaboration, explainability, fairness, and user experience, the HCAI-MM provides a roadmap for organizations to move from novice to advanced levels of maturity, aligning AI technologies with human values and organizational design principles.

Abstract: General-purpose conversational AI chatbots and AI companions increasingly provide young adolescents with emotionally supportive conversations, raising questions about how conversational style shapes anthropomorphism and emotional reliance. In a preregistered online experiment with 284 adolescent-parent dyads, youth aged 11-15 and their parents read two matched transcripts in which a chatbot responded to an everyday social problem using either a relational style (first-person, affiliative, commitment language) or a transparent style (explicit nonhumanness, informational tone). Adolescents more often preferred the relational than the transparent style, whereas parents were more likely to prefer transparent style than adolescents. Adolescents rated the relational chatbot as more human-like, likable, trustworthy and emotionally close, while perceiving both styles as similarly helpful. Adolescents who preferred relational style had lower family and peer relationship quality and higher stress and anxiety than those preferring transparent style or both chatbots. These findings identify conversational style as a key design lever for youth AI safety, showing that relational framing heightens anthropomorphism, trust and emotional closeness and can be especially appealing to socially and emotionally vulnerable adolescents, who may be at increased risk for emotional reliance on conversational AI.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly operate in environments characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), where early indicators of change often emerge as weak, fragmented signals. Although artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used to support managerial decision-making, most AI-based systems remain optimized for prediction and resolution, leading to premature interpretive closure under conditions of high ambiguity. This creates a gap in management science regarding how human-AI systems can responsibly manage ambiguity before it crystallizes into error or crisis. This study addresses this gap by presenting a proof of concept (PoC) of the LAIZA human-AI augmented symbiotic intelligence system and its patented process: Systems and Methods for Quantum-Inspired Rogue Variable Modeling (QRVM), Human-in-the-Loop Decoherence, and Collective Cognitive Inference. The mechanism operationalizes ambiguity as a non-collapsed cognitive state, detects persistent interpretive breakdowns (rogue variables), and activates structured human-in-the-loop clarification when autonomous inference becomes unreliable. Empirically, the article draws on a three-month case study conducted in 2025 within the AI development, involving prolonged ambiguity surrounding employee intentions and intellectual property boundaries. The findings show that preserving interpretive plurality enabled early scenario-based preparation, including proactive patent protection, allowing decisive and disruption-free action once ambiguity collapsed. The study contributes to management theory by reframing ambiguity as a first-class construct and demonstrates the practical value of human-AI symbiosis for organizational resilience in VUCA environments.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), and the availability of services that make them accessible, have led the general public to begin incorporating them into everyday life. The extended reality (XR) community has also sought to integrate LLMs, particularly in the form of conversational agents, to enhance user experience and task efficiency. When interacting with such conversational agents, users may easily disclose sensitive information due to the naturalistic flow of the conversations, and combining such conversational data with fine-grained sensor data may lead to novel privacy issues. To address these issues, a user-centric understanding of technology acceptance and concerns is essential. Therefore, to this end, we conducted a large-scale crowdsourcing study with 1036 participants, examining user decision-making processes regarding LLM-powered conversational agents in XR, across factors of XR setting type, speech interaction type, and data processing location. We found that while users generally accept these technologies, they express concerns related to security, privacy, social implications, and trust. Our results suggest that familiarity plays a crucial role, as daily generative AI use is associated with greater acceptance. In contrast, previous ownership of XR devices is linked to less acceptance, possibly due to existing familiarity with the settings. We also found that men report higher acceptance with fewer concerns than women. Regarding data type sensitivity, location data elicited the most significant concern, while body temperature and virtual object states were considered least sensitive. Overall, our study highlights the importance of practitioners effectively communicating their measures to users, who may remain distrustful. We conclude with implications and recommendations for LLM-powered XR.

Motivation: 视线交互在免手持移动交互中具有潜力，但每种视线输入技术都有其优点和局限性。通过技术组合可能放大优势并克服挑战，从而设计更有效的视线交互界面。

Method: 通过用户研究（N=24）比较了三种主流视线输入技术（注视时间、追踪和视线手势）在坐立和行走状态下，用于导航和选取任务的可用性与性能表现，重点关注不同技术组合的效果。

Result: 研究发现：将手势用于导航，配合注视时间或追踪用于选取，相比单独使用任一技术，能提高任务完成时间和成功率。追踪技术可能因增加视觉干扰而对其他技术产生负面影响；手势用于导航可减少误选概率；运动活动（行走）会影响性能表现。

Conclusion: 视线输入技术的有效组合能提升交互性能，为设计高效的视线交互界面提供了指导。未来需考虑技术组合时的视觉干扰问题，并适应不同活动状态下的使用需求。

Abstract: The potential of gaze for hands-free mobile interaction is increasingly evident. While each gaze input technique presents distinct advantages and limitations, a combination can amplify strengths and mitigate challenges. We report on the results of a user study (N=24), in which we compared the usability and performance of pairing three popular gaze input techniques: Dwell Time, Pursuits, and Gaze Gestures, for navigation and selection tasks while sitting and walking. Results show that pairing gestures for navigation with either Dwell time or Pursuits for selection improves task completion time and rate compared to using either individually. We discuss the implications of pairing gaze input techniques, such as how Pursuits may negatively impact other techniques, likely due to the visual clutter it adds, how integrating gestures for navigation reduces the chances of unintentional selections, and the impact of motor activity on performance. Our findings provide insights for effective gaze-enabled interfaces.

Conclusion: 该方法为改进IPCC图表提供了一种系统、科学的评估框架，既赋予设计师改进自由度，又确保了科学准确性

Abstract: We propose a methodology to improve figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), ensuring that all modifications remain scientifically rigorous. IPCC figures are notoriously difficult to understand, and although designers have proposed alternatives, these lack formal IPCC validation and can be dismissed by skeptics. To address this gap, our approach starts from official IPCC figures. We gather their associated learning objectives and devise tests to score a pool of figure readers to assess how well they learn the objectives.We define improvement as higher scores obtained by a comparable reader pool after viewing a revised figure, where all modifications undergo review to ensure scientific validity. This assessment gives freedom to designers, who can deviate from the original design while making sure the objectives are still met and improved. We demonstrate the methodology through a case study and describe unexpected challenges encountered during the process.

Motivation: PCOS是影响10%育龄女性的重要公共卫生问题，现有机器学习方法依赖大规模标注数据、缺乏可解释性，而医学多智能体系统缺乏PCOS领域专业知识集成。

Method: 基于2023国际指南构建结构化协作工作流，模拟临床诊断过程：妇科内分泌智能体与放射科智能体协作验证纳入标准，排除智能体严格排除其他病因，并构建了全面的PCOS知识图谱。

Result: 在公开基准和专门临床数据集上，Mapis显著优于9个基线方法。在临床数据集上，准确率比传统机器学习高13.56%，比单智能体高6.55%，比先前医学多智能体系统高7.05%。

Conclusion: Mapis为首个知识驱动的PCOS诊断多智能体框架，通过结构化指南工作流和领域知识图谱，实现了更准确、可解释的PCOS诊断。

Abstract: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) constitutes a significant public health issue affecting 10% of reproductive-aged women, highlighting the critical importance of developing effective diagnostic tools. Previous machine learning and deep learning detection tools are constrained by their reliance on large-scale labeled data and an lack of interpretability. Although multi-agent systems have demonstrated robust capabilities, the potential of such systems for PCOS detection remains largely unexplored. Existing medical multi-agent frameworks are predominantly designed for general medical tasks, suffering from insufficient domain integration and a lack of specific domain knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Mapis, the first knowledge-grounded multi-agent framework explicitly designed for guideline-based PCOS diagnosis. Specifically, it built upon the 2023 International Guideline into a structured collaborative workflow that simulates the clinical diagnostic process. It decouples complex diagnostic tasks across specialized agents: a gynecological endocrine agent and a radiology agent collaborative to verify inclusion criteria, while an exclusion agent strictly rules out other causes. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive PCOS knowledge graph to ensure verifiable, evidence-based decision-making. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and specialized clinical datasets, benchmarking against nine diverse baselines, demonstrate that Mapis significantly outperforms competitive methods. On the clinical dataset, it surpasses traditional machine learning models by 13.56%, single-agent by 6.55%, and previous medical multi-agent systems by 7.05% in Accuracy.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key development direction in the sixth-generation (6G) era, which provides essential support for the collaborative sensing and communication of future intelligent networks. However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in environments that generate massive, dynamic contexts. However, a critical bottleneck remains: while agents have access to this context, their static prompts lack the mechanisms to manage it effectively, leading to recurring Corrective and Enhancement failures. To address this capability gap, we introduce \textbf{SCOPE} (Self-evolving Context Optimization via Prompt Evolution). SCOPE frames context management as an \textit{online optimization} problem, synthesizing guidelines from execution traces to automatically evolve the agent's prompt. We propose a Dual-Stream mechanism that balances tactical specificity (resolving immediate errors) with strategic generality (evolving long-term principles). Furthermore, we introduce Perspective-Driven Exploration to maximize strategy coverage, increasing the likelihood that the agent has the correct strategy for any given task. Experiments on the HLE benchmark show that SCOPE improves task success rates from 14.23\% to 38.64\% without human intervention. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/JarvisPei/SCOPE.

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

Conclusion: STC框架使大语言模型具备内置的批判性思维能力，代表了向这一方向的重要进展

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dual-engine AI architectural method designed to address the complex problem of exploring potential trajectories in the evolution of art. We present two interconnected components: AIDA (an artificial artist social network) and the Ismism Machine, a system for critical analysis. The core innovation lies in leveraging deep learning and multi-agent collaboration to enable multidimensional simulations of art historical developments and conceptual innovation patterns. The framework explores a shift from traditional unidirectional critique toward an intelligent, interactive mode of reflexive practice. We are currently applying this method in experimental studies on contemporary art concepts. This study introduces a general methodology based on AI-driven critical loops, offering new possibilities for computational analysis of art.
