Deterministic workflow automation cannot meet these requirements, as it lacks the epistemic flexibility, cooperative coordination mechanisms, and norm-sensitive behaviour required for institutional risk-transfer.\n  We propose the Reinsurance Constrained Multi-Agent Simulation Process (R-CMASP), a formal model that extends stochastic games and Dec-POMDPs by adding three missing elements: (i) simulator-coupled transition dynamics grounded in catastrophe, capital, and portfolio engines; (ii) role-specialized agents with structured observability, belief updates, and typed communication; and (iii) a normative feasibility layer encoding solvency, regulatory, and organizational rules as admissibility constraints on joint actions.\n  Using LLM-based agents with tool access and typed message protocols, we show in a domain-calibrated synthetic environment that governed multi-agent coordination yields more stable, coherent, and norm-adherent behaviour than deterministic automation or monolithic LLM baselines--reducing pricing variance, improving capital efficiency, and increasing clause-interpretation accuracy. Embedding prudential norms as admissibility constraints and structuring communication into typed acts measurably enhances equilibrium stability.\n  Overall, the results suggest that regulated, simulator-driven decision environments are most naturally modelled as norm-governed, simulator-coupled multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On the Stochastic Nature and Abductive Appearance of Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "This article looks at how reasoning works in current Large Language Models (LLMs) that function using the token-completion method. It examines their stochastic nature and their similarity to human abductive reasoning. The argument is that these LLMs create text based on learned patterns rather than performing actual abductive reasoning. When their output seems abductive, this is largely because they are trained on human-generated texts that include reasoning structures. Examples are used to show how LLMs can produce plausible ideas, mimic commonsense reasoning, and give explanatory answers without being grounded in truth, semantics, verification, or understanding, and without performing any real abductive reasoning. This dual nature, where the models have a stochastic base but appear abductive in use, has important consequences for how LLMs are evaluated and applied. They can assist with generating ideas and supporting human thinking, but their outputs must be critically assessed because they cannot identify truth or verify their explanations. The article concludes by addressing five objections to these points, noting some limitations in the analysis, and offering an overall evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8868\u9762\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6982\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5398\u6e05\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\"\u7c7b\u63a8\u7406\"\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u968f\u673a\u672c\u8d28\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bf9\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u89e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u79d1\u5b66\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u8fa8\u6790\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff08\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u53cd\u9a73\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u770b\u4f3c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u663e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5177\u6709\"\u770b\u4f3c\u6eaf\u56e0\u4f46\u4e0d\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u7406\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6216\u7406\u89e3\"\u7684\"\u8868\u9762\u6eaf\u56e0\u6027\"\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u610f\u601d\u8003\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u56e0\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u771f\u503c\u5224\u5b9a\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u5fc5\u987b\u88ab\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u7684\u968f\u673a\u672c\u8d28\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u89c2\u63a8\u7406\u7279\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u53cc\u91cd\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u8def\u5f84\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Normally 3D input device is used for 3D tasks since they perform better than traditional 2D input devices. However, they do not perform better for 2D tasks. This paper presents a bimanual hybrid user interface that supports four interaction modes: a dual 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) input device mode, a dual planar constrained 3DOF input device mode, a dual 2-finger multi-touch mode, and 3D hand and finger gestures. The application is a multi-dimensional visualization with coordinated 3D and 2D views on a desktop VR system. The input devices are buttonballs with seamless switching between 3D and 2D device modes, as well as between free-hand finger input and device usage.

We present a novel question generation pipeline that leverages both the text generation and the probabilistic reasoning abilities of SLMs to generate high-quality questions. Adopting a \"generate-then-validate\" strategy, our pipeline first performs expansive generation to create an abundance of candidate questions and refine them through selective validation based on novel probabilistic reasoning. We conducted two evaluation studies, one with seven human experts and the other with a large language model (LLM), to assess the quality of the generated questions. Most judges (humans or LLMs) agreed that the generated questions had clear answers and generally aligned well with the intended learning objectives. Our findings suggest that an SLM can effectively generate high-quality questions when guided by a well-designed pipeline that leverages its strengths.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f29\u653e\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u671d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u6c34\u5e73\u6846\u76d1\u7763\u822a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u6846\u76d1\u7763\u822a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u5e73\u6846\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u65cb\u8f6c\u6846\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5916\u63a5\u77e9\u5f62\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff1b2\uff09\u5f53\u6240\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u90fd\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7f29\u653e\uff08ABBS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u5730\u653e\u7f29\u771f\u5b9e\u6c34\u5e73\u6846\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u65cb\u8f6c\u6846\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u79f0\u5148\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\uff08SPA\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u822a\u7a7a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5b66\u4e60\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "ABBSPO\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u822a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that BAMBO discovers a superior and more comprehensive Pareto frontier than baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Our agents maintain internal memory states while depositing persistent environmental traces, creating a spatially distributed collective memory without centralized control. Comprehensive validation across five environmental conditions (20x20 to 50x50 grids, 5-20 agents, 50 runs per configuration) reveals a critical asymmetry: individual memory alone provides 68.7% performance improvement over no-memory baselines (1563.87 vs 927.23, p < 0.001), while environmental traces without memory fail completely. This demonstrates that memory functions independently but traces require cognitive infrastructure for interpretation. Systematic density-sweep experiments (rho in [0.049, 0.300], up to 625 agents) validate our theoretical phase transition prediction. On realistic large grids (30x30, 50x50), stigmergic coordination dominates above rho ~ 0.20, with traces outperforming memory by 36-41% on composite metrics despite lower food efficiency.

The current evaluation paradigm reviews numerous individual responses, leading to significant scalability challenges. LLM outputs can be more efficiently represented as a tree structure, reflecting their autoregressive generation process and stochastic token selection.

InFerActive enables on-demand exploration through probability-based filtering and evaluation features, while bridging the semantic gap between computational tokens and human-readable text through adaptive visualization techniques. Through a technical evaluation and user study (N=12), we demonstrate that InFerActive significantly improves evaluation efficiency and enables more comprehensive assessment of model behavior.

This study establishes that this bottleneck arises from existing generative paradigms succumbing to the Statistical Smoothing Trap, a phenomenon that overlooks the high-entropy information acquisition and structured cognitive processes integral to expert-level writing. To address this limitation, we propose the DeepNews Framework, an agentic workflow that explicitly models the implicit cognitive processes of seasoned financial journalists. The framework integrates three core modules: first, a dual-granularity retrieval mechanism grounded in information foraging theory, which enforces a 10:1 saturated information input ratio to mitigate hallucinatory outputs; second, schema-guided strategic planning, a process leveraging domain expert knowledge bases (narrative schemas) and Atomic Blocks to forge a robust logical skeleton; third, adversarial constraint prompting, a technique deploying tactics including Rhythm Break and Logic Fog to disrupt the probabilistic smoothness inherent in model-generated text. Experiments delineate a salient Knowledge Cliff in deep financial reporting: content truthfulness collapses when retrieved context falls below 15,000 characters, while a high-redundancy input exceeding 30,000 characters stabilizes the Hallucination-Free Rate (HFR) above 85%.

In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points. On top of the strong results, we performed extensive experiments to validate the proposal and analyze the impact of the suggestion module. Results demonstrate a positive correlation between suggestion and caption quality, overall indicating a currently underexplored but promising research direction.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines.

In the first stage, we employ large language models (LLMs) to independently evaluate retrieved articles and compute an aggregated agreement score that reflects the overall evidence stance.

To address the limited query-rejection capability of current voice assistants, this paper presents the first Chinese-oriented open-source benchmark and evaluation suite for smart homes, together with a personalized query-rejection method based on large language models. On the data side, we construct the first multimodal query-rejection dataset tailored for domestic scenarios, containing 11,913 manually labeled text-speech pairs that systematically cover twelve typical dialogue types (e.g., chit-chat, non-human sounds, valid commands, ambiguous references, device-irrelevant requests). Fine-grained labels, conversational context and multi-turn information are provided to support both zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations across language and multimodal large models. On the method side, we propose a three-tier collaborative architecture: first, a Qwen-2.5-3B adapter fine-tuned to model family-agnostic semantic boundaries; second, a dynamic household-level historical dialogue module to capture personalized habits; third, a household-specific RAG knowledge base that explicitly memorizes and revises past false-rejection cases. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and fine-tuned general LLMs on the constructed dataset, with pronounced gains in rejection accuracy for family-specific expressions and complex multi-turn scenarios.

We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Causal discovery aims to recover a graph from data that succinctly describes these cause-effect relationships. However, current methods face several challenges, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. Incorporating prior knowledge about the system can aid causal discovery. In this work, we leverage Cluster-DAGs as a prior knowledge framework to warm-start causal discovery. We show that Cluster-DAGs offer greater flexibility than existing approaches based on tiered background knowledge and introduce two modified constraint-based algorithms, Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI, for causal discovery in the fully and partially observed setting, respectively. Empirical evaluation on simulated data demonstrates that Cluster-PC and Cluster-FCI outperform their respective baselines without prior knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

It implements a multi-agent system consisting of two agents: an adult language model and a daughter language model that aims to learn the mother language. Crucially, the daughter agent does not have access to the internal knowledge of the mother language model but only to the language exemplars the mother agent generates. These experiments illustrate how this system can be used to acquire abstract grammatical knowledge. We demonstrate how statistical analyses of patterns in the input data corresponding to grammatical categories yield discrete grammatical rules. These rules are subsequently added to the grammatical knowledge of the daughter language model. To this end, hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis was applied to the utterances consecutively generated by the mother language model. It is argued that this procedure can be used to acquire structures resembling grammatical categories proposed by linguists for natural languages. Thus, it is established that non-trivial grammatical knowledge has been acquired. Moreover, the parameter configuration of this computational laboratory environment determined using training data generated by the mother language model is validated in a second experiment with a test set similarly resulting in the acquisition of non-trivial categories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u793a\u4f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u51dd\u805a\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u53e5\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51fa\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u513f\u7ae5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u513f\u7ae5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e60\u5f97\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4e60\u5f97\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

This paper explores the challenges of adapting an English-trained VLM to different languages. To this end, we will explore and compare different methods for their performance and computational cost. We consider a translation-based pipeline, LoRA finetuning, and a two-stage finetuning strategy that separates vision adaptation from language adaptation. To evaluate these methods, we use a combination of standard multimodal benchmarks translated into the target language and manual assessments by native experts.

Despite their broad utility in drug discovery and protein engineering, the technical complexity of MD setup, encompassing parameterization, input preparation, and software configuration, remains a major barrier for widespread and efficient usage. Agentic LLMs have demonstrated their capacity to autonomously execute multi-step scientific processes, and to date, they have not successfully been used to automate protein-ligand MD workflows. Here, we present DynaMate, a modular multi-agent framework that autonomously designs and executes complete MD workflows for both protein and protein-ligand systems, and offers free energy binding affinity calculations with the MM/PB(GB)SA method. The framework integrates dynamic tool use, web search, PaperQA, and a self-correcting behavior. DynaMate comprises three specialized modules, interacting to plan the experiment, perform the simulation, and analyze the results. We evaluated its performance across twelve benchmark systems of varying complexity, assessing success rate, efficiency, and adaptability. DynaMate reliably performed full MD simulations, corrected runtime errors through iterative reasoning, and produced meaningful analyses of protein-ligand interactions.

We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents.

Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication.

Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

We show that LLMs develop linear representations of user demographics within activation space, wherein stereotypically associated attributes are encoded along interpretable geometric directions. We first probe residual streams across layers of four open transformer-based LLMs (Magistral 24B, Qwen3 14B, GPT-OSS 20B, OLMo2-1B) prompted with explicit demographic disclosure. We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics.

Sliding window attention (SWA) reduces this cost to linear complexity, but naively enabling complete SWA at inference-time for models pretrained with full attention (FA) causes severe long-context performance degradation due to training-inference mismatch. This makes us wonder: Can FA-pretrained LLMs be well adapted to SWA without pretraining? We investigate this by proposing Sliding Window Attention Adaptation (SWAA), a set of practical recipes that combine five methods for better adaptation: (1) applying SWA only during prefilling; (2) preserving \"sink\" tokens; (3) interleaving FA/SWA layers; (4) chain-of-thought (CoT); and (5) fine-tuning. Our experiments show that SWA adaptation is feasible while non-trivial: no single method suffices, yet specific synergistic combinations effectively recover the original long-context performance. We further analyze the performance-efficiency trade-offs of different SWAA configurations and provide recommended recipes for diverse scenarios.

Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details.

While ``Decomposition-and-Fill'' methods like Skeleton-of-Thought attempt to parallelize generation via external orchestration, they suffer from \\textit{coherence drift} due to the lack of cross-stream communication. In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.\n  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \\textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone.

To address these limitations, we propose CoopRAG, a novel RAG framework for the question answering task in which a retriever and an LLM work cooperatively with each other by exchanging informative knowledge, and the earlier and later layers of the retriever model work cooperatively with each other to accurately rank the retrieved documents relevant to a given query. In this framework, we (i) unroll a question into sub-questions and a reasoning chain in which uncertain positions are masked, (ii) retrieve the documents relevant to the question augmented with the sub-questions and the reasoning chain, (iii) rerank the documents by contrasting layers of the retriever, and (iv) reconstruct the reasoning chain by filling the masked positions via the LLM. Our experiments demonstrate that CoopRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QA methods on three multi-hop QA datasets as well as a simple QA dataset in terms of both the retrieval and QA performances.

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions. We cold start latent CoT by supervising the model's action proposals and world model tokens based on ground-truth future rollouts of the scene. We then post-train with closed-loop reinforcement learning to strengthen reasoning capabilities.

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u654f\u6377\u5ba1\u8bae'\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u5ba1\u8bae\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6f14\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684'\u4eba\u5728\u73af\u4e2d'\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u6237\u5df2\u7ecf\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5f80\u5f80\u4ece\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7'\u6982\u5ff5\u5ba1\u8bae'\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002\u4ece\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b9e\u8df5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u4eba\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5ba1\u8bae\u7b56\u7565\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u4e3a'\u654f\u6377\u5ba1\u8bae'\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u6982\u5ff5\u754c\u5b9a - \u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b50\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u6b21\uff1b2) \u6982\u5ff5\u8fed\u4ee3 - \u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5c55\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u8fb9\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc718\u4e2a1.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff08\u800c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u654f\u6377\u5ba1\u8bae\u6bd4\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u83b7\u5f977.5%\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u8bae\u9ad8\u51fa3%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u654f\u6377\u5ba1\u8bae\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e3b\u89c2\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5ba1\u8bae\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u6982\u5ff5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66b4\u9732\u8fb9\u754c\u6848\u4f8b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u7cbe\u70bc\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These tools generate \"tortured phrases\", statistically improbable synonyms (e.g. \"counterfeit consciousness\" for \"artificial intelligence\"), that preserve the local grammar while obscuring the original source. Most existing detection methods depend heavily on static blocklists or general-domain language models, which suffer from high false-negative rates for novel obfuscations and cannot determine the source of the plagiarized content. In this paper, we propose Semantic Reconstruction of Adversarial Plagiarism (SRAP), a framework designed not only to detect these anomalies but to mathematically recover the original terminology. We use a two-stage architecture: (1) statistical anomaly detection with a domain-specific masked language model (SciBERT) using token-level pseudo-perplexity, and (2) source-based semantic reconstruction using dense vector retrieval (FAISS) and sentence-level alignment (SBERT). Experiments on a parallel corpus of adversarial scientific text show that while zero-shot baselines fail completely (0.00 percent restoration accuracy), our retrieval-augmented approach achieves 23.67 percent restoration accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline methods. We also show that static decision boundaries are necessary for robust detection in jargon-heavy scientific text, since dynamic thresholding fails under high variance. SRAP enables forensic analysis by linking obfuscated expressions back to their most probable source documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks. Notably, our conditional framework enables dynamic and multiple-axis control at inference time using Classifier Free Guidance to amplify specific reward dimensions without additional training or external reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set. Extensive experiments on five SSFSL benchmarks show that SWIFT outperforms recent FSL and SSL methods by $\\sim$5 accuracy points.

Deep learning mod- els often struggle with real-world distribution changes, exhibit bias against infrequent pathologies, and lack the transparency required for deployment in safety-critical clinical environments. We introduce MedXAI (An Explainable Framework for Med- ical Imaging Classification), a unified expert knowledge based framework that integrates deep vision models with clinician- derived expert knowledge to improve generalization, reduce rare- class bias, and provide human-understandable explanations by localizing the relevant diagnostic features rather than relying on technical post-hoc methods (e.g., Saliency Maps, LIME). We evaluate MedXAI across heterogeneous modalities on two challenging tasks: (i) Seizure Onset Zone localization from resting-state fMRI, and (ii) Diabetic Retinopathy grading.

While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies.

The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems.

In traditional generative grammar, systematic contrasts in grammaticality such as subject-auxiliary inversion and the licensing of parasitic gaps are taken as evidence for an internal, hierarchical grammar. In this paper, we test whether large language models (LLMs), trained only on surface forms, reproduce these contrasts in ways that imply an underlying structural representation.\n  We focus on two classic constructions: subject-auxiliary inversion (testing recognition of the subject boundary) and parasitic gap licensing (testing abstract dependency structure). We evaluate models including GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 using prompts eliciting acceptability ratings. Results show that LLMs reliably distinguish between grammatical and ungrammatical variants in both constructions, and as such support that they are sensitive to structure and not just linear order.

However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

However, in the domain of agriculture, general-purpose models frequently suffer from contextual hallucination, which provides non-factual advice or answers are scientifically sound in one region but disastrous in another due to variations in soil, climate, and local regulations. We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields. Experiments demonstrate that AgriRegion reduces hallucinations by 10-20% compared to state-of-the-art LLMs systems and significantly improves trust scores according to a comprehensive evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AgriRegion\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11LLMs\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5efa\u8bae\u6216\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u5374\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u533a\u57df\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u571f\u58e4\u3001\u6c14\u5019\u548c\u5730\u65b9\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u9020\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u7684\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgriRegion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6ce8\u5165\u5c42\u548c\u533a\u57df\u4f18\u5148\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5df2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u519c\u4e1a\u63a8\u5e7f\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u52a0\u5165\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u79cd\u690d\u65e5\u7a0b\u3001\u5bb3\u866b\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u65bd\u80a5\u7b49\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u672c\u5730\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cAgriRegion\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u51cf\u5c1110-20%\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fe1\u4efb\u5206\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "AgriRegion\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u901a\u7528LLMs\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u533a\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u672c\u5730\u5316\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u54a8\u8be2\uff0c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The imaging noise, artifacts, and the deformation and motion of the heart pose challenges to segmentation algorithms. While existing methods based on convolutional neural networks, Transformers, and space-time memory networks have improved segmentation accuracy, they often struggle with the trade-off between capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency with fine-grained feature representation. In this paper, we introduce GDKVM, a novel architecture for echocardiography video segmentation. The model employs Linear Key-Value Association (LKVA) to effectively model inter-frame correlations, and introduces Gated Delta Rule (GDR) to efficiently store intermediate memory states. Key-Pixel Feature Fusion (KPFF) module is designed to integrate local and global features at multiple scales, enhancing robustness against boundary blurring and noise interference. We validated GDKVM on two mainstream echocardiography video datasets (CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic) and compared it with various state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that GDKVM outperforms existing approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, while ensuring real-time performance.

The 2025 FMTI introduces new indicators related to data acquisition, usage data, and monitoring and evaluates companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and xAI for the first time. The 2024 FMTI reported that transparency was improving, but the 2025 FMTI finds this progress has deteriorated: the average score out of 100 fell from 58 in 2024 to 40 in 2025. Companies are most opaque about their training data and training compute as well as the post-deployment usage and impact of their flagship models. In spite of this general trend, IBM stands out as a positive outlier, scoring 95, in contrast to the lowest scorers, xAI and Midjourney, at just 14. The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders.

Causal reasoning demands multihop composition and strict conjunctive control, and reliance on spurious lexical relations of the input could provide misleading results. We hypothesize that, due to their ability to project the input into a latent space, encoder and encoder decoder architectures are better suited for said multihop conjunctive reasoning versus decoder only models. To do this, we compare fine-tuned versions of all the aforementioned architectures with zero and few shot ICL in both natural language and non natural language scenarios. We find that ICL alone is insufficient for reliable causal reasoning, often overfocusing on irrelevant input features.

Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering.

Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%.

In this paper, we argue that the i.i.d. setting can and should be reframed in terms of exchangeability, a strictly more general symmetry principle. We present the implications of this reframing, alongside two core arguments: (1) a conceptual argument, based on extending the dependency of experimental causal inference on exchangeability to causal discovery; and (2) an empirical argument, showing that many existing i.i.d. causal-discovery methods are predicated on exchangeability assumptions, and that the sole extensive widely-used real-world \"i.i.d.\" benchmark (the T\u00fcbingen dataset) consists mainly of exchangeable (and not i.i.d.) examples. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset that enforces only the exchangeability assumption, without imposing the stronger i.i.d. assumption. We show that our exchangeable synthetic dataset mirrors the statistical structure of the real-world \"i.i.d.\" dataset more closely than all other i.i.d. synthetic datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the predictive capability of this dataset by proposing a neural-network-based causal-discovery algorithm trained exclusively on our synthetic dataset, and which performs similarly to other state-of-the-art i.i.d. methods on the real-world benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these challenges, we present AgriGPT-Omni, an agricultural omni-framework that integrates speech, vision, and text in a unified framework. First, we construct a scalable data synthesis and collection pipeline that converts agricultural texts and images into training data, resulting in the largest agricultural speech dataset to date, including 492K synthetic and 1.4K real speech samples across six languages. Second, based on this, we train the first agricultural omni-model via a three-stage paradigm: textual knowledge injection, progressive multimodal alignment, and GRPO-based reinforcement learning, enabling unified reasoning across languages and modalities. Third, we propose AgriBench-Omni-2K, the first tri-modal benchmark for agriculture, covering diverse speech-vision-text tasks and multilingual slices, with standardized protocols and reproducible tools. Experiments show that AgriGPT-Omni significantly outperforms general-purpose baselines on multilingual and multimodal reasoning as well as real-world speech understanding. All models, data, benchmarks, and code will be released to promote reproducible research, inclusive agricultural intelligence, and sustainable AI development for low-resource regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing work often neglects to incorporate state-of-the-art robust teachers. Through extensive analysis, we find that stronger teachers do not necessarily yield more robust students-a phenomenon known as robust saturation. While typically attributed to capacity gaps, we show that such explanations are incomplete. Instead, we identify adversarial transferability-the fraction of student-crafted adversarial examples that remain effective against the teacher-as a key factor in successful robustness transfer. Based on this insight, we propose Sample-wise Adaptive Adversarial Distillation (SAAD), which reweights training examples by their measured transferability without incurring additional computational cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet show that SAAD consistently improves AutoAttack robustness over prior methods.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality. These results indicate that CIEGAD serves as a practically oriented data augmentation framework that complements underrepresented regions while preserving alignment with real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCIEGAD\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6784\u9020\u9886\u57df\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c7b\u8fb9\u754c\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u533a\u57df\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b8c\u6574\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "CIEGAD\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6784\u9020\u9886\u57df\u753b\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u9891\u7387\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u9891\u7387-\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u63d2\u503c\u548c\u5916\u63a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u63a7\u5236\uff1b4\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548cLLM-as-a-Judge\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCIEGAD\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cCIEGAD\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "CIEGAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Unlike existing image editing datasets that focus on static appearance changes or contain only sparse, low-quality motion edits, MotionEdit provides high-fidelity image pairs depicting realistic motion transformations extracted and verified from continuous videos. This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.\n  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations.

While forward reasoning approaches like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) have shown success in structured problem-solving, they frequently fail to systematically identify and recover omitted information. In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks. Drawing inspiration from recent work on backward reasoning, we propose a novel framework that guides LLMs through reverse thinking to identify necessary conditions and pinpoint missing elements. Our approach transforms the challenging task of missing information identification into a more manageable backward reasoning problem, significantly improving model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our reverse thinking approach achieves substantial performance gains compared to traditional forward reasoning methods, providing a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical completeness and reasoning robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Regulations such as the European AI Act require identifying and mitigating biases against protected groups in data, with the ultimate goal of preventing unfair model outputs. However, practical guidance and operationalization are lacking. We propose a comprehensive data bias detection and mitigation pipeline comprising four components that address two data bias types, namely representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes for a configurable sensitive attribute. First, we leverage LLM-generated word lists created based on quality criteria to detect relevant group labels. Second, representation bias is quantified using the Demographic Representation Score. Third, we detect and mitigate stereotypes using sociolinguistically informed filtering. Finally, we compensate representation bias through Grammar- and Context-Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation. We conduct a two-fold evaluation using the examples of gender, religion and age. First, the effectiveness of each individual component on data debiasing is evaluated through human validation and baseline comparison. The findings demonstrate that we successfully reduce representation bias and (explicit) stereotypes in a text dataset. Second, the effect of data debiasing on model bias reduction is evaluated by bias benchmarking of several models (0.6B-8B parameters), fine-tuned on the debiased text dataset. This evaluation reveals that LLMs fine-tuned on debiased data do not consistently show improved performance on bias benchmarks, exposing critical gaps in current evaluation methodologies and highlighting the need for targeted data manipulation to address manifested model bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \\textit{content-target} and \\textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics.

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{O}utcome-based \\textbf{P}rocess \\textbf{V}erifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present TRIDENT (Transcription and Routing Intelligence for Dispatcher-Empowered National Triage), a three-layer dispatcher-support architecture designed to structure emergency call inputs for human application of established triage protocols (the ESI for routine operations and START for mass casualty events), even when automatic speech recognition fails.\n  The system combines Caribbean-accent-tuned ASR, local entity extraction via large language models, and bio-acoustic distress detection to provide dispatchers with three complementary signals: transcription confidence, structured clinical entities, and vocal stress indicators. Our key insight is that low ASR confidence, rather than representing system failure, serves as a valuable queue prioritization signal -- particularly when combined with elevated vocal distress markers indicating a caller in crisis whose speech may have shifted toward basilectal registers. A complementary insight drives the entity extraction layer: trained responders and composed bystanders may report life-threatening emergencies without elevated vocal stress, requiring semantic analysis to capture clinical indicators that paralinguistic features miss.\n  We describe the architectural design, theoretical grounding in psycholinguistic research on stress-induced code-switching, and deployment considerations for offline operation during disaster scenarios.

However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR).

To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy. When clients are not \\emph{i.i.d}, aggregating their local models may discard certain local adaptations. To overcome this, we propose an \\textbf{important weight} aggregation strategy to prioritize parameters that significantly influence predictions of local models during aggregation. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods with less communication overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants.

This advancement is also inseparable from the oversight automated by reliable verifiers. However, current outcome-based verifiers (OVs) are unable to inspect the unreliable intermediate steps in the long reasoning chains of thought (CoTs). Meanwhile, current process-based verifiers (PVs) have difficulties in reliably detecting errors in the complex long CoTs, limited by the scarcity of high-quality annotations due to the prohibitive costs of human annotations. Therefore, we propose the Outcome-based Process Verifier (OPV), which verifies the rationale process of summarized outcomes from long CoTs to achieve both accurate and efficient verification and enable large-scale annotation. To empower the proposed verifier, we adopt an iterative active learning framework with expert annotations to progressively improve the verification capability of OPV with fewer annotation costs. Specifically, in each iteration, the most uncertain cases of the current best OPV are annotated and then subsequently used to train a new OPV through Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT) and RLVR for the next round. Extensive experiments demonstrate OPV's superior performance and broad applicability. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on our held-out OPV-Bench, outperforming much larger open-source models such as Qwen3-Max-Preview with an F1 score of 83.1 compared to 76.3.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline.

To address these issues, we propose InfoCom, an information-aware framework establishing the pioneering theoretical foundation for communication-efficient collaborative perception via extended Information Bottleneck principles. Departing from mainstream feature manipulation, InfoCom introduces a novel information purification paradigm that theoretically optimizes the extraction of minimal sufficient task-critical information under Information Bottleneck constraints. Its core innovations include: i) An Information-Aware Encoding condensing features into minimal messages while preserving perception-relevant information; ii) A Sparse Mask Generation identifying spatial cues with negligible communication cost; and iii) A Multi-Scale Decoding that progressively recovers perceptual information through mask-guided mechanisms rather than simple feature reconstruction.

In this work, we investigate scaling as an efficient strategy for adapting pretrained models to new target languages. Through comprehensive scaling ablations with approximately FLOP-matched models, we test whether upscaling an English base model enables more effective and resource-efficient adaptation than standard continued pretraining. We find that, once exposed to sufficient target-language data, larger upscaled models can match or surpass the performance of smaller models continually pretrained on much more data, demonstrating the benefits of scaling for data efficiency. Scaling also helps preserve the base model's capabilities in English, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we explore whether such scaled, language-specific models can be merged to construct modular and flexible multilingual systems. We find that while merging remains less effective than joint multilingual training, upscaled merges perform better than smaller ones.

Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types.

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86R\u00b2-HGP\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5ffd\u89c6\u548c\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfMGP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1)\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u963b\u788d\u77e5\u8bc6\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b2)\u5ffd\u7565\u5148\u9a8c\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bfc\u81f4\u6620\u5c04\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b3)\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u8d77\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f02\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u57df\uff1b2)\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fbGP\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff1b3)\u52a0\u5165\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\uff1b4)\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fbGP\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65bd\u52a0\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u6e90\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1R\u00b2-HGP\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "R\u00b2-HGP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In many such settings, speakers of Indian languages frequently communicate using romanized text rather than native scripts, yet existing research rarely evaluates this orthographic variation using real-world data. We investigate how romanization impacts the reliability of LLMs in a critical domain: maternal and newborn healthcare triage. We benchmark leading LLMs on a real-world dataset of user-generated queries spanning five Indian languages and Nepali. Our results reveal consistent degradation in performance for romanized messages, with F1 scores trailing those of native scripts by 5-12 points. At our partner maternal health organization in India, this gap could cause nearly 2 million excess errors in triage. Crucially, this performance gap by scripts is not due to a failure in clinical reasoning. We demonstrate that LLMs often correctly infer the semantic intent of romanized queries. Nevertheless, their final classification outputs remain brittle in the presence of orthographic noise in romanized inputs. Our findings highlight a critical safety blind spot in LLM-based health systems: models that appear to understand romanized input may still fail to act on it reliably.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency.

Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EchoingPixels\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve\u6a21\u5757\u548cSynchronization-Augmented RoPE\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408token\u7cbe\u7b80\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u5de8\u91cf\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891token\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u6a21\u6001token\u7cbe\u7b80\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u7cbe\u7b80\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EchoingPixels\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662fCross-Modal Semantic Sieve\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u6574\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9token\u7ec4\u5408\u6c60\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Synchronization-Augmented RoPE\uff08Sync-RoPE\uff09\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9token\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEchoingPixels\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cbtoken\u76845-20%\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862-3\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "EchoingPixels\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u5408token\u7cbe\u7b80\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.\n  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.\n  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

This learned fusion approach captures complementary strengths of LLM reasoning and traditional transformer-based classifiers, yielding robust performance across domains -- achieving 92.4% accuracy on AG News and 92.3% on 10-class Reuters 21578 topic classification -- while enabling practical trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86LabelFusion\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u878d\u5408\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Transformer-based\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u5982RoBERTa\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GPT\u3001Gemini\u3001DeepSeek\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u878d\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aLabelFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5backbone\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\uff08\u901a\u8fc7prompt\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\u5f97\u5230\u7684\uff09\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6982\u7387/\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08FusionMLP\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6574\u4e2aPipeline\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff1aAG News\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cReuters 21578\uff0810\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523092.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1aLabelFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0eLLM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u524d\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u540e\u8005\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.\n  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.\n  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.\n  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u6790agentic\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6c\u6362\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u9664\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86agentic\u5faa\u73af\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684agentic\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u6216\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63ed\u793aagentic\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1. \u533a\u5206\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u53d1\u751f\uff09\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\uff09\n2. \u5f15\u5165\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u9664\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\n3. \u5c06\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6c\u6362\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\n4. \u5728\u5355agentic\u5faa\u73af\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "1. \u6536\u7f29\u6027\u91cd\u5199\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u9012\u51cf\n2. \u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3-\u5426\u5b9a\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u65e0\u805a\u7c7b\u5f62\u6210\n3. \u4e24\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u663e\u793a\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6269\u5f20\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236agentic\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u4eba\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Existing methods often overlook this dynamic process, typically assuming that emerging items have few or even no historical interactions. Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks.

Leveraging advancements in large language models (LLMs), we propose Cyclical Urban Planning (CUP), a new paradigm that continuously generates, evaluates, and refines urban plans in a closed-loop. Specifically, our multi-agent LLM-based framework consists of three key components: (1) Planning, where LLM agents generate and refine urban plans based on contextual data; (2) Living, where agents simulate the behaviors and interactions of residents, modeling life in the urban environment; and (3) Judging, which involves evaluating plan effectiveness and providing iterative feedback for improvement. The cyclical process enables a dynamic and responsive planning approach.

HD-CLIP leverages semantic cues to guide generative restoration while using degradation cues to suppress undesired hallucinations and artifacts.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step.

While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics.

Current protection methods are limited to passively degrading image quality, failing to achieve stable control. While Targeted Data Protection (TDP) offers a promising paradigm for active redirection toward user-specified target concepts, existing TDP attempts suffer from poor controllability due to snapshot-matching approaches that fail to account for complete learning dynamics. We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality.

The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization. TranSamba achieves effective volumetric modeling with time complexity that scales linearly with the input volume depth and maintains constant memory usage for batch processing.

In this work, we derive a unified operator-theoretoretic description of neural training dynamics directly from gradient descent. Starting from the exact evolution $\\dot e_t = -M(t)e_t$ in function space, we apply Kato perturbation theory to obtain a rigorous system of coupled mode ODEs and show that, after coarse-graining, these dynamics converge to a spectral transport--dissipation PDE \\[ \\partial_t g + \\partial_\u03bb(v g) = -\u03bbg + S, \\] where $v$ captures eigenbasis drift and $S$ encodes nonlocal spectral coupling.\n  We prove that neural training preserves functional regularity, forcing the drift to take an asymptotic power-law form $v(\u03bb,t)\\sim -c(t)\u03bb^b$. In the weak-coupling regime -- naturally induced by spectral locality and SGD noise -- the PDE admits self-similar solutions with a resolution frontier, polynomial amplitude growth, and power-law dissipation. This structure yields explicit scaling-law exponents, explains the geometry of double descent, and shows that the effective training time satisfies $\u03c4(t)=t^\u03b1L(t)$ for slowly varying $L$.\n  Finally, we show that NTK training and feature learning arise as two limits of the same PDE: $v\\equiv 0$ recovers lazy dynamics, while $v\\neq 0$ produces representation drift.

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy.

This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual).

InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages.

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction.

We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation.

However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead.

P2S overcomes these challenges with two key innovations: an 'Adaptive Span Generator' to prevent the search phase candidate explosion, and 'Query Decomposition' to refine candidates without relying on high-cost VLM verification.

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space.

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results.

ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings.

Recently, Neural Collapse (NC) has been proposed as an emergent geometric property of deep neural networks (DNNs), providing valuable insights for TTA. In this work, we extend NC to the sample-wise level and discover a novel phenomenon termed Sample-wise Alignment Collapse (NC3+), demonstrating that a sample's feature embedding, obtained by a trained model, aligns closely with the corresponding classifier weight. Building on NC3+, we identify that the performance degradation stems from sample-wise misalignment in adaptation which exacerbates under larger distribution shifts. This indicates the necessity of realigning the feature embeddings with their corresponding classifier weights. However, the misalignment makes pseudo-labels unreliable under domain shifts.

The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network. Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\u03b2$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence.

In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR.

The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive R-D performance compared with the state-of-the-arts, while successfully eliminating error propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51fa\u8272\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u5931\u771f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1/\u8865\u507f\uff08ME/MC\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e24\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002\u5206\u79bb\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u660e\u663e\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u4f46\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u4e2d\u7684ME/MC\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u5149\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6f5c\u5728\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u7684\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u70bc\uff09\n2. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20\u91cf\u5316\u6b65\u957f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u7eed\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u9002\u5e94\n3. \u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u53d8\u6362\u6d88\u9664\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7801\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u6362\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u57df\u6e10\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u65e0\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.\n  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we introduce \\textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization.

Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential \"blink-like\" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus.

Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency. To exploit GSNO, we develop GSHNet, a hierarchical architecture that combines multi-scale spectral modeling with spherical up-down sampling, enhancing global feature representation.

To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture.

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity.

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we reveal a critical insight: well-crafted feature extraction inherently encodes degradation-carrying information, and a symmetric U-Net architecture is sufficient to unleash these cues effectively. By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors.

To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations.

We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models.

Our key insight is that motion patterns, when aligned with contrastive vision-language representations, provide powerful semantic signals for recognizing and describing actions. Through unified training that combines global video-text alignment with fine-grained spatial correspondence, TCAM enables query-free discovery of multiple motion expressions via multi-head cross-attention.

A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees.

Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings.

While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations.

While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence. This hybrid strategy enables 5-10X speedup while retaining over 85% of the original trackers' accuracy. We evaluate K-Track across multiple state-of-the-art point trackers and demonstrate real-time performance on edge platforms such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and RTX Titan. By preserving accuracy while dramatically lowering computational requirements, K-Track provides a practical path toward deploying high-quality point tracking in real-world, resource-limited settings, closing the gap between modern tracking algorithms and deployable vision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects.

While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks.

However, these approaches often introduce high latency, elevated energy consumption, and deployment risks related to connectivity, cost, and data governance; factors that conflict with the practical constraints of real-world robotics, where compute is limited and on-device inference is frequently required. We introduce Geo6DPose, a lightweight, fully local, and training-free pipeline for zero-shot 6D pose estimation that trades model scale for geometric reliability. Our method combines foundation model visual features with a geometric filtering strategy: Similarity maps are computed between onboarded template DINO descriptors and scene patches, and mutual correspondences are established by projecting scene patch centers to 3D and template descriptors to the object model coordinate system. Final poses are recovered via correspondence-driven RANSAC and ranked using a weighted geometric alignment metric that jointly accounts for reprojection consistency and spatial support, improving robustness to noise, clutter, and partial visibility. Geo6DPose achieves sub-second inference on a single commodity GPU while matching the average recall of significantly larger zero-shot baselines (53.7 AR, 1.08 FPS). It requires no training, fine-tuning, or network access, and remains compatible with evolving foundation backbones, advancing practical, fully local 6D perception for robotic deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks.

However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy.

To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation. Our method introduces a novel Propagation Module that refines and propagates depth features and predictions using flow-based warping coupled with learned residual corrections. In addition, our design structurally enforces temporal consistency, resulting in stable depth predictions across consecutive frames with improved efficiency. Comprehensive zero-shot evaluation on multiple benchmarks demonstrates the state-of-the-art temporal consistency and competitive accuracy of VeloDepth, alongside its significantly faster inference compared to existing video-based depth estimators. VeloDepth thus provides a practical, efficient, and accurate solution for real-time depth estimation suitable for diverse perception tasks.

However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance. IRG-MotionLLM is developed progressively with a novel three-stage training scheme, initializing and subsequently enhancing native IRMoGen capabilities. To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets.

However, CFD is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to integrate into large-scale clinical workflows. These limitations restrict the availability of labeled hemodynamic data for training AI models and hinder broad adoption of non-invasive, physiology based CAD assessment. To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference. Evaluated on a dataset of simulated coronary hemodynamics, the proposed model achieves state of the art performance, with an R2 of 64.42%, a root mean squared error of 0.0974, and a normalized RMSE of 0.154, outperforming several baseline approaches. This work provides a scalable and accessible framework for rapid, non-invasive blood pressure prediction to support CAD diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures.

When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SEPL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6316\u6398\u548c\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027", "motivation": "\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u6df1\u5c42\u4f2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u5347", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u96c6\u6210\u540e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SEPL\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7279\u5f81\u63a2\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u4f17\u5305\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u7684\u8f93\u51fa", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0cSEPL\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c"}}

The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

To assess the potential of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in this domain, we propose a systematic benchmark framework MiSI-Bench. This framework features over 163,000 question-answer pairs and 587,000 images derived from approximately 4,000 molecular structures, covering nine complementary tasks that evaluate abilities ranging from elementary spatial transformations to complex relational identifications. Experimental results reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform significantly below human level on this benchmark. However, a fine-tuned 7B model demonstrates substantial potential, even surpassing humans in spatial transformation tasks, while its poor performance in scientifically-grounded tasks like hydrogen bond recognition underscores the necessity of integrating explicit domain knowledge for progress toward scientific AGI.

We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning.

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing. Meanwhile, DAFMM leverages the cluster-guided priors to perform adaptive frequency decomposition and targeted modulation, collaboratively refining structural and textural representations for higher restoration fidelity. The cluster-guided synergy seamlessly bridges semantic cues with frequency-domain modulation, empowering ClusIR to attain remarkable restoration results across a wide range of degradations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks validate that ClusIR reaches competitive performance under several scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner.

NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.\n  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data. We also observe that stereo vision yields higher navigation performance than monocular input.", "AI": {"tldr": "StereoWalker\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(NFMs)\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5757(\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a)\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u50cf\u7d20\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "StereoWalker\u91c7\u7528\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u4ee3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b49\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u578b\u7acb\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u652f\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u540e\uff0c\u4ec5\u75281.5%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u76ee\u8f93\u5165\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u5148\u9a8c\u662f\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\uff1b\u7acb\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite increasing access to satellite and temporal datasets, timely detection and disaster response remain underdeveloped and fragmented. This work introduces CC-GRMAS, a framework leveraging a series of satellite observations and environmental signals to enhance the accuracy of landslide forecasting. The system is structured around three interlinked agents Prediction, Planning, and Execution, which collaboratively enable real time situational awareness, response planning, and intervention. By incorporating local environmental factors and operationalizing multi agent coordination, this approach offers a scalable and proactive solution for climate resilient disaster preparedness across vulnerable mountainous terrains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
