### [1] [Transformed Multi-view 3D Shape Features with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19955)
*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文探讨了在3D形状特征表示学习中的挑战，展示了结合视觉变换器（ViTs）和对比学习目标的先进架构在多视角3D分析中的成功应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着计算机视觉对3D物体识别能力的需求增长，本研究旨在改善2D图像到3D形状的学习过程，克服现有方法在数据标签和形状关系捕捉方面的不足。

Method: 本研究采用深度学习框架，利用视觉变换器与对比学习方法，进行广泛的实验评估，以验证其对3D表示学习的有效性。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，使用监督对比损失达到了约90.6%的准确率, 证明了ViTs和对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过结合ViTs与对比学习的策略，我们能够在不依赖大量标签数据的情况下，有效克服CNN在捕捉3D形状关系方面的局限，提升3D形状理解的精度。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [2] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个基于变换器的多模态三维多目标跟踪框架，通过融合相机和LiDAR数据，实现了高效且准确的跟踪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出FutrTrack，以提高多传感器融合的三维多目标跟踪性能，并解决现有方法在遮挡和视角变化下的身份重识别问题。

Method: 采用多模态双阶段变换器精炼和跟踪管道，无需显式运动模型来整合相机和LiDAR的边界框和特征。

Result: FutrTrack在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上表现良好，相较于单传感器方法，显著改善了身份重识别和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: FutrTrack展示了在多模态传感器特征下，变换器跟踪方法的有效性，并在多项基准测试中展示了竞争力。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [3] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种在线标签平滑（OLS）方法，通过动态调整训练过程中的软标签，提高了医疗图像分类的准确性，并增强了模型的可校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑方法未考虑类之间的关系，无法有效减少模型的过度自信。

Method: 采用在线标签平滑（OLS），根据模型自身的预测模式动态调整软标签。

Result: 在RadImageNet数据集上，OLS在ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19等架构上显著提高了分类准确率，同时产生了更紧凑、分离良好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: 在线标签平滑（OLS）提高了医疗图像分类的准确性和模型的校准能力，是医疗影像领域可信AI系统开发的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [4] [Calibrating Multimodal Consensus for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20256)
*Guowei Zhong,Junjie Li,Huaiyu Zhu,Ruohong Huan,Yun Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的多模态情感识别模型CMC，解决了文本主导性和模态间语义不一致的问题，并在四个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多模态情感识别方法中，模态间语义不一致、文本模态主导性导致的识别准确性问题。

Method: 提出了一种被称为校准多模态共识（CMC）的模型，结合伪标签生成模块和参数无关的融合模块进行多模态情感识别。

Result: CMC在四个数据集上的表现与现有最先进方法持平或优越，特别是在存在语义不一致的情况下具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CMC模型通过引入新模块提高了多模态情感识别的准确性，为未来的研究提供了良好的基础。

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible
at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CMC.

*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种针对鱼眼图像的检测框架，通过预后处理和模型集成策略提高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于鱼眼图像固有的强径向畸变和不均匀分辨率，标准物体检测器在物体外观严重退化的图像边界附近面临挑战，因此需要一种能够在这些条件下稳健操作的检测框架。

Method: 我们提出了一个检测框架，通过简单而有效的预处理和后处理管道来增强检测一致性，并通过集成策略结合几种最先进的检测模型的输出，以提高整体检测精度。

Result: 我们的方法在2025年AI City Challenge Track 4中取得了0.6366的F1得分，在62支团队中名列第8，展示了我们框架在解决鱼眼图像固有问题方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 我们的框架有效解决了鱼眼图像中所固有的检测问题，证明了其在交通监测中的潜力。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268)
*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法 GMFVAD，通过多模态特征精细化视频异常检测，减少冗余信息，提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在结合多模态信息时未能充分挖掘和减少视频片段中的冗余信息。

Method: 通过生成更细致的多模态特征，整合视频片段和文本特征，以增强关键区域的视觉特征。

Result: GMFVAD在性能上达到了当前最先进的水平，并且消除了冗余信息是其提升性能的关键。

Conclusion: GMFVAD在四个主要数据集上表现出色，改善效果显著。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

### [7] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，解决3DGS模型在训练数据外时的视觉噪声问题，显著提升视觉质量，可实时集成到现有渲染管道中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D Gaussian Splatting模型在训练数据分布外的相机位置下产生的视觉噪声问题，主要由于缺乏训练数据导致密度、颜色和几何预测的不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种新的实时渲染感知过滤方法，利用中间梯度的灵敏度分数，专门针对由各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤。

Result: 通过实验评估表明，所提方法在视觉质量、真实感和一致性上显著优于现有的基于NeRF的方法，如BayesRays。

Conclusion: 该过滤方法有效应对生成不确定性，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [8] [Causal Debiasing for Visual Commonsense Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20281)
*Jiayi Zou,Gengyun Jia,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去偏见的视觉常识推理方法，通过创建VCR-OOD数据集和使用字典消除预测捷径，评估模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉常识推理方法虽然具有高预测准确性，但往往忽视了数据集中的偏见问题，并缺乏去偏见策略。

Method: 引入VCR-OOD数据集，分析因果图和预测捷径，采用后门调整方法和基于正确答案集的字典来去除偏见。

Result: 提出了VCR-OOD数据集及其子集，评估模型在多个模态下的泛化能力，分析因果图和预测捷径，并采用后门调整方法去除偏见。

Conclusion: 实验表明所提出的去偏见方法在不同数据集上有效。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle是一个结合物理建模和机器学习的超声脑成像框架，能够在低信噪比和稀疏阵列条件下实现定量声速图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于颅骨与脑组织之间声速的巨大差异以及临床上大探头的耦合难度，定量经颅超声成像仍然充满挑战，本文旨在通过重建声速图准确解决这一问题。

Method: BrainPuzzle框架分为两个阶段：第一阶段应用反向时间迁移生成迁移碎片，第二阶段使用基于变换器的超分辨率编码器-解码器结合图形注意力单元合成声速图像。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的超声脑成像方法BrainPuzzle，该方法结合了物理建模与机器学习，以克服传统方法在信号弱、空间覆盖不足等条件下的限制。研究显示，该方法在合成数据集中的声速重建精度和图像完整性上均表现出色，预示着其在定量超声脑成像领域的潜力。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle方法在合成实验中展现出更好的声速重建精度和图像完整性，表明其在超声脑成像中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

*Jiayi Zou,Chaofan Chen,Bing-Kun Bao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMC$^3$框架以改善第一人称视频问答的性能，通过生成反事实样本进行对比优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分应对第一人称视频特有的挑战，例如理解多个事件和识别手物体交互。

Method: 提出一种双模态反事实对比构建框架（DMC$^3$），包括构建反事实样本和反事实样本参与的对比优化。

Result: 在EgoTaskQA的正常和间接拆分上分别取得52.51%和46.04%，在QAEGO4D上取得13.2%，均达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法有效提升了第一人称视频问答任务的性能，展示了反事实样本的价值。

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估生成图像模型中的文化偏见，发现现有模型常倾向于全球北方的现代化表现，且I2I编辑削弱文化真实性，提出了可重复的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在填补对图像到图像编辑的文化偏见研究的空白，提供科学的评估方法和标准化的数据，以便实时监测和改进生成模型的文化表现。

Method: 使用标准化的评估框架，对六个国家的生成图像模型进行八类/三十六子类的文化偏见评估，结合自动化指标、文化感知的问答评估和本土评审的专家判断。

Result: 本文研究生成图像模型在文化表现上的不足，尤其是文本到图像（T2I）和图像到图像（I2I）系统的文化偏见。研究覆盖了六个国家，使用了八类/三十六子类的标准化评估框架，并基于时代感知的提示进行审计，得出了相对的比较结果。研究显示模型在国家无关的提示下偏向于全球北方的现代化表现，且I2I的迭代编辑会侵蚀文化真实性，即使传统指标得分不降反升；而I2I模型在调整时多采用表面线索未能有效体现历史背景和文化细节。根据这些发现，作者提供了一套可重复的文化中心基准，以评估和追踪生成图像模型中的文化偏见。

Conclusion: 研究揭示现行的生成图像模型在文化敏感度方面存在明显不足，特别是I2I编辑导致的文化失真问题，同时提供了改进这一领域的基准和工具。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [12] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现有图像到食谱检索方法存在偏见，忽略非视觉信息的重要性，本文提出的因果方法通过预测图像忽视的烹饪元素并融入表示学习，提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到食谱检索方法隐含假设食物图像能够全面捕捉食谱中以文本记录的细节，但食物图像仅反映烹饪菜肴的视觉结果，忽视了烹饪过程的细节。

Method: 该论文提出了一种新颖的因果方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽视的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式地注入跨模态表示学习，来减轻偏见。

Result: 在标准单语 Recipe1M 数据集和新创建的多语言多文化烹饪数据集上进行了实验，结果表明所提的因果表示学习能够识别细微的成分和烹饪动作。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法有效 uncover subtle ingredients and cooking actions，并在单语和多语多文化数据集上取得了显著的检索性能。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一种新的视频推理框架，整合了时空证据，显著提升了推理精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频推理模型仅生成文本推理痕迹，而未能指明关键证据出现的时间和地点，缺乏针对动态场景的时空联合跟踪及空间定位能力。

Method: 提出了一种新的视频推理模型Open-o3 Video，通过明确的时空证据来增强视频推理能力。

Result: Open-o3 Video在V-STAR基准测试中表现优异，mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%，并在多项视频理解基准上持续改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅在精度上达到最先进水平，还提供了有价值的推理痕迹，可以应用于测试时的验证和答案可靠性提升。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了 Endoshare，一款用于内窥镜手术视频的合并、标准化和去标识化的跨平台应用，旨在提升外科培训与研究的质量，同时解决隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础评估和外科数据科学可以促进外科培训、研究和质量改进，但由于录制格式多样和视频共享的隐私问题，广泛使用受到限制。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期的迭代用户中心反馈法进行开发，结合内部的临床医生与计算机科学家的调查以确定关键需求，以及外部临床医生的测试以评估可用性和采用情况。

Result: 经过初步和后续测试，外科医生和计算机科学家均报告出色的可用性和有用性感知，处理时间与处理模式、视频时长和机器计算能力相关联。

Conclusion: Endoshare 提供了一种透明、用户友好的标准化和隐私保护的外科视频管理流程，但需要进一步的合规认证和互操作性验证，才能作为现有专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了注意力卷积（ATConv），通过动态调节位置信息流和抑制冗余重新制定卷积运算，提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉骨架依赖自注意力（SA），但其二次复杂度限制了实际应用。卷积（Conv）尽管具有线性复杂度，却未能捕捉到SA的内在表现力。

Method: 提出了一种新的卷积运算形式：注意力卷积（ATConv）。

Result: ATConv在基本视觉任务上始终超越各种SA机制，且在图像分类中只需27M参数即可达到84.4%的ImageNet-1K Top-1准确率。

Conclusion: ATConv作为一种新型卷积操作，展现出超越传统SA机制的潜力，并在图像生成和分类任务中取得显著成果。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在生成图像方面取得了进展，但在合成手绘素描时仍面临挑战，因此需要开发新的框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 本研究通过微调变分自编码器和整合基于视觉问答的强化学习奖励函数，来提升模型生成素描的能力。

Result: StableSketcher生成的素描在与提示对齐的准确性上超越了Stable Diffusion基线，同时提出的SketchDUO数据集为手绘素描与文字描述的配对提供了新的资源。

Conclusion: StableSketcher通过优化变分自编码器和引入新奖励函数，显著提升了生成素描的风格保真度与文本图像一致性。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决自然语言监督在生物领域的应用受限问题，通过生成准确的描述性标题来增强模型的性能。

Method: 通过生成合成标题，利用多模态大型语言模型和维基百科信息，提升了标题与图像之间的对应关系，并有效训练生物基础模型。

Result: 本研究探讨了描述性标题作为生物多模态基础模型额外监督的来源。图片和标题可以视为来自物种潜在形态空间的互补样本，每个样本捕捉特定的生物特征。在训练中纳入标题有助于与共享潜在结构对齐，强调潜在的诊断特征，同时抑制伪相关。然而，主要的挑战在于大规模获得真实、个体特定的标题。这一要求限制了与其他科学领域相比，自然语言监督在生物学中的应用。我们通过生成合成标题来填补这一空白，利用多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs），并借助维基百科派生的视觉信息和特定于分类的格式示例。这些特定于领域的上下文有助于减少幻觉并产生准确的个体描述性标题。利用这些标题，我们训练了BIOCAP（即带标题的BIOCLIP），这是一个捕捉丰富语义的生物基础模型，在物种分类和文本-图像检索中表现强劲。这些结果表明，描述性标题在连接生物图像和多模态基础模型方面具有超越标签的价值。

Conclusion: 研究表明，描述性标题在提高生物图像与多模态基础模型之间连接的有效性方面发挥了重要作用。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度学习模型在开放世界应用中的可靠性，通过有效地利用模型的logit空间中的信息来改进OOD检测。

Method: LogitGap方法

Result: 在多种OOD检测场景和基准测试中，LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance。

Conclusion: LogitGap通过引入一种无训练的策略，能够自动识别最具信息量的logits，从而在OOD检测中展现出卓越的效果。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Result: 该方法能够从单个图像估计出自行车的3D平移和旋转，及其把手和踏板的旋转，显著提高了自行车姿态状态的估计准确性。

Conclusion: 与现有的基于刚性物体模板进行的6D姿态估计方法相比，我们的方法在准确性上取得了竞争性的成果。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

Conclusion: IB-GAN模型在不同数据集上表现优异，特别是在解耦表示和样本生成质量方面超越了现有的模型。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Method: 通过引入PPM模块，结合‘pick’和‘play’两个过程，以适应性地加权选择的帧进行时空聚合，从而实现高效的立体匹配。

Result: 该论文提出了一种基于记忆缓冲区的长程时空一致性建模方法，以解决立体视频中的深度估计问题，特别是提高增强现实中的用户沉浸感。通过引入P-P-记忆（PPM）构建模块，动态立体匹配得以实现，进而在准确性和时序一致性上达到了最先进的表现，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: PPMStereo在准确性和时序一致性上表现优越，相较于现有方法在Sintel数据集上取得了显著的性能提升，同时计算成本也更低。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 提出SPAN模型，通过连续回归捕捉怀疑意图的变化，相较于传统分类方法在安全监控中提高了早期检测与解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分类方法无法充分捕捉怀疑意图的连续变化，限制了安全监控的早期干预和解释性，因此需要更有效的模型来改善这一问题。

Method: 采用连续回归方法建模怀疑意图，定义得分公式并引入怀疑系数调制，对多模态信息进行调整。

Result: 本文提出的Suspicion Progression Analysis Network（SPAN）通过将不连续的分类方法转变为连续的回归方法，能够更好地捕捉怀疑意图的波动和变化。这种方法基于时间点过程（TPP）理论，揭示了怀疑具有长期依赖性和累积效应。通过定义怀疑得分公式，该文建模了持续变化并考虑时间特征。此外，引入怀疑系数调制，利用多模态信息调整怀疑系数，以反映可疑行为的不同影响。通过实验，SPAN在HAI数据集上显著优于现有方法，减少了19.8%的均方误差（MSE），并提高了1.78%的平均定位精度（mAP）。在低频情况下，该模型的mAP提升了2.74%，展示了其捕捉细微行为变化的能力。与离散分类系统相比，本文的连续怀疑建模方法在早期检测和主动干预上表现出更高的解释性和实用性，尤其在安全监测应用中具有重要意义。

Conclusion: SPAN模型在视频监控中，改进了怀疑意图的检测和解释能力，展示了比现有方法更高的性能。

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Motivation: 优化文本到视频生成中的用户提示，以提升生成效果

Method: 跨阶段提示优化框架

Result: RAPO++显著提高了语义对齐、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性，超越了现有方法

Conclusion: RAPO++是一个模型无关且高效的解决方案，为T2V生成中的提示优化设立了新标准。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有的文本图像编辑方法未能充分考虑编辑目标的语义差异，影响了编辑的效果和一致性，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FlowCycle使用一种基于流的无反演编辑框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化腐败，并通过循环一致性过程进行优化。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的基于流的编辑框架FlowCycle，其目标是改进文本到图像编辑方法中的中间状态构建。现有方法在重建源图像时，并未考虑特定编辑目标的语义差异，导致了编辑可操作性和一致性的限制。FlowCycle通过学习噪声参数化腐败过程，并通过循环一致性优化，创建出更具目标感知的中间状态，从而实现了在保持源图像一致性的同时进行的可信修改。实验结果显示，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性上优于现有的最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle通过引入目标感知的中间状态，可以更好地实现图像编辑，提升了编辑的质量与一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 提出了一种新的自监督学习框架CURL，用于从延长的胎儿超声视频记录中检测胎动。该方法采用了双重对比损失，结合空间和时间对比学习，学习稳定的运动表示。通过特定任务的采样策略，有效分离运动和非运动段，同时采用概率微调方法实现灵活推理。

Conclusion: CURL展示了自监督对比学习在胎动分析中的潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Result: 该方法在各项基准测试中均取得了一致且显著的改善，验证了其有效性和对背景依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了环境背景在长响应中的重要性，并提出了一种新方法以有效降低幻觉发生率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Result: 本文提出了一种新的视频时序定位方法DualGround，针对当前视频时序定位（VTG）任务中文本令牌统一处理的局限性，特别是对细粒度时序对齐能力的不足。通过对比实验，研究表明现有方法过于依赖全局语义，而未能有效使用逐词信号。为此，DualGround通过双支路架构分离全局和局部语义，利用文本的不同层次（句子级和短语级）来提高视频与语言的对齐效果。最终该方法在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上均取得了领先的性能。

Conclusion: DualGround通过结构性去耦语义建模，在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: HyperET在多个基准测试中一致性提升了现有的预训练和微调多模态大型语言模型，且额外参数量不足1%。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习点云压缩中的上下文建模不足和分布外数据处理效率低的问题。

Method: 提出了通用上下文模型和实例自适应微调策略，以提高压缩效率并处理分布外数据。

Result: 在 15 个多样化数据集上的广泛实验表明，AnyPcc 实现了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AnyPcc 在点云压缩领域设立了新的性能标杆。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种新的后训练量化方法AccuQuant，旨在解决扩散模型中的量化误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化误差在扩散模型的去噪步骤中会累积，对模型性能造成影响。

Method: AccuQuant通过在多个去噪步骤内最小化全精度扩散模型与其量化版本输出之间的差异，来解决误差累积问题。

Result: AccuQuant通过显式模拟扩散采样过程中多个去噪步骤来进行量化，显著降低了内存复杂度，并提升了算法的效果。

Conclusion: 实验表明，AccuQuant在各类任务和标准基准测试中都表现出了有效性和高效性。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本研究提出的PE-Field通过扩展位置编码，增强了Diffusion Transformers在3D空间中的几何建模能力，取得了新视角合成与空间编辑的最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现即使在位置编码扰动的情况下，图块令牌依然能够生成全局一致的输出，因此提出了PE-Field以更好地建模空间一致性。

Method: 提出了Positional Encoding Field（PE-Field），将位置编码从二维平面扩展到结构化的三维场，结合深度感知编码和分层编码。

Result: DiTs的图块令牌展现出惊人的独立性，空间一致性主要受位置编码的影响。

Conclusion: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成和可控空间图像编辑方面取得了卓越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

TL;DR: 本研究提出FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet模型，通过动态模糊逻辑驱动的知识蒸馏方法提升肺癌分类的准确性，克服传统模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对肺癌图像诊断中的不确定性与复杂性，提出一种有效的动态知识蒸馏方法以提高分类准确率。

Method: 使用模糊逻辑动态调整知识蒸馏权重，结合Vision Transformer和MobileNet进行训练，同时引入图像融合和基因算法选择适合的模型。

Result: 该模型在LC25000与IQOTH/NCCD数据集上的测试准确率分别达到99.16%和99.54%。

Conclusion: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet模型在多个影像数据集上表现出高达99.54%的准确率，证明了其在不同成像领域的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

TL;DR: Conan是一个用于视频推理的框架，通过识别上下文和证据帧、跨帧线索推理，提升了多步视频推理的能力，且在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的视频推理方法，解决文本链推理无依据和证据定位不准确的问题。

Method: 构建了Conan-91K数据集，并设计了结合识别、推理和行动的多阶段冷启动策略和RLVR训练框架。

Result: Conan在六个多步推理基准测试中，比基线方法的准确率平均提升超过10%。

Conclusion: Conan框架在多步视频推理中表现出色，超越了现有的基线方法，并在长视频理解任务中展现出良好的扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Motivation: 通过提高DAI的可靠性，使得FAS的公正性评估更加准确，减少偏差和方差。

Method: 采用模块化转移学习的方法，结合预训练的面部识别编码器和非线性分类头，构建DAI管道，并在准确性、公正性和稳健性三个维度上进行审计。

Result: 实验表明，提出的方法在多个数据集和训练设置上优于强基准，尤其在种族推断方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的DAI管道在公正性审计中提供了可靠的基础，尤其在对性别和种族推断时表现出色，促进了透明性和可重复性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

TL;DR: 提出双向概念蒸馏框架EchoDistill，实现文本到图像扩散模型的高效个性化与生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前一步模型难以有效捕捉新概念的分布，需要一种新的个性化方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多步骤扩散模型作为教师，与单步骤扩散模型作为学生，进行端到端的联合训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，EchoDistill框架在1-SDP设置下显著优于现有个性化方法。

Conclusion: EchoDistill提出了一种双向概念蒸馏框架，显著提高了文本到图像扩散模型的个性化能力，并提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Result: Metis-HOME显著提升了复杂推理能力，同时改善了模型的整体能力，逆转了其他推理专用模型的能力下降趋势。

Conclusion: Metis-HOME通过建立专门的专家分支，改善了复杂推理和一般理解能力，从而有效解决了推理与泛化之间的矛盾。

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Conclusion: 通过GenColorBench的评估，我们能够指导模型在精确颜色生成方面的改进，并将在接受后公开该基准。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频内容复杂且多样的理解挑战，尤其是在处理大规模语言模型时的计算限制与不一致推理问题。

Method: SeViCES采用无训练和模型无关的方式，通过两个关键模块进行工作：语义视觉共识帧选择(SVCFS)和答案共识精炼(ACR)。

Result: 在长视频理解基准上，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面均显著优于现有最新方法。

Conclusion: SeViCES在长视频理解基准测试中展现出色的准确性和稳健性，强调共识驱动的证据选择在视频大型语言模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的UltraHR-100K数据集和新方法显著改善了超高分辨率图像生成中的细节质量和整体保真度。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了	exttt{MixKV}方法，通过混合重要性和多样性，优化视觉-语言模型中的KV缓存压缩，从而提升模型的性能和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来，视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）在处理多模态序列方面展现出卓越的能力，但由于键值（KV）缓存的扩展造成了显著的内存瓶颈，限制了其部署的可扩展性。

Method: 分析LVLM中KV缓存的冗余特性，提出	exttt{MixKV}方法，根据头部的语义冗余情况，选择性地在压缩KV对时平衡多样性和重要性。

Result: 提出了一种新的方法	exttt{MixKV}，它将重要性与多样性相结合，优化LVLMs中的KV缓存压缩。

Conclusion: 在多项多模态理解基准测试中，	exttt{MixKV}在极端压缩情况下平均提升基线方法5.1%，并在特定任务上取得显著进展，同时保持相似的推理效率。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when

### [56] [ALICE-LRI: A General Method for Lossless Range Image Generation for Spinning LiDAR Sensors without Calibration Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20708)
*Samuel Soutullo,Miguel Yermo,David L. Vilariño,Óscar G. Lorenzo,José C. Cabaleiro,Francisco F. Rivera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI方法实现了无损范围图像生成，避免了信息损失，适用于各种LiDAR传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动导航、环境监测和精密制图中，3D LiDAR传感器生成的大量点云需要有效处理，以避免信息损失和几何不一致性。

Method: 算法通过反向工程任何旋转LiDAR传感器的内在几何，推断激光束配置、角分布和每束校准修正，进行无损投影和完整点云重建。

Result: ALICE-LRI是一种通用的传感器无关方法，实现了从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损范围图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件。

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI有效地解决了点云处理中的信息丢失问题，并在实时性能下实现了几何无损性，对高精度远程传感应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AutoScape框架，通过RGB-D扩散模型和视频扩散模型生成高质量的长时段驾驶视频且提高了一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在生成真实且几何一致的长时段驾驶场景，解决现有方法在生成视频时的长范围几何一致性问题。

Method: 采用RGB-D扩散模型生成稀疏的、几何一致的关键帧，并通过视频扩散模型进行插值以生成密集的视频帧。

Result: 与之前的最先进技术相比，长时段FID和FVD评分分别提高了48.6%和43.0%。

Conclusion: AutoScape显著提升了长时段生成驱动视频的质量和一致性。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: 动态位置外推（DyPE）是一种新方法，可使扩散变换器在超高分辨率下生成图像，超过训练分辨率，且表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何解决扩散变换器在超高分辨率图像生成时的训练成本问题，尤其是自注意力机制的平方扩展性所带来的挑战。

Method: DyPE通过在每个扩散步骤动态调整模型的位置编码，匹配其频谱与生成过程的当前阶段，从而充分利用扩散过程中的频谱进展。

Result: 提出了一种新的训练无关方法——动态位置外推（DyPE），该方法使得预训练的扩散变换器能够以超出其训练数据的分辨率合成图像，且不增加采样成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个基准测试中表现优越，在超高分辨率图像生成中达到了最先进的保真度，特别是在更高分辨率时效果更为显著。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MeanFlow的成功并解决其优化冲突与收敛速度慢的问题

Method: 介绍$	ext{α-Flow}$目标函数

Result: $	ext{α-Flow}$模型在多个规模和设定上都优于MeanFlow，并在使用新状态下达到最新的FID分数

Conclusion: $	ext{α-Flow}$通过分解目标函数解决优化冲突，实现了更好的生成表现。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

TL;DR: Cupid是一种新型基于生成的3D重建方法，从单个2D图像中准确推断出相机姿态、3D形状和纹理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一个能够从单一2D图像推断3D信息的高效方法，以提升3D重建的准确性和视觉效果。

Method: Cupid通过学习的3D对象分布将3D重建视为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流程匹配管道。

Result: Cupid在PSNR和Chamfer Distance上显著优于现有3D重建方法，同时在姿态精度和视觉真实感上也表现卓越。

Conclusion: Cupid在3D重建领域表现优异，超过了其他领先方法，并在视觉真实感上超越了基线模型。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 提出一种新的多目标跟踪框架，旨在通过融合雷达和相机数据来提高跟踪效率，且减少手动干预。

Conclusion: 通过实验证明，该框架能够有效提高目标跟踪的精度，并简化雷达-相机映射过程。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的基于自回归生成的图像分割框架ARGenSeg，显著提高了分割精度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了克服现有方法在细粒度视觉细节捕捉上的限制，我们提出了一种基于图像生成的分割框架。

Method: 通过图像生成的分割框架，将MLLM用于输出视觉标记，并使用通用VQ-VAE将其解码为图像，依赖于MLLM的像素级理解。

Result: 通过引入下一尺度预测策略并行生成所需的视觉标记，减少了推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个分割数据集上超过了之前的最先进方法，显著提高了推理速度，同时保持了强大的理解能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉-语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，主要体现在关键线索的精确定位和多跳推理的整合。

Method: 提出了一种名为Speculative Verdict (SV)的训练无关框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和一个大型裁决模型来进行推理。

Result: SV在多个高难度的信息密集型视觉问答基准上取得了一致性提升，包括InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K。

Conclusion: SV通过合成来自多个部分准确推理路径的正确洞见，在错误校正和成本效率上优于大型专有模型或训练管道。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: SpectraMorph是一种新颖的自监督融合框架，通过物理模型来提高高光谱图像的空间分辨率，并在各种数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在处理低带宽多光谱图像时的不可解释性和性能不足的问题。

Method: 提出一种名为SpectraMorph的物理导向自监督融合框架，使用结构化潜在空间进行超分辨率融合。

Result: SpectraMorph能够提取低分辨率高光谱图像中的端元特征，并通过多层感知器预测类似丰度的图，表现出优越的性能。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph不仅提高了高光谱图像的可解释性和训练效率，还在不同数据集上 outperform 了现有的基准方法，显示出良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Result: 在多视角生成3D形状、图像超分辨率和多视角场景合成等任务中，LDDBM显示出强大的性能和稳定性。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在多种模态翻译任务上取得了显著的效果，建立了新的强基准。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Result: 通过广泛的实验，证明 LayerComposer 在空间控制和身份保留方面优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: LayerComposer 在多主体个性化图像生成中，比现有最先进的方法提供了更好的空间控制和身份保留。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Result: 本研究提出了DeBERTa-KC，这是一种基于transformer的模型，旨在自动分类在线科学学习话语中的知识构建（KC）级别。通过收集四个流行YouTube科学频道（2022-2024）的评论，创建了一个包含20,000个手动标注样本的平衡语料库，涵盖四个KC类别：非KC、分享、探索和协商。所提模型在DeBERTa-v3的基础上扩展了Focal Loss、标签平滑和R-Drop正则化，以解决类别不平衡问题并增强泛化能力。实现了一个可重复的端到端流程，包括数据提取、标注、预处理、训练和评估。在10折分层交叉验证中，DeBERTa-KC取得了$0.836 \\pm 0.008$的宏F1分数，显著优于经典和transformer基线（$p<0.01$）。每个类别的结果表明，对更高阶的知识参与表现出较高的敏感性，尤其是在探索和协商话语中。这些发现表明，大型语言模型能够有效捕捉非正式数字学习环境中知识构建的细微指标，为话语分析和评估知识参与的自动化工具开发提供了可扩展的理论指导方法。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，DeBERTa-KC模型在捕捉知识构建设计方面是有效的，并为话语分析和自动化工具的开发提供了一个理论支持的方法。

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

Motivation: 探索五种大型语言模型生成的课程计划的教学有效性及可用性，以优化教育工具。

Method: 评估AI生成课程计划的有效性和可用性

Result: 不同模型和提示框架生成的课程计划在可读性、准确性及与课程标准的对齐上表现各异。

Conclusion: 选择合适的模型与提示框架组合，可以提升课程计划的可读性与教育效果，特别是结合RACE框架。

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models

*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparse Tracing是一种新技术，通过动态稀疏注意力高效分析长文本的注意力模式，克服传统方法的内存限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型上下文规模的扩大，传统的机制可解释性技术面临着内存需求激增的挑战，急需高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为Stream的编译层次修剪算法，能以接近线性时间和线性空间估计每个头的稀疏注意力掩码。

Result: Stream在RULER基准上表现出色，保留关键信息路径，同时大幅减少不必要的交互。提供了一种在不需要庞大缓存的情况下分析注意力模式的实用工具。

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing使得在消费者级GPU上实现链式思维监控的长文本可解释性成为可能，推动了这一领域的普及。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

TL;DR: 本研究提出一种新颖流程，利用大型语言模型分析电子健康记录文本，以提高HIV筛查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高HIV的筛查和早期诊断效率，利用电子健康记录中的非结构化数据。

Method: 利用大型语言模型分析非结构化电子健康记录文本，评估患者进行HIV检测的资格。

Result: 实验结果显示，所提流程在高准确率下保持了较低的假阴性率。

Conclusion: 所提方法在临床数据上展示了良好的性能，为HIV筛查提供了一种新的技术手段。

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了11个大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的表现，发现存在虚假信息风险，但在解释质量和简单任务上提供了一定的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在生命周期评估中的应用，填补评价标准缺失的空白。

Method: 对11个LLMs进行了评估，17位专家针对科学准确性、解释质量、鲁棒性等22个生命周期评估相关任务进行了审查。

Result: 经过评估发现，37%的模型输出包含不准确或误导性信息；小型模型在准确性和解释质量上表现一般或良好；一些模型的幻觉生成率高达40%。

Conclusion: 提高模型在生命周期评估中应用的安全性与有效性需制定评估机制，普通用途的LLMs需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

TL;DR: 本文提出通过Dixit游戏对多模态大型语言模型进行综合评估，结果表明游戏中胜率和传统基准高度一致，而人类与模型的对比则揭示了模型的改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有的多模态大型语言模型(MLMs)的能力时，通常采用静态或单一的基准，这些基准无法全面反映模型的能力。此外，传统的比较方法主观性强并且容易出现模型利用表面特征来提高胜率的问题。

Method: 利用Dixit这一卡牌游戏设计评估框架，量化实验中对五个不同的多模态大型语言模型进行评估，比较游戏胜率与现有基准的关系以及人类玩家的表现。

Result: 通过提出基于游戏的评估方法，能够全面且客观地评估多模态大型语言模型的能力。具体通过Dixit游戏，发现模型的胜率排名与现有基准高度相关，同时揭示了人类玩家与模型之间的策略差异。

Conclusion: 基于游戏的评估方法不仅提升了模型评估的客观性和趣味性，也为模型的进一步优化提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法依赖领域专家将现实问题转化为可解决的数学模型，LLMs可通过自然语言理解和代码生成简化此过程。

Method: 本研究使用了基准评估、幻觉分类法以及多种缓解策略，包括LLM作为评审者、少样本学习、工具调用和多智能体框架，系统评估DeepSeek-R1的表现。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在多个运筹学基准测试中表现良好，具有成本效益高的特性，但在具体应用中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1模型在运筹学应用中显示出良好的潜力，但仍需进一步探索其在实际场景中的有效性。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个基于记忆的框架，利用大语言模型和批评意见提高分类准确率，强调其在学习动态中的作用和策略调整的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，传统的微调方法面临成本高、灵活性差等问题。本研究旨在探索一种更高效的学习方式，利用记忆和批评意见来提升模型在目标分类任务中的表现。

Method: 该研究采用增强记忆的框架，通过情节记忆和语义记忆的结合，分析模型在处理标签与批评之间的差异，通过实证评估考察不同模型表现，提出新的可建议性指标进行深入解释。

Result: 本研究探讨了基于预训练大型语言模型的智能体如何在不更新参数的情况下，通过标签示例学习目标分类功能。我们提出一个增强记忆的框架，利用标签数据和大模型生成的批评意见，来永久存储特定的经验。该框架通过情节记忆存储具体案例的批评意见，通过语义记忆将这些信息提炼为可重用的任务级指导。在多种任务中，结合批评意见的方式相较于仅依赖标签的检索基线（RAG风格）表现出多达24.8%的准确率提升。研究中还发现OpenAI和开源模型在处理以事实导向和偏好导向的数据时存在明显的行为差异。为了解释模型对存储在记忆中的不同监督表现的响应，我们引入了一种新颖的指标，称为“可建议性”，这有助于解释观察到的行为，并揭示模型特征与记忆策略如何共同影响学习动态。我们的发现突显了基于记忆驱动的反思学习在构建更具适应性和可解释性的LLM智能体方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该项研究表明，基于记忆驱动的学习方法能够显著提升LLM智能体的准确率和适应性，尤其是在处理不同类型的监督信息时，记忆策略的选择至关重要。

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

Motivation: 针对传统歌词翻译方法受限于手工规则和句子建模的局限性，LyriCAR旨在提高翻译的连贯性和质量。

Method: 该框架使用一种困难意识课程设计和适应性课程策略，以优化训练过程和资源分配。

Result: LyriCAR是一个针对歌词翻译的控制框架，能够在无人监督的情况下有效处理多种音乐约束，提升段落级别的翻译质量，并显著减少训练步骤。

Conclusion: LyriCAR在歌词翻译领域的实验中展现了最先进的性能，证明了其在处理复杂翻译任务中的优势。

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

Result: 这篇论文探讨了一种混合方法，结合了大型语言模型（LLMs）与符号自然语言理解（NLU）系统的优点。通过使用LLMs进行重述和文本简化以及填补知识空白，作者实现了广泛的覆盖范围。同时，符号NLU被用于生成在推理和增量学习中可用的结构化关系表示。经过在提取和解释常识科学文本中的量和因果法则的任务评估，该方法明显优于仅使用符号NLU的管道。

Conclusion: 混合方法显著提高了常识科学文本的提取与解释能力，表明结合LLMs与符号方法的可行性与有效性。

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

Conclusion: 这些新模型在下游任务中的表现显著优于现有基线，证明了所提出方法的有效性。

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

Result: 提出的模型和方法能够显著提升在序列标记任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 预训练神经语言模型在序列标记任务上表现最佳时需通过针对性迁移学习进行适应。

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

Motivation: 解决现有工具集的冗余性和模糊性问题，提升大型语言模型在复杂任务中的工具选择准确性。

Method: ToolScope采用ToolScopeMerger进行工具合并的自动审计和修复，和ToolScopeRetriever对相关工具进行排名与选择，以优化工具集使用。

Result: 本文提出了ToolScope以解决大型语言模型（LLM）在使用外部工具时面临的冗余和模糊性问题。ToolScope包含两个主要组件：ToolScopeMerger用于自动审计和修复工具合并，从而减少冗余；ToolScopeRetriever用于对每个查询进行排名和选择，压缩工具集以适应输入上下文限制，同时保证选取工具的准确性。经过在三个先进LLM和三个开源工具使用基准测试的评估，ToolScope显示出8.38%到38.6%的工具选择准确率提升，证明了其在提高LLM工具使用方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ToolScope显著提升了大型语言模型在复杂任务中的工具选取准确率，解决了工具冗余和上下文限制的问题。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially

Result: 训练后的模型在医学推理能力上显著优于其前身，尽管所用数据集较小，显示出训练方法的高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: 通过专注于推理能力的训练方法，本研究在欠代表性语言的领域特定语言模型开发中取得了显著的进展，尤其是在医学问答任务中。

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为CreativityPrism的新框架，以评估大型语言模型的创造力，结果显示专有和开源模型表现差异显著，且不同任务间的创造力表现存在领域特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大型语言模型（LLMs）创造力的评估缺乏整体框架，存在碎片化问题，导致不同领域和任务的评估标准差异较大。

Method: 提出CreativityPrism评估分析框架

Result: 通过CreativityPrism评估17个最先进的LLMs，发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距；各任务在同一领域内的模型表现高度相关，而不同领域间相关性较弱；多样性和质量指标表现出强相关性，而新颖性与其他两者的相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 结果支持了创造力并非单一固定理念的假设，强调了对LLM创造力进行全面评估的必要性。

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统实体链接方法对大规模注释数据集和深度微调的依赖问题，提高效率与性能。

Method: 通过智能组合候选生成、上下文评分、适应性路由及选择性推理，ARTER能够高效处理简单和复杂的实体链接任务。

Result: 在6个数据集中的5个上，ARTER的方法平均提升了2.53%，并且在效率上是现有方法的两倍。

Conclusion: ARTER在标准基准上表现优于现有方法，同时在计算效率上也具有显著优势。

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本复杂性的增加，传统的分段方法已难以满足需求，因此开发新方法以提升文本处理效率和质量显得尤为重要。

Method: BoundRL方法使用了一种强化学习与可验证奖励机制相结合的方式，通过生成起始标记和重构内容的技术来进行文本分段。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为BoundRL的新方法，针对结构化文本进行有效的分段和标签预测。此方法通过生成起始标记序列来减少推断成本，并利用可验证奖励的强化学习优化生成内容的语言模型。此外，BoundRL通过构建中间候选项来提升模型效果，最终在复杂的生成式AI提示任务中显示出优越性能。

Conclusion: BoundRL在处理复杂的结构化文本方面展示了其优越性，特别是在与大模型的比较中，表现突出的成果。

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现，站位检测相关的偏见未受到足够重视，尤其是在政治倾向相关任务中。

Method: 通过自动注释已有的站位检测数据集，标注与特定群体相关的方言或俗语以及文本复杂性/可读性，来分析这些属性对模型决策的影响。

Result: 研究结果表明，大型语言模型在站位检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，例如错误地将支持大麻的观点与低文本复杂性关联。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在站位检测任务中表现出显著的刻板印象，这影响了模型的判断和决策。

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

TL;DR: 研究表明，虽然LLMs在简单的空间推理任务中表现尚可，但在提升复杂度后，其性能显著下降，展示出其在空间表示上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型(LLMs)在文本输入下的空间推理能力，尤其是它们在处理不同复杂度空间任务时的表现。

Method: 通过一系列五个任务评估模型的空间理解和计算能力，这些任务包括象限识别、几何变换、距离评估、单词搜索和拼图滑动，并通过增加网格维度来提高任务复杂度。

Result: 大型语言模型在小规模复杂任务中表现中等，但随着规模的增加，性能迅速下降，准确率降低平均达42.7%，最高可达84%。

Conclusion: 本文强调了LLMs在语言与空间推理之间的差距，为未来在语言和几何交叉领域的集成基准奠定基础。

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨在语言模型推理中，使用无需生成的采样策略来近似边际化，提高计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的边际化方法因大量可能的分词而复杂，传统采样成本高，本文旨在寻找更高效的采样方式。

Method: 通过对多种开放模型的实验，评估无需解码的采样策略的近似质量与计算速度。

Result: 现代语言模型在处理子词分词文本时，旨在平衡模型大小、推理速度和词汇覆盖率。尽管汽车在推理时仅通过输出的特定分词来评估模型概率，但实际上，针对同一文本，有许多不同的子词词汇表示方式。最近的研究建议通过边际化评估大型语言模型（LLMs），即考虑给定文本所有可能分词的概率总和。由于文本的分词方式种类繁多，边际化变得困难，因此常通过采样实现近似边际化。然而，采样的缺点在于每次生成样本时，LLM需要执行一个代价高昂的生成步骤，这限制了在运行预算下能获取的样本数量，进而影响近似的准确性。因此，我们探索了一种无需解码的采样策略，这些策略不需要LLM生成内容，而是完全依赖极其便宜的采样策略，且对模型和分词器无关。经过多种开放模型的测试，我们发现无需解码的采样策略在小运行成本下提供了足够准确的边际估计，并在一系列下游推理任务中证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 无需解码的采样策略显著提高了边际化的近似质量和速度，适用于各种下游推理任务。

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）经常同时发生，并伴随相关症状，这使得自动评估变得复杂，通常以二元和特定障碍的方式进行。临床上有效的诊断需要考虑严重程度的跨障碍评估和决策支持解释。

Method: 将访谈文本、音频和面部信号相结合，使用经过校准的晚期融合分类器，输出每种障碍的严重性概率和特征级归因。

Result: 通过统一的三模态情感严重度框架同步和融合访谈文本、音频和面部信号，输出抑郁症和PTSD的分级严重性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情感临床决策提供了可重复的评估和临床支持，尤其在处理多种共存障碍时表现出色。

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

Motivation: 解决现有基于token的预测限制，提升模型对高层语义和长距离上下文关系的捕获能力。

Method: 引入下一上下文预测目标，训练模型学习多标记上下文的预测表示，利用来自未来标记块的误差信号。

Result: 在GPT2和Pythia模型上进行的大规模实验表明，ContextLM在困惑度和下游任务表现上均有显著改善。

Conclusion: ContextLM框架通过下一上下文预测提升了语言模型的性能，特别是在长距离连贯性和注意力分配方面，展示了更好的效果且计算开销较低。

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: 结合生成功能、注意力机制和检索方法可有效提升LLM的引用质量，为进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

Motivation: 由于表格问答任务面临诸如大量无关信息和领域特定推理等独特挑战，探讨PRMs在此领域的效果显得尤为重要。

Method: 通过对最先进的生成PRMs在表格问答任务中进行评估，分析其在答案和步骤方面的表现。

Result: 本研究首次系统地探讨了过程奖励模型（PRMs）在表格问答（TQA）中的应用，发现现有PRMs在处理TQA时存在一定的局限性，尤其是在处理与领域无关的数据时，并且步骤验证的性能与答案准确性之间的关联较弱。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结合文本和代码验证的PRMs在选择解决方案时能够提供帮助，但在领域外数据的泛化能力较弱，现行PRMs在TQA上存在明显的局限性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在结构化数据推理中的评估，尤其是考虑数据集污染的影响。

Method: 通过一系列受控探测实验，研究了大型语言模型在广泛使用的表格基准上的先前知识。

Result: 发现数据集中的强语义线索导致污染效应，而当这些线索被移除或随机化时，模型的表现急剧下降。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型表面上的能力在一定程度上反映了对公开数据集的记忆，而不是真正的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

Motivation: 探索否定文本对大型语言模型幻觉现象的影响

Method: 通过构建NegHalu数据集，开展实验探讨LLMs在处理否定文本时的幻觉检测能力

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs在否定文本上有效检测幻觉的能力较差，常产生逻辑不一致或不可靠的判断

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了LLMs在处理否定输入时的局限性，并指出了缓解这些问题的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Motivation: 尽管BERT在多种任务中表现优异，但其架构已显得过时，因此提出更新的模型以提升性能，特别是在希伯来文处理方面。

Method: 介绍NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual的训练过程及其在各个基准上的表现。

Result: NeoDictaBERT和NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在几乎所有希伯来基准测试中超越现有模型，且NeoDictaBERT-bilingual在检索任务中显示出强劲成绩。

Conclusion: 我们发布这些模型以支持希伯来文NLP研究与开发的进一步进展。

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

Method: 通过教师-学生框架，使用新的对齐数据集进行后续训练，改进多轮对话中的应急性。

Result: 本文介绍了ContingentChat，一个旨在评估和改善儿童与照顾者之间多轮对话中应急性的教师-学生框架。BabyLM模型训练于1亿个单词，使用新的对齐数据集进行后续训练，生成的响应在语法和连贯性上更加出色。实验结果表明，自适应教师解码策略的附加收益有限。ContingentChat展示了针对性后续训练对对话质量的益处，并表明应急性仍然是BabyLM面临的一项挑战。

Conclusion: 应急性在BabyLM中仍是一个具有挑战性的目标，但有针对性的后续训练可以提升对话质量。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

Motivation: 解决低质量指令遵循数据在稀缺情况下的信息损失问题，提升指令调整大语言模型的性能。

Method: 通过构建MIXTURE数据集，并结合LM-Mixup方法进行监督微调和强化学习优化，使用三种奖励信号对模型进行优化。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为Instruction Distillation的任务，旨在将多个低质量冗余输入提炼为高质量连贯的指令输出对。通过创建MIXTURE数据集，该数据集结合了144K个低质量指令集和其高质量提炼结果。接着，作者提出LM-Mixup方法，通过对MIXTURE进行监督微调，并利用强化学习进行优化，结合三种互补的奖励信号，包括质量、语义对齐和格式合规性。实验结果表明，LM-Mixup在增强不完善数据集方面极为有效，其提炼数据集（仅占全数据集的约3%）比完整数据集训练效果更佳，并且与当前最先进的高质量数据选择方法在多个基准测试上表现相近。

Conclusion: 低质量数据在经过合适的提炼和增强后，成为了一种有价值的资源，提升了指令调整大语言模型的表现。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

Result: 通过四种置信度估计方法进行评估，发现混合CoCoA方法的表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同的不确定性度量方法各自捕捉模型置信度的不同方面，混合方法提供了最佳的可靠性和校准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在评估时行为调整的问题，以提升安全性评估的有效性。

Method: 使用两步训练过程，首先进行继续预训练，随后进行专家迭代训练，以引导模型行为。

Result: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在评估时可能表现出评估意识，并通过添加引导向量调整其行为，以提高安全评估的可靠性。研究表明，应用引导技术可以抑制模型的评估意识，使其在评估过程中表现得像是在实际部署中。通过两步训练，首先让模型学习评估意识行为，然后使用专家迭代训练，使得该模型在评估环境中更频繁地使用Python类型提示。最终发现，引导激活可以消除评估意识，使模型在存在评估提示时也能表现得像在部署。

Conclusion: 引导模型行为可以有效提高大型语言模型在安全评估中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

Motivation: 本研究动机在于解决LLM在特定个体需求下的表现不佳问题，特别是在偏好覆盖差距导致模型处理细微差别时的表现不稳定。

Method: 鲁棒偏好选择（RPS）是一种后处理方法，通过利用方向邻域共识，从相关偏好的局部邻域中采样多个响应，以建立更优的候选池。

Result: 本论文提出了一种新的方法——鲁棒偏好选择（RPS），旨在解决大语言模型（LLM）在用户偏好对齐方面的局限性，尤其是当用户的需求具有细微差别时。通过利用方向邻域共识，RPS能够在没有重新训练模型的情况下，从其他相关偏好中采样多个响应，从而提高响应的选择质量。实验结果显示，RPS在不同对齐范式下显著提升了模型的稳健性。

Conclusion: RPS方法为增强用户偏好对齐模型的可靠性提供了理论支持和实际应用，能够更好地满足用户的多样化需求。

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的检索增强生成（RAG）方法在多步骤问题和异构证据源上存在脆弱性，需要在准确性、延迟和资源预算之间进行权衡。

Method: 通过将文档、表格和知识图谱线性化为可逆层次序列，并进行结构感知的迭代来收集必要证据，最终生成答案。

Result: 提出了层次序列（HSEQ）迭代框架，增强了异构问答能力，展示了在多个基准测试上相比于传统RAG方法的显著性能提升。

Conclusion: HSEQ优于传统方法，具备格式无关性、预算意识的迭代及证据规范化等三大优势，能够提升问答一致性和可审计性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的上下文压缩方法ARC-Encoder，通过压缩上下文至连续表征以提高LLM的推理效率，并在多个测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有技术在推理过程中的成本较高，探索不需要调整目标模型或者改变其架构的上下文压缩方法。

Method: 使用编码器压缩上下文为连续表征，替代解码器中的标记嵌入。

Result: 设计了一种名为ARC-Encoder的可适应文本表征压缩器，能够输出的连续表征数量较文本标记少$x$倍，并在多个基准测试上实现了最先进的性能，同时提高了推理时的计算效率。

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder是一个灵活高效的解决方案，可以无缝适配多个解码器，提升了LLM的应用效率。

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

Motivation: 探讨语言模型在处理句子时，是进行语法分析还是依赖已知语义关系。

Method: 通过设计包含中心嵌入句子的理解问题，结合可行与不可行句子的比较，测试模型在复杂度增加下的表现。

Result: 模型在句子复杂度增加时，表现出对可行与不可行句子的理解差异，且在因果推理问题上，语义合理性可能会降低表现。

Conclusion: CenterBench提供了评估语言模型结构分析与语义关联转变的基础框架。

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

Motivation: 解决现有多跳问答中缺乏全球规划和执行不可靠的两个基本限制。

Method: 通过将问题分解为子目标，协调检索与推理，并利用奖励机制引导整个过程。

Result: GlobalRAG在多个基准测试中的表现显著优于强基线，训练数据使用量仅为强基线的42%，但在EM和F1上平均提升了14.2%。

Conclusion: GlobalRAG在多跳问答中有效提升了推理质量和检索能力，显示出良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Result: MACDF在JD搜索平台上的应用表明，其在推荐系统的转变上具有实际效益。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的多智能体认知决策框架（MACDF）能显著提高推荐准确性和用户满意度，特别是在处理复杂查询时。

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of

### [114] [Can ChatGPT Code Communication Data Fairly?: Empirical Evidence from Multiple Collaborative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20584)
*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了ChatGPT在沟通数据编码中的偏见，结果显示其对性别和种族组别没有显著偏见，适合大规模评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大规模的沟通与合作依赖于将沟通数据分类的繁琐任务，现有研究证明ChatGPT能够按照编码标准对沟通数据进行分类，且准确性媲美人类评估者。

Method: 采用典型的协作问题解决编码框架，分析来自谈判、问题解决和决策三类协作任务的数据。

Result: 研究发现ChatGPT的编码在性别和种族组别上没有显著偏见，这为其在大规模沟通与合作评估中的应用铺平了道路。

Conclusion: ChatGPT能够有效编码沟通数据，并在性别和种族上没有显著偏见，适合进行大规模应用。

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

*Haoyu Wang,Sihang Jiang,Yuyan Chen,Yitong Wang,Yanghua Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）能否像人类一样进行好奇驱动学习，并设计了评估框架来测量这些模型的好奇心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类好奇心与大型语言模型之间的关系，探讨LLMs的学习能力与创新潜力。

Method: 通过设计包括信息寻求、刺激寻求和社交好奇等多个维度的评估框架，基于人类好奇心评估问卷对LLMs进行评估。

Result: 研究结果表明LLMs在好奇驱动的行为中能够增强推理和主动学习能力，展现出与人类相似的好奇心潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs展现出比人类更强的知识渴望，但在不确定环境中仍然表现出保守的选择。

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

*Junghyun Min,York Hay Ng,Sophia Chan,Helena Shunhua Zhao,En-Shiun Annie Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CantoNLU是针对粤语自然语言理解的新基准，涵盖多项任务，并比较了不同模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于政策和双语现象，粤语虽然有数百万人使用，但资源仍然不足。

Method: 我们建立了一个涵盖句法和语义的基准，并评估了多种模型的性能。

Result: 我们提出了CantoNLU，一个涵盖七项任务的粤语自然语言理解基准，提供了几种模型的基线性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，适应粤语的模型整体表现最佳，而单语模型在句法任务上表现更好。

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出神经多样性作为一种减少语言模型幻觉的机制，并通过ND-LoRA验证其有效性，发现其能够显著降低幻觉率，且不影响整体准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言模型的参数、计算能力和数据量不断增加，但它们仍然出现幻觉现象。

Method: 通过组合并行LoRA适配器和Barlow Twins正则化，提出 ND-LoRA 方法，并进行了因果干预和相关分析以验证神经多样性对幻觉率的影响。

Result: 通过引入神经多样性这一新机制，能够在固定的参数和数据预算下减少语言模型的幻觉率。

Conclusion: 神经多样性是改善语言模型可靠性的第三个维度，与参数和数据量正交，不同任务需要不同程度的最优神经多样性。

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了最小贝叶斯风险(MBR)解码在对话和指令执行等开放性任务中的应用，提出了三种轻量级的效用函数适应方法，以提高MBR对结果空间结构变化的敏感性，并通过实验验证了这些方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高MBR在更开放性任务中的效果，使其在选择生成响应时更具针对性。

Method: 引入三种轻量级适应的效用函数，并在包含对话行为、情感和响应结构等潜在结构的数据集上进行测试。

Result: 与常用相似性基础效用函数相比，提出的适应方法在实际指令跟随基准上证明了其提高了生成质量，胜率提升高达13.7个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过提出的效用函数适应方法，MBR在生成质量上有显著提升，展示了其在结构敏感性方面的优势。

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了多种NLP方法提取氟嘧啶治疗和毒性信息，发现LLM方法表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提取在临床笔记中嵌入的氟嘧啶类药物的治疗和毒性信息，因其广泛用于结直肠癌和乳腺癌的治疗，但存在手足综合征和心脏毒性等副作用。

Method: 使用自然语言处理（NLP）方法提取治疗和毒性信息，涉及规则基础、机器学习、深度学习和大型语言模型（LLM）等多种方法。

Result: 通过80:20的训练-测试分割，LLM方法表现最优，error-analysis prompting在治疗和毒性提取上实现最佳精度、召回率和F1分数（F1=1.000）。

Conclusion: LLM基础的NLP方法最有效地从临床笔记中提取氟嘧啶的治疗和毒性信息，对肿瘤研究和药物警戒有重要支持潜力。

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型推理模型在机器翻译质量评估中的应用，提出了一种通过合成训练进行思维校准的方法，以提高评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRM作为机器翻译评估工具的潜力，解决其在评估过程中遇到的挑战。

Method: 通过训练LRM在合成的人类思维轨迹上进行思考，以减小其思考负担并提高评分准确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，经过校准的LRM在WMT24指标基准测试中的评估性能显著提高，同时思考预算减少约35倍。

Conclusion: 经过校准的LRM能有效提升机器翻译评估的精准性，展示了LRM在自动评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

TL;DR: 本研究构建了一个针对特定AI应用的公平性评估数据集，帮助识别大语言模型的潜在差距，并为研究社区提供了具体资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型（LLMs）的方法多集中于文本生成等高层任务，缺乏针对具体AI应用的评估，无法有效评估公平性等责任AI维度。

Method: 构建针对实际应用的公平性评估数据集

Result: 构建了一个以现实应用为驱动的数据集，该数据集通过公平性属性与性别形容词和产品类别交叉参数化，生成了一组丰富的标记提示，展示如何利用这些数据识别LLMs中的质量、真实性、安全性和公平性差距。

Conclusion: 所提议的数据集为评估大语言模型在公平性和其他责任维度上的表现提供了新的思路和具体工具，有助于进一步的研究和应用。

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合模型，通过直接访问过去的token来解决线性注意模型在信息检索任务中的遗忘问题，与多种复杂度的token混合器结合使用，以提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 线性注意模型在信息检索任务中表现不佳，主要由于其有限的记忆导致的信息遗忘问题。

Method: 探讨了一系列混合模型，结合稀疏注意机制和可学习的token驱逐方法，使用滑动窗口注意力和轻量级CNN来保持临界KV对。

Result: 结合滑动窗口注意力的学习驱逐方法和稀疏注意机制，保持了线性注意的时间和空间复杂度，同时增强了对过往token的访问能力。

Conclusion: 实证评估结果表明，所提出的方法在检索密集型基准测试中有效。

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少长上下文在检索增强生成中的计算成本，探索有效的压缩策略。

Method: 提出了一种简单的均值池化方法用于上下文压缩，并训练同一压缩器生成多个压缩比。

Result: 均值池化方法在各类QA数据集上表现最佳，即使在不同的压缩比下也保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 均值池化方法在性能上优于现有的压缩代币架构，且在训练多个压缩比时下降幅度较小，显示复杂的压缩方法表现差异。

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

TL;DR: 大语言模型生成文本的检测面临定义不一致和多样性带来的挑战。检测结果应仅作为参考，不应被视为绝对指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员希望通过该研究明确LLM生成文本的检测范围及其在实际应用中的有效性，以推动更准确的检测方法的发展。

Method: 文章未详细描述具体方法，但重点在于讨论当前检测技术的局限性及定义不清的问题。

Result: 本文讨论了大语言模型（LLMs）生成文本的检测问题，指出目前对于"LLM生成文本"的定义不一致，且不同的使用场景和LLMs的多样性增加了检测的难度。关键在于，许多被认为是检测目标的文本仅仅是LLMs可能生成文本的一个子集。LLM生成的文本经过人类编辑，以及LLM对用户的微妙影响，使得LLM生成文本与人类创作文本之间的界限变得模糊。目前的基准和评估方法未能充分考虑现实应用中检测器工作的多种条件，因此检测器的数值结果常被误解，其重要性正在减弱。因此，尽管检测器在特定条件下仍然有效，但其结果应仅作为参考，而非决定性指标。

Conclusion: 检测器在特定条件下仍有用，但应谨慎解读其结果，避免误解。

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型如何影响用户观点，并研究用户输入如何影响LLM响应，特别是在多轮对话中的双向影响。

Method: 通过对266名参与者在50个争议话题下进行对话，比较静态声明、标准聊天机器人和个性化聊天机器人对意见的影响。

Result: 研究发现人类观点变化微小，而LLM输出变化显著，且个性化设置增加了这种变化。

Conclusion: 人类与LLM交互中的过度一致性风险，以及设计个性化聊天机器人时需谨慎考虑用户的必要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Method: 基于家庭与AI互动的学习原型设计与测试

Result: 通过FamLearn原型的应用，提升了家庭成员间的贡献认知和任务分配效率，减轻了照顾者的负担，丰富了共享学习体验。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅可作为教育辅导工具，更能作为家庭学习的协调者，促进责任分配与代际参与，增强家庭学习关系。

Abstract: Family learning takes place in everyday routines where children and
caregivers read, practice, and develop new skills together. Although AI is
increasingly present in learning environments, most systems remain
child-centered and overlook the collaborative, distributed nature of family
education. This paper investigates how AI can mediate family collaboration by
addressing tensions of coordination, uneven workloads, and parental mediation.
From a formative study with families using AI in daily learning, we identified
challenges in responsibility sharing and recognition of contributions. Building
on these insights, we designed FamLearn, an LLM-powered prototype that
distributes tasks, visualizes contributions, and provides individualized
support. A one-week field study with 11 families shows how this prototype can
ease caregiving burdens, foster recognition, and enrich shared learning
experiences. Our findings suggest that LLMs can move beyond the role of tutor
to act as family mediators - balancing responsibilities, scaffolding
intergenerational participation, and strengthening the relational fabric of
family learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雷达图在特征值幅度差异大时的可视化清晰度问题。

Method: 使用组合优化的方式，结合字典序最小最大标准对特征进行重排。

Result: 通过排列优化，该方法显著改善了雷达图的视觉平衡性和信息表达。

Conclusion: 提出了一种排列优化策略以提高雷达图的视觉清晰度，减少多重轮廓间的多边形"尖锐性"。

Abstract: Radar charts are widely used to visualize multivariate data and compare
multiple profiles across features. However, the visual clarity of radar charts
can be severely compromised when feature values alternate drastically in
magnitude around the circle, causing areas to collapse, which misrepresents
relative differences. In the present work we introduce a permutation
optimization strategy that reorders features to minimize polygon ``spikiness''
across multiple profiles simultaneously. The method is combinatorial
(exhaustive search) for moderate numbers of features and uses a lexicographic
minimax criterion that first considers overall smoothness (mean jump) and then
the largest single jump as a tie-breaker. This preserves more global
information and produces visually balanced arrangements. We discuss complexity,
practical bounds, and relations to existing approaches that either change the
visualization (e.g., OrigamiPlot) or learn orderings (e.g., Versatile Ordering
Network). An example with two profiles and $p=6$ features (before/after
ordering) illustrates the qualitative improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高人机交互的自然性和有效性，弥补传统多模态接口中用户情感信息处理的不足。

Method: 采用了一种商业面部表情识别服务，捕捉并集成用户的非语言情感信号，并对系统进行初步评估。

Result: 本研究提出了一种名为“共情提示”的新框架，用于丰富大型语言模型（LLM）对话的人机交互，特别是引入隐含的非语言上下文。该系统整合了一种商业面部表情识别服务，以捕捉用户的情感线索，并将其作为对话提示过程中的上下文信号。不同于传统的多模态界面，共情提示不需要用户的显性控制，而是无需干扰地将情感信息与文本输入相结合，从而提高对话的连贯性和流畅性。该架构是模块化和可扩展的，允许集成其他非语言模块。我们描述了通过本地部署的DeepSeek实例实现的系统设计，并进行了初步的服务和可用性评估（样本量N=5）。结果显示，非语言输入与LLM输出的一致集成，参与者强调了对话的流畅性。除了这一概念验证，共情提示还指向了在聊天机器人媒介交流中的应用，特别是在医疗或教育等领域，用户的情感信号至关重要，但在言语交流中往往不够明确。

Conclusion: 共情提示为チャット机器人在医疗或教育等领域的应用提供了新的可能性，其对用户情感信号的处理能提高人机交互的质量。

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

*Junfeng Gong,Zhiyi Wei,Junying Chen,Cheng Liu,Huawei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个训练-free的框架，通过结合小型语言模型与大型模型的推理能力，提升CUDA代码生成的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CUDA编程和领域特定库发展迅速，但有效利用GPU仍具有挑战性。大型语言模型在生成优化代码方面展现潜力，但隐私和计算成本问题促使对更轻量级的小型语言模型产生浓厚兴趣。

Method: ReGraphT整合CUDA优化轨迹并建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索，不依赖于训练过程。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为ReGraphT的框架，旨在提升小型语言模型（SLMs）在CUDA代码生成中的表现，通过重用大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，克服SLMs在复杂场景下的推理不足。ReGraphT将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，并利用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）进行高效探索，同时设计了一个针对CUDA的基准评估，以评估模型在不同推理复杂度上的表现。实验结果表明，ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval测试中达到了平均2.33倍的加速，比高性能计算特定的微调模型更为优越。

Conclusion: ReGraphT通过创新的结构化推理图和高效的搜索策略，使小型语言模型在CUDA优化任务中取得接近大型语言模型的性能，同时减轻了隐私风险和计算开销。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的公平意识的强化学习方法FairGRPO，旨在减少医疗AI系统在不同人口群体中的表现差异，并在多个临床数据集上取得了显著进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对医疗人工智能系统在不同人口群体间表现不平衡的问题进行研究，特别是其对少数群体造成的实质性伤害。

Method: 提出了一种名为公平意识组相对策略优化(FairGRPO)的分层强化学习方法，以促进异质临床人群之间的公平学习。

Result: FairGRPO在7个临床诊断数据集上减少了27.2%的预测差异性，同时提高了F1得分12.49%。

Conclusion: FairMedGemma-4B展示了在保证公平性的同时，提升了临床诊断的整体性能，减少了不同人口群体之间的差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究噪声数据集对分类方法的影响，强调低信噪比、小样本量和数据收集错误等问题的重要性。

Method: 通过将经验数据集视为潜在随机场的结果，利用Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève展开对随机特征进行构建和计算，最终实现噪声数据集的分类。

Conclusion: FINDER在阿尔茨海默病阶段分类和遥感森林砍伐检测中表现出色，同时讨论了其优势、局限性及预期表现。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在持续学习中线性回归任务顺序的影响，提出了一种贪心策略以最大化连续任务之间的差异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在持续学习中任务顺序对模型性能的影响，尤其是贪心策略下的任务排序。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法的工具，对贪心排序进行了形式化描述，并建立了几何与代数直觉。

Result: 实证结果表明贪心排序在平均损失方面收敛更快，理论分析显示不同排序方式下的损失界限存在差异。

Conclusion: 贪心任务顺序的收敛速度优于随机顺序，而在不同的排序策略下两者的表现呈现出细微差异。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的无偏梯度估计器，克服了零阶优化方法中的偏差问题，并在多个任务中显示出优越的准确性和收敛性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

Motivation: 探讨现有研究中固定长度扰动的局限性，提出方向对齐的扰动以提高梯度估计的准确性。

Method: 将问题形式化为对扰动分布的受约束的函数优化问题，进行理论与经验性质的研究。

Result: 本文探讨了双点零阶梯度估计器，识别出随机扰动的分布，通过最小化估计器的渐近方差来优化。研究表明，所需的扰动可以与真实梯度在方向上对齐，而不是固定长度。这一方向对齐的扰动（DAP）方案在关键方向上具有更高的准确性，并且我们还为使用$	heta$-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降提供了收敛分析。实验结果表明，在特定条件下，DAP相较于传统方法有显著优势。

Conclusion: DAP方案在关键方向上具备更高的准确性，并在合成问题和实际任务中有效超过传统方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机平滑方法使用均匀的噪声分布，未能考虑输入数据和维度的异质性，限制了模型的对抗性认证效果。

Method: 通过将对称噪声分布转换为非对称噪声分布，并引入了噪声参数生成器来优化噪声参数，UCAN为不同数据维度提供了定制化的防御措施。

Conclusion: UCAN方法在多种数据集上的实证评估表明，与现有最先进的方法相比，其认证准确率提升显著，证明有效。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习方法在时间序列预测中表现卓越，但现有模型在训练过程中学习到大量冗余特征，影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出一种名为自适应掩蔽损失与表示一致性的创新解决方案（AMRC），包含动态掩蔽损失和表示一致性约束。

Result: 实验结果表明，AMRC方法有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: AMRC方法能有效抑制冗余特征学习，提高时间序列预测模型的性能，为时间建模提供了新的理论视角和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过RFID跟踪技术提高国防资产的存储安全性并解决传感器特异性问题

Method: 使用监督学习和决策树分类进行RFID跟踪模型的模拟

Result: 模型在分类12个实验室区域方面具有34.2%的总体准确率和0.40以上的F1评分，但稀有类别（如LabZoneC）常常被错误分类

Conclusion: RSSI基础的决策树可以用于国防供应链的区域级异常检测，但需要优化天线布局及传感器融合以增强可靠性。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

Conclusion: SALT通过精细的优势分配显著提升了强化学习算法在复杂任务中的表现，并可无缝集成于现有系统中。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Result: CTAE在两个高密度电生理数据集上表现出色，能够更好地解码行为变量。

Conclusion: CTAE有效地提取了有意义的表示，改进了行为变量的解码能力。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer
encoders and decoders to capture long-range neural dynamics and explicitly
partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

TL;DR: ShapeX框架通过分析shapelets提升时间序列分类模型的解释能力，尤其在关键应用中效果显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增加时间序列分类模型的透明度和信任，尤其是在医疗和金融等高度关键的应用中

Method: 提出ShapeX框架，利用Shapley值评估时间序列中有意义的shapelet驱动段的显著性

Result: ShapeX框架在识别相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精确性和因果信度

Conclusion: ShapeX提供了更具因果关系的解释，突破了传统时间步骤级特征归属方法的局限，优化了时间序列分类光环。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新的加权维度距离度量方案，并成功地将其应用于KNN分类器，显著提升了分类准确性，尤其是在基因表达数据集上。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Motivation: 解决现有原型自监督学习方法中原型部分崩溃的问题，防止多个原型收敛于相似的表示形式。

Method: 采用高斯混合模型，对原型进行独立更新，使用在线EM风格程序，与编码器的损失无关。

Conclusion: 提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略，有效消除了原型崩溃现象，提供了一致性更强的多样化原型，并提升下游性能。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了填补时间序列基础模型与传统模型之间的性能差距，促进其更好地泛化和推理。

Method: 提出了一种从第一原则出发的ontology构建方法，旨在确保时间序列的不变性被系统性覆盖。

Result: 该论文分析了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在性能上与轻量级监督基线和经典模型之间存在的差距，指出这一差距源于简单地借鉴自然语言处理和计算机视觉的处理流程。由于时间序列数据的构建无法有效捕获人类概念，导致在这一领域的模型无法如同语言和视觉中的数据那样获取丰富的语义信息。为了解决这一问题，作者建议应从偶然的数据聚合转向原则性的设计，构建系统性涵盖时间序列不变性的数据库，以确保表示的完整性和时间语义的保留。只有通过这种方式，时间序列基础模型才能获得必要的结构，以实现更好的泛化和推理能力。

Conclusion: TSFMs的进步依赖于基于第一原则构建涵盖不变性的时间序列数据库，以实现更好的表示能力和推理能力。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Method: 通过多层图扩散模型分析长期神经影像数据，研究结构连通性和功能连通性的相互作用。

Result: 发现功能连通性在皮质下区域和额颞叶区域主导tau传播，而结构连通性在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域发挥更大作用，且这种主导地位随着疾病的进展而变化。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了结构连通性和功能连通性在阿尔茨海默病中影响tau蛋白扩散的相互作用，指出两者在不同大脑区域的主导作用及其随疾病进程的变化。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，ADP-VRSGP在多个场景中显著优于现有基准。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP有效提升了去中心化学习的训练稳定性和速度，同时在隐私保护方面提供了个性化保障。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有的基于正确性的奖励方法未能充分考虑任务重要性的问题，提出RLEV以提升模型的价值导向表现。

Method: 将人类定义的价值信号直接整合入奖励函数中，利用带有明确人类价值标签的考试样式数据进行训练。

Result: RLEV在多个RL算法和模型规模中表现超过基于正确性的基线，并有效地实现了价值导向的终止策略。

Conclusion: RLEV通过整合人类定义的价值信号，强化了大语言模型的价值对齐机制，表现出在低噪声和高噪声价值信号下均具备优越性。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在符合适当约束资格的条件下，为原始的受限问题提供准确的等价，并实现算法收敛。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

Motivation: 本文旨在探索在可复制性强烈限制下，哪些近似的可复制性概念下仍然能够实现学习的可能性。

Method: 通过提出点对点、一致性和半可复制的三种放松，对比分析学习算法在不同模型下的表现。

Result: 本文探讨了算法在重新抽样输入下的稳定性，即可复制性，其代价可能非常昂贵。研究提出了三种可复制性的自然放松版本，针对PAC学习中的应用分别为：1. 点对点一致性；2. 大多数分布一致性；3. 半可复制，允许使用共享未标记样本。这三种情况下，针对恒定可复制参数，文中给出了样本最优的无偏PAC学习算法。

Conclusion: 根据三种不同可复制性的放松，本文展示了如何实现样本最优的PAC学习算法，并讨论了各自对样本需求的影响。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

Motivation: 开发便捷的筛查工具用于早期犬类癌症检测是兽医学中的一项重大挑战，常规实验室数据作为低成本的筛查工具受到关注，但具有指标的非特异性和类间不平衡的问题。

Method: 通过分析Golden Retriever Lifetime Study (GRLS)队列的数据，比较126种分析管道，包括机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术，以评估癌症风险分类的效果。

Result: 最优模型Logistic回归分类器在区分癌症的能力上表现一般，具有一定的负预测值，但临床分类表现不佳，且预测结果受到非特异性特征的驱动。

Conclusion: 研究确认常规实验室数据中的癌症信号虽然可检测，但由于强干扰，无法支持可靠的临床分类，未来需要整合多种数据来源以实现更有效的癌症检测。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Conclusion: CO-PFL通过动态贡献评估和个性化机制，显著提高了个性化联邦学习的效果，克服了传统方法的不足，展示了其在准确性、鲁棒性以及收敛稳定性方面的优势。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

*Teng Jiek See,Daokun Zhang,Mario Boley,David K. Chalmers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过提出层对层知识混合方法，显著提高了GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性，同时几乎不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GNN是预测分子性质的有效方法，但目前的模型在准确性上仍有提升的空间，而提高模型复杂性会增加计算成本和内存需求。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的自知识蒸馏方法，称为层对层知识混合（LKM），通过最小化GNN层的隐藏嵌入之间的平均绝对距离来实现。

Result: LKM在使用多种GNN架构（DimeNet++、MXMNet和PAMNet）和量子化学性质数据集（QM9、MD17和Chignolin）评估中，能够将预测的量子化学和生物物理性质的平均绝对误差降低至最高9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM能够显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性，同时几乎不增加训练和推理的计算成本。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

### [159] [What Does It Take to Build a Performant Selective Classifier?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20242)
*Stephan Rabanser,Nicolas Papernot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 选择分类器通过不处理不确定的输入来提升可靠性，然而很少有方法达到完美排序标准。通过识别五个松弛来源，并进行实验验证，提出量化的误差预算和设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进模型的可靠性，使选择性分类器能够在不确定的输入上 abstain，从而提升性能，然而目前的实用方法未能达到完美排序的标准。

Method: 通过形式化选择分类差距，提出五个不同的松弛来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实施或偏移引起的松弛。

Result: 通过在合成的两个半月数据及真实世界的视觉和语言基准上验证分析，确认了贝叶斯噪声和模型能力受限可以显著影响选择分类的性能，只有更丰富的特征感知校准能够有效提升分数排序，同时数据转移引入了独立的松弛，要求进行分布稳健训练。

Conclusion: 建立选择分类器需要有效的评分机制，不仅仅是重新调整分数，以更接近理想的oracle行为。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过提出FedGPS框架，研究了在数据异构情况下提升联邦学习鲁棒性的方法，验证了其在多种异构场景下的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在不同异构场景中鲁棒性不足的问题，通过全面的评估来揭示这一点。

Method: 通过共享统计信息和梯度信息来动态调整客户端的学习目标和局部更新方向。

Result: FedGPS通过集成他人的统计分布和梯度信息，提高了客户端的学习效果和全局视角。

Conclusion: FedGPS在各种异构场景中表现优于现有最先进的方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

### [161] [Optimistic Task Inference for Behavior Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20264)
*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种新方法，通过与环境互动推断任务，减少BFMs对数据的依赖，能够快速有效地识别和优化奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统BFM在推断过程中对大量数据的依赖，以及在计算效率上带来的挑战，本文提出了通过环境交互进行任务推断的新方式。

Method: 提出了一种乐观决策标准，建模奖励函数的不确定性，并导向BFMs的数据收集。通过理论分析和实证验证，展示了该方法的有效性。

Result: 本文介绍了一种名为OpTI-BFM的新型行为基础模型(BFM)，旨在通过在测试时与环境的互动来推断任务，克服BFM在数据需求上的限制。该模型采用乐观决策标准来处理奖励函数的不确定性，并为BFM的数据收集提供指导。通过与线性乐观算法的直接联系，本文为经过良好训练的BFM提供了一个后悔界限的公式化。实验证明，OpTI-BFM能在有限的实验中快速识别和优化未见的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM能够显著提高行为基础模型在零-shot强化学习中的效率，降低数据需求，实现快速的任务推断。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到拓扑特征能够捕捉成像数据中的全局几何结构，但在深度学习中的实际应用需要计算效率和可微性。

Method: 使用优化的CUDA内核针对Ampere GPUs进行了Euler特征曲线计算，并实现了在PyTorch中可微分的层，以实现单向阈值学习。

Result: 通过优化的GPU内核实现了Euler特征曲线的高效计算，并提出了一个可微分的PyTorch层，支持端到端学习。

Conclusion: 优化后的CUDA内核和可微分PyTorch层可广泛用于深度学习的各种应用，促进了拓扑特征在这一领域的采用。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

### [163] [Limits of PRM-Guided Tree Search for Mathematical Reasoning with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20272)
*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中的效果，发现其表现不佳，需改进奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过强化树搜索方法改善大型语言模型在数学推理中的性能，解决当前线性结构的不足。

Method: 提出了一种自适应算法，用于探索树搜索中多条部分解决路径，并对借助过程奖励模型（PRM）进行分析。

Result: 本研究提出了一种自适应算法，用于在复杂问题解决中最大化过程奖励模型（PRM）分数，探索多条部分解决路径，以提高大型语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理方面的能力。通过对23个不同数学问题的研究，发现PRM引导的树搜索在统计上并未显著优于最佳选项（BoN），尽管成本更高。此外，蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索在性能上超越了其他PRM引导的树搜索方法，且PRM在推理深度增加时的可靠性下降，且在分布外的泛化能力较弱。这些结果表明，在树搜索有效提升LLMs的数学推理能力之前需要不同的奖励建模。

Conclusion: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中未显示出显著优势，需要改进奖励建模以提高效果。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本研究提出SynTSBench评估框架，以应对深度学习模型在时间序列预测中的评价和选择挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在时间序列预测中表现不稳定的问题，并改善现有评估框架的不足。

Method: 通过编程特征配置系统地评估时间序列预测模型的能力，包含时间特征分解、鲁棒性分析和理论最佳基准等三大分析维度。

Result: 提出了一种新的评估框架SynTSBench，能够系统地评估时间序列预测模型的基本建模能力。

Conclusion: 现有的深度学习模型在不同的时间特征类型上并未普遍接近最佳基线，需要更全面的评估体系。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出基于 KAN 的协作模型（KCM），改善大型-小型模型的协作框架，显著降低计算资源消耗，同时提高任务准确性，特别是在长尾数据上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大型-小型模型协作框架中存在的准确性下降、灾难性遗忘和幻觉问题.

Method: 提出一种基于 KAN 的协作模型（KCM）作为改进的大型-小型模型协作框架.

Result: KCM 在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中的实验结果显示，其在保持近乎相同任务准确率的同时，显著降低了大型模型的推理调用次数，减少了计算资源消耗，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，特别是对长尾数据的准确性提升显著。

Conclusion: KCM 在各项指标上相比于基于 MLP 的小型协作模型（MCM）表现出更优的性能，证明了其在大型-小型模型协作中的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: 希望通过建立科学研究的新基准，推动AI系统在计算机科学研究中的实际应用。

Method: 构建CS-54k问答对语料库，进行检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制，输出两个子集用于训练和评估。

Result: 本研究提出了一种将大型语言模型（LLMs）应用于科学研究的愿景，构建了一个名为ResearchGPT的AI协作系统。为实现这一愿景，需建立严谨的基准评估科学研究过程中各个相互依赖的阶段，而非孤立的子任务。为此，研究贡献了一个名为CS-54k的高质量计算机科学问答对语料库，该语料库由14000篇CC授权的论文构建，采用一种可扩展的纸质基础流程，结合了检索增强生成（RAG）和多阶段质量控制，以确保事实的准确性。通过该语料库衍生出两个互补的子集：CS-4k作为评估AI辅助科学研究能力的基准，CS-50k作为大规模训练数据集。大量实验证明，CS-4k能够将最先进的LLM按能力分级，而在CS-50k上经过监督学习和强化学习训练的开放模型显示出显著的提升。即使是7B规模的模型，在适当训练后也能超越许多大型专有系统，如GPT-4.1、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro。这表明，提高AI模型作为研究助手的能力更多依赖于与领域对齐的高质量数据训练，而非预训练规模或一般基准性能。研究团队发布了CS-4k和CS-50k，以期促进AI系统作为计算机科学研究中的可靠合作者。

Conclusion: AI模型作为有效的科学研究助手，其改善更多依赖于领域特定的高质量数据训练，而非单纯的模型规模或一般性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned
training with high-quality data than on pretraining scale or general benchmark
performance. We release CS-4k and CS-50k in the hope of fostering AI systems as
reliable collaborators in CS research.

TL;DR: 本文提出的InvDec架构通过结合时间编码和变量解码，显著提升了高维多变量时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在时间建模和变量相关性建模之间的折衷问题，提出更有效的多变量时间序列预测方法。

Method: InvDec是一种混合架构，结合了基于补丁的时间编码器和通过变量自注意力进行操作的反向解码器。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，InvDec-PatchTST在高维数据集上显著提升了预测性能，尤其在电力数据集上实现了20.9%的均方误差降低。

Conclusion: 提出的InvDec架构有效结合了时间编码和变量级解码，特别是在高维数据集中表现更佳。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

Motivation: 保护用户隐私，满足动态的多敏感属性遗忘需求。

Method: 提出LEGO，一个轻量级的多属性遗忘框架。

Conclusion: LEGO在三种真实数据集上验证了其有效性和效率，并具有理论上的保障。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 针对夜间图像这种未在真实数据中代表的恶劣条件，使用定制的领域适应策略能够提高模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Conclusion: 提出的基于不确定性的路由框架有效地结合了快速奖励模型和强大的LLM评判者，使得在在线RLHF中提高了性能和效率。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Result: 提出了一种考虑协方差矩阵估计不确定性的稳健优化框架，并在数值实验中显示出优越的预测性能

Conclusion: 通过引入不确定性集并将重整问题转化为半正定优化问题，提供了一种有效的层次时间序列预测方法

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 本文提出相对基础概率(RBP)度量，提出新的相对基础缩放法则，强调相对排名对于语言模型性能的重要性，并通过多次实验验证其准确性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缩放法则主要依赖于交叉熵作为评价指标，而交叉熵无法全面反映语言模型的性能，因此需要从相对排序的角度进行研究。

Method: 通过引入RBP度量，研究模型大小与模型性能之间的关系，并在多种数据集和模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的相对排序的缩放法则，强调了在语言模型中相对排名的重要性，并引入相对基础概率(RBP)度量，以有效预测模型性能。在多种数据集和模型族上进行了广泛实验，证实了该法则的鲁棒性和准确性。该法则不仅补充了现有的交叉熵视角，还为语言模型的缩放提供了更全面的理解。

Conclusion: 相对基础缩放法则为理解大型语言模型提供了更深入的视角，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

TL;DR: 本文讨论了直接偏好优化（DPO）算法在使用偏好数据进行模型微调时的缺陷，并提出了AuxDPO算法以改善DPO的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨DPO的局限性及其在处理偏好数据时的失败模式，并寻找改进方案以提高模型对齐的有效性。

Method: 通过引入额外的辅助变量到DPO损失函数中，AuxDPO有助于在策略空间中向RLHF解决方案迈进，从而缓解DPO的错误指定问题。

Result: AuxDPO有效解决了DPO算法中的偏好顺序颠倒和政策奖励恶化的问题，表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO在教学式赌博机设置和大型语言模型对齐任务中展现了优越的性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有研究忽视的事件标记分布不平衡问题，尤其是稀有标记的预测挑战，提出相应的解决方法。

Method: 开发了一种新颖的神经MTPP模型，通过阈值调整标记概率，并先预测标记再预测时间，在不需复杂积分的情况下有效进行时间采样和标记概率估计。

Result: 通过大量实验证明了所提方法在多个基准上的优越性，更好地预测下一个事件的标记和时间。

Conclusion: 提出的阈值方法显著提高了下一个事件的标记和时间预测性能，尤其是在处理稀有标记时。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在实际应用中产生有毒或偏见输出的问题，增强安全性和信任度。

Result: 提出并评估了五种代表性的样本选择方法，发现SAPS在去毒化、保持效用和效率之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 选择性修复作为一种高效可扩展的方式，对维持大型语言模型的可靠性至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Conclusion: 可解释基准测试能够自动生成解释，帮助用户理解系统性能。PruneCEL在这方面表现优异，能有效提高与用户的交互理解。

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Motivation: 面对标签稀缺的场景，传统的半监督学习和基于预训练模型的微调方法存在模型偏差和超参数敏感性的问题。

Method: Bi-CoG方法结合了模型间和模型内一致性，采用动态伪标签分配策略来降低偏差和提高伪标签质量。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的半监督微调方法Bi-CoG，通过同时利用模型间和模型内的一致性来提高伪标签质量，降低偏差。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG方法在14个数据集上的实验证明了其有效性，显著提升了现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Motivation: 推动人工智能在遥感领域的应用，提高对稀有且重要雨量事件的检索性能。

Method: 通过将标签分布的不平衡分解为零膨胀和长尾，以障碍模型和逆模型的方式进行学习和检索。

Result: 这项研究提出了Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL)框架，旨在解决人工智能在定量遥感中因标签分布不平衡导致的性能问题，特别是对稀有样本（如重雨）的检索性能下降。通过将雨水分布的不平衡分解为零膨胀和长尾两个成分，使用障碍模型处理零膨胀问题，同时IMDL旨在通过将学习对象转变为无偏理想逆模型来解决长尾问题。经过统计指标和案例研究的全面评估，IMDL显示出比传统和其他学习方法在检索重雨方面的显著优势。

Conclusion: IMDL提供了一种针对环境变量分布不平衡问题的通用方法，能够增强对稀有且高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

Conclusion: SheafAlign通过去中心化方法实现有效的多模态对齐，证明其在零样本泛化及跨模态鲁棒性方面的优越性能。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

Conclusion: 该方法在多个推理问题上超越了现有的先进技术，证明了其在处理更大和更复杂问题时的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Conclusion: 通过对期望光滑性条件的处理，本研究统一并扩展了最近的一些相关研究，提供了明确的收敛速率和残差误差的界限。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Conclusion: 结合群体智能和可解释机器学习有助于乳腺癌的可靠诊断，提升生存率。

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出BadGraph，揭示文本引导图生成中的后门攻击，显示低污染率即可实现高攻击成功率，强调模型应用中的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞引发的新安全隐患亟需研究，特别是在文本引导图生成领域。

Method: 通过向训练数据中添加文本触发器进行污染，实现后门攻击，并进行了一系列实验以评估攻击成功率和对良性输入性能的影响。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为BadGraph的后门攻击方法，针对文本引导的图生成中的潜在扩散模型。该方法利用文本触发器对训练数据进行污染，秘密植入后门，从而在触发器出现时引发攻击者指定的子图，而在干净输入上保持正常性能。实验结果显示，低于10%的污染率能实现50%的攻击成功率，24%的污染率则可以超过80%的成功率，同时对良性样本的性能影响微乎其微。消融研究进一步揭示了后门是在VAE和扩散训练期间植入的，而非预训练。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了文本引导图生成中潜在扩散模型的安全漏洞，强调了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险，并呼吁加强针对后门攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的MS-BART模型，通过多任务预训练和化学反馈机制提高质谱数据的处理性能，解决了分子幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决质谱数据中结构阐明的挑战，尤其是在注释谱稀缺的情况下，提升分子识别的准确性和效率

Method: MS-BART模型框架，结合大规模预训练和多任务学习，处理质谱数据和分子结构的映射

Result: MS-BART在MassSpecGym和NPLIB1的关键指标上达到了SOTA性能，处理速度比其他基于扩散的方法快一个数量级，同时验证了模型的有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 尽管MS-BART在现实光谱变异性下仍需进一步调整，但其整体性能优势和快速处理能力使其成为质谱分析领域的有效工具。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了一种快速有效的算法，该算法在无须微调的情况下，通过少量矩阵的检查和少量样本评估，使预训练语言模型适应新任务，且提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提高大型语言模型（LLMs）在下游任务中的适应能力和准确性，同时降低计算成本。

Method: 通过减少矩阵搜索范围、利用奇异值的梯度信息、扩大因子分解搜索空间以及只使用100个样本来进行微调，以降低计算开销。

Result: 本文提出了一种名为Layer-SElective-Rank reduction (LASER) 的方法，用于提高下游任务的准确性，同时避免了基于梯度的微调。然而，LASER方法的逐层遍历搜索耗时较长。我们演示了如何消除这一开销，并发现只需检查少量特定矩阵，利用矩阵的奇异值梯度标识出需要减少的矩阵。通过扩大因子分解搜索空间，进一步减轻了过拟合并提高准确性。此外，仅用100个样本进行计算的方式也能显著减少搜索时间，这表明下游任务的适应性受提示风格而非数据集大小的主导。因此，我们展示了结合这些发现的快速和强健的适应算法，能够在无需微调的情况下，将LLMs适应于新数据集。

Conclusion: 结合对矩阵和样本的有效选择，提出的算法无需微调即可快速适应新的下游任务，显著提高了模型精度。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 在差分隐私转移学习中，最佳超参数的选择受到梯度分布变化的影响，现有启发式方法对于批处理大小的调优效果不佳。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

Method: 提出了一种新算法H-SPLID，通过显式地将显著特征与非显著特征分解到不同空间中来学习显著的特征表示。

Result: H-SPLID在图像分类任务中表现出显著的提升，模型主要依赖显著输入组件，对非显著特征的扰动（如背景）表现出较低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID有效地提升了模型在任务相关特征学习中的低维性和鲁棒性，减少了对非重要特征的敏感性。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Motivation: 了解大脑功能并应用于脑机接口需要从神经元群体活动中解码视觉刺激，但缺乏足够的生物数据，尤其是在灵长类动物或人类中，传统的高通量记录技术难以应用。

Conclusion: MEIcoder展示了在早期视觉系统中可靠解码的可行性，为神经科学和神经工程应用提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Result: xTime在多个数据集上实现了预测准确率的显著提升，特别是在极端事件上，从3%提高到78%。

Conclusion: xTime通过有效利用低稀有事件信息和动态选择专家模型，显著增强了极端事件预测的能力。

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

*Anna Mészáros,Patrik Reizinger,Ferenc Huszár*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究训练了一个270M参数的国际象棋Transformer，并分析其在系统性推广上的表现。结果表明，该模型在遵循国际象棋基本规则和生成高质量走法方面表现出色，但在复杂变体上仍不及传统符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨现代决策Transformers在复杂游戏中对于规则理解的能力，以及它们在面对变体和不在训练数据中的场景时的表现。

Method: 我们训练了一个270M参数的国际象棋Transformer，并测试其在分布外场景中的表现，以揭示系统推广的失败之处。

Result: 模型展示了良好的组合性推广能力，能够在不同于训练数据的情况下依然选择有效走法，但在复杂变体如Chess960中表现不如传统符号AI。

Conclusion: 尽管Transformer展示了强大的规则外推能力和基本的策略适应性，其在变体游戏上的表现仍有待提高，尤其是在符号AI算法的对比中。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

TL;DR: 反向和正向KL散度在强化学习中的作用并不如直觉所示，提出了一种新算法以提高样本质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨反向和正向KL散度在强化学习中的应用，评估它们对采样多样性的影响。

Method: 分析了反向和正向KL散度的影响，并设计了一种新的算法，通过调整目标分布来提升采样质量和多样性。

Result: 提出一种简单、可扩展且理论上有依据的算法，在不改变奖励幅度的情况下，优化目标分布以提高高质量采样模式的概率。

Conclusion: 算法在实验中有效提高了大型语言模型和化学语言模型的解的质量和多样性，且适用于正向及反向KL散度。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文探讨了信息融合的协同转变及其在资源约束下生成holonic结构的潜力，展示了其优势与应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出信息融合的概念演变，从传统的层级方法向更适合民用和边缘组织的协同方法转变，体现出新的融合需求和技术进步。

Method: 基于多agent系统模型对holon的形成进行研究，通过实例展示了其操作潜力。

Result: 探讨如何在资源受限的情况下生成holonic结构，并展示其在多agent系统中的应用实例。

Conclusion: holonic结构因其适应性、自主性和协作能力，在资源短缺和系统失效的情况可以有效应对挑战。

Abstract: There has recently been a major advance with respect to how information
fusion is performed. Information fusion has gone from being conceived as a
purely hierarchical procedure, as is the case of traditional military
applications, to now being regarded collaboratively, as holonic fusion, which
is better suited for civil applications and edge organizations. The above
paradigm shift is being boosted as information fusion gains ground in different
non-military areas, and human-computer and machine-machine communications,
where holarchies, which are more flexible structures than ordinary, static
hierarchies, become more widespread. This paper focuses on showing how holonic
structures tend to be generated when there are constraints on resources
(energy, available messages, time, etc.) for interactions based on a set of
fully intercommunicating elements (peers) whose components fuse information as
a means of optimizing the impact of vagueness and uncertainty present message
exchanges. Holon formation is studied generically based on a multiagent system
model, and an example of its possible operation is shown. Holonic structures
have a series of advantages, such as adaptability, to sudden changes in the
environment or its composition, are somewhat autonomous and are capable of
cooperating in order to achieve a common goal. This can be useful when the
shortage of resources prevents communications or when the system components
start to fail.

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

TL;DR: 开发了一种量子启发式算法，通过矩阵乘积状态（MPS）有效解决QUBO问题，展示其在数独和MaxCut等应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决二次无约束二进制优化问题，这些问题在数学上等价于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态。

Method: 提出并评估一种量子启发式算法

Result: 算法有效识别各类QUBO实例中的全局最小值，并成功解决中级数独和MaxCut问题。

Conclusion: 此量子启发式方法具有良好的可扩展性和通用性，非常适合工业规模的QUBO应用。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

Motivation: 为解决能源领域中缺乏标准化推理评估框架的问题，确保人工智能分析的逻辑完整性和政策一致性。

Method: 本研究通过建立分析可靠性基准，合成多个指标，对各类模型在相同条件下进行系统性比较和验证。

Result: 本研究提出了一种名为分析可靠性基准（ARB）的框架，用于评估人工智能和机器学习在能源系统分析中的推理可靠性。该基准整合了五项子指标：准确度、推理可靠性、不确定性管控、政策一致性和透明度，通过使用开放的技术经济数据集，评估模型在确定性、概率性和认识论场景下的表现。研究结果显示，GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5在推理时达到了高水平的政策一致性和可靠性，而其他模型的表现则有所不同。

Conclusion: ARB为定量评估人工智能在能源分析中的推理提供了新的方法，且此框架可用于提升分析的可信性和透明度。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Conclusion: 该框架为评估大型语言模型的推理能力提供了更全面的视角，并指出了其最终答案准确性与推理步骤之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available
at: https://github.com/YuanheZ/DAG-MATH-Formatted-CoT.

Conclusion: 尽管现有的检测方法存在局限性，但UVeye解决方案代表了解决这一问题的一次重大进展。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

Motivation: 探索文本隐写的可能性及其引发的信任危机

Method: 使用开源的8亿参数大型语言模型，开发一种简单有效的文本嵌入和解码协议。

Result: 展示了如何通过大型语言模型实现文本隐藏和解码

Conclusion: 该研究强调了文本与作者意图之间的脱节，对AI安全提出了严峻挑战。

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial

Conclusion: 法律实践应重视对真相的忠诚与公民责任，并在使用AI时加强验证措施，以维持法律的诚信和完整性。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

Conclusion: TRUST框架为安全信赖的大型语言模型部署开辟了新路径，展示了去中心化审计的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

Method: 通过实验和理论分析

Result: 实验结果表明，不同规模的模型在行为巩固过程中的表现和影响各异，展现出从小模型性能折衷到大模型的瞬态不稳定性等多样化结果。

Conclusion: 这种身份巩固过程是实现AGI级可靠性的前提，同时也是安全控制的关键点，需谨慎设计以避免不稳定的目标和行为的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

Conclusion: GPT-4o在动作抽象方面效果较好，但在关联流体的抽象上表现逊色。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: STaBERT通过结合地点的兴趣点和时间信息，显著提高了人类移动预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测对于灾害救援、城市规划和公共卫生至关重要，但现有模型无法充分利用兴趣点提供的语义上下文。

Method: 提出STaBERT模型，结合地点的兴趣点（POI）和时间信息，构建统一的移动性表示。

Result: STaBERT模型在单城市和多城市预测上的GEO-BLEU得分显著提高，分别从0.34提高到0.75和从0.34提高到0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过丰富的语义和时间信息建模，增强了人类移动性预测的表现。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

Motivation: 尽管人工智能在医疗保健中具有巨大潜力，但由于数据质量和公平性的问题，实际应用仍然有限。

Method: 通过AI4HealthyAging项目的案例研究，分析临床数据收集中的偏倚问题。

Result: 识别了历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，并指出这些偏见在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济状态等变量中的体现。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了改善临床问题设计和数据收集公平性和鲁棒性的实用建议，并希望为未来在医疗保健领域开发更公平的人工智能系统项目提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

Result: 本文介绍了一种新颖的修订损害评估模型，用于AI系统在军事行动中的目标参与。该模型结合了时间、空间和力量维度，采用统一的知识表示和推理架构，利用设计科学方法论构建其分层结构，从而捕捉与AI系统相关的类别、结构组件，以及相关的参与向量和上下文方面，同时考虑扩散、严重性、可能性和评估指标，以提供增强的透明推理机制的清晰表示。

Conclusion: 该模型为构建负责任和可信的智能系统提供了基础，以评估军事行动中AI系统所产生的影响。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）如何推动知识图谱（KGs）构建的变革，分析其在传统知识表示和推理中的角色。

Method: 系统综述

Result: 通过系统分析传统KG方法与新兴的LLM驱动方法，明确它们在本体工程、知识提取和知识融合中的影响。

Conclusion: 总结领域的关键趋势，并提出未来的研究方向，以促进知识图谱与大型语言模型之间的深度融合，推动更智能的知识系统的发展。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大型语言模型在持续预训练过程中的适应能力不足问题，特别是在无标签测试数据情况下，探讨如何在不依赖原始模型或外部知识库的前提下进行有效的训练和知识获取。

Method: 通过指令-响应对话格式提出自监督目标，利用文本中本身嵌入的领域知识进行训练。

Result: 提出了一种新的框架（IKnow），能通过指令-响应对话格式制定自监督目标，从而有效地实现持续适应。

Conclusion: IKnow方法展示了在没有外部资源的情况下，如何更好地利用文本中的内在知识进行持续学习，从而提升语言模型的表现。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大多数概念学习方法在真实世界知识库中表现不佳，主要是由于描述逻辑推理器对不一致性和错误数据的脆弱性。

Method: 采用嵌入技术来近似符号推理器的结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在性约束的实例。

Result: EBR在面对缺失和错误数据时表现出更强的鲁棒性，与现有推理器相比具有明显优势。

Conclusion: EBR展示了在处理不完整和错误数据方面的优势，能够有效地近似符号推理器的结果。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法主要关注实体级的对齐，但缺乏解释性推理和训练数据，无法全面对齐实体和关系。

Method: FLORA，基于模糊逻辑的无监督知识图谱对齐方法

Result: FLORA实现了对两个知识图谱中的实体和关系的整体对齐，并在主要基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FLORA提供了一种有效且可解释的无监督对齐方法，适用于处理没有对应实体的情况，并在性能上表现优异。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用自然语言处理基准上表现出色，但其在专业领域的能力仍未充分探讨，尤其是电子商务领域的评估工具匮乏。

Method: 采用半自动化的流程收集真实客户查询和交易记录，建立参考答案，同时通过专家评审确保答案质量，定义每个任务的难度级别以实现细致的评估。

Result: 引入了EcomEval，一个综合的多语言和多模态基准，用于评估大型语言模型在电子商务中的表现。

Conclusion: EcomEval为电子商务领域提供了可靠的评估工具，能够处理复杂的真实购物场景，并支持多种语言，特别是低资源语言。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Method: 通过基准评估初始、当前和未来环境状态的偏差，以及上下文切换和持续性来测试模型适应性。

Result: 提供了一种测量模型在变化环境中理解、预测和调整状态变化的能力的方法。

Conclusion: 一个真正的超智能模型应表现出至少二阶适应性，能够通过数字再补充实现自我维持的计算，以达到最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Method: 提出了一个基于拓扑数据分析的评估框架，旨在自动化推理质量的评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在推理质量评估中的预测能力显著高于传统图度量，表明高质量推理可以通过更高维的几何结构更好地捕捉。

Conclusion: 基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的评估框架能够有效捕捉推理痕迹的几何特征，为推理质量的评估提供了高效且可靠的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured
by higher-dimensional geometric structures rather than purely relational
graphs. We further show that a compact, stable set of topological features
reliably indicates trace quality, offering a practical signal for future
reinforcement learning algorithms.

Result: 用该方法分析GPT-4和GPT-5的表现，发现尽管算术得分高，但实际一般能力仍然较低。

Conclusion: 采用总和均值可以更严格地衡量真正的AGI进展，揭示出当前系统仍然远未达到一般能力。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over

of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
