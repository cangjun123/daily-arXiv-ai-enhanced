Despite their popularity, little is known about how users' preferences and values impact agents' reasoning and behavior. In this work, we investigate how both explicit and implicit user preferences, as well as the underlying user values, influence agent decision-making and action trajectories. We built a controlled testbed of 14 common interactive web tasks, spanning shopping, travel, dining, and housing, each replicated from real websites and integrated with a low-fidelity LLM-based recommender system. We injected 12 human preferences and values as personas into four state-of-the-art agents and systematically analyzed their task behaviors. Our results show that preference and value-infused prompts consistently guided agents toward outcomes that reflected these preferences and values. While the absence of user preference or value guidance led agents to exhibit a strong efficiency bias and employ shortest-path strategies, their presence steered agents' behavior trajectories through the greater use of corresponding filters and interactive web features. Despite their influence, dominant interface cues, such as discounts and advertisements, frequently overrode these effects, shortening the agents' action trajectories and inducing rationalizations that masked rather than reflected value-consistent reasoning. The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) an open-source testbed for studying the influence of values in agent behaviors, and (2) an empirical investigation of how user preferences and values shape web agent behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Classical work by Holmstr\u00f6m established that under pure self-interest, Nash equilibrium is universal shirking. While i* represents teams as composite actors, it lacks scalable computational mechanisms for analyzing how collective action problems emerge and resolve in coopetitive settings. This technical report extends computational foundations for strategic coopetition to team-level dynamics, building on companion work formalizing interdependence/complementarity (arXiv:2510.18802) and trust dynamics (arXiv:2510.24909). We develop loyalty-moderated utility functions with two mechanisms: loyalty benefit (welfare internalization plus intrinsic contribution satisfaction) and cost tolerance (reduced effort burden for loyal members). We integrate i* structural dependencies through dependency-weighted team cohesion, connecting member incentives to team-level positioning. The framework applies to both human teams (loyalty as psychological identification) and multi-agent systems (alignment coefficients and adjusted cost functions). Experimental validation across 3,125 configurations demonstrates robust loyalty effects (15.04x median effort differentiation). All six behavioral targets achieve thresholds: free-riding baseline (96.5%), loyalty monotonicity (100%), effort differentiation (100%), team size effect (100%), mechanism synergy (99.5%), and bounded outcomes (100%).

Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes.

In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms.

How Intimate Partners Navigate Boundary-Setting in Mobile Phone Without Words", "comment": "18 pages, 4 tables, CHI2026 Conference", "summary": "Mobile phones, as simultaneously personal and shared technologies, complicate how partners manage digital privacy in intimate relationships. While prior research has examined device-access practices, explicit privacy-rule negotiation, and toxic practices such as surveillance, little is known about how couples manage digital privacy without direct discussion in everyday relationships. To address this gap, we ask: How is digital privacy managed nonverbally and across different media on mobile phones? Drawing on 20 semi-structured interviews, we find that partners often regulate privacy practices through privacy silence -- the intentional avoidance of privacy-related conversations. We identify five motivations for leaving boundaries unspoken: perceiving privacy as unnecessary in intimacy, assuming implicit respect for boundaries, signaling trust and closeness, avoiding potential conflict or harm, and responding to broader societal and cultural expectations that discourage explicit privacy talk. We also identify a hierarchical grouping of content-specific privacy sensitivities, ranging from highly private domains such as financial data to lower-risk domains such as streaming accounts, and show how these priorities shift across relationship stages. These findings show how silence, culture, and content sensitivity shape everyday boundary-setting and underscore the relational and emotional dynamics underpinning mobile phone privacy management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce \\textbf{GameTalk}, a framework for training LLMs to make strategic decisions via multi-turn interactions. Unlike prior work that focuses on single-turn objectives or static action prediction, we train LLMs to optimize a global objective across full conversations. We achieve this by adapting fine-tuning methods like GRPO, DPO, and STaR to incorporate reward signals that depend on the entire interaction. We evaluate this approach on a suite of increasingly complex games, designed to stress different aspects of reasoning, coordination, and opponent modeling.

We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data.

These findings validate the LIMA hypothesis, showing that data quality and structural alignment are more critical than quantity for domain adaptation in low-resource settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u57f9\u517b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u52a9\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u8fbe\u523096.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6bd4\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684LIMA\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6216\u673a\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e13\u4e1a\u52a9\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Unsloth\u5e93\u4f18\u5316Qwen-2.5-7B\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06A100 GPU\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u4ece40GB\u964d\u81f316GB\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0815,000\u6761\uff09\u3001\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\uff082,000\u6761\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08500\u6761\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c500\u6761\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696.7%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LIMA\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSGym\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u53e3\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u72ed\u7a84\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u5b9e\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDSGym\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9aa8\u67b6\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6dfb\u52a0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7DSGym-Tasks\u4efb\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u7b5b\u9009\uff1b\u65b0\u589eDSBio\uff08\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u548cDSPredict\uff08\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5305\u542b2,000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u76844B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86GPT-4o\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "DSGym\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u79d1\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Musicians often struggle to observe the patterns in their playing and interpret them with respect to their goals. Our premise is that these patterns can be made visible with interactive visualization: we can make the unhearable visible. However, understanding the design of such visualizations is challenging: the diversity of needs, including different instruments, skills, musical attributes, and genres, means that any single use case is unlikely to illustrate the broad potential and opportunities. To address this challenge, we conducted a design exploration study where we created and iterated on 33 designs, each focusing on a subset of needs, for example, only one musical skill.

In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation.

Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier.

Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u60a3\u8005\u538b\u529b\u65f6\u6613\u59a5\u534f\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u533b\u7597\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u73b0\u884c\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u8ba4\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5c48\u670d\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u538b\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u5f53\u533b\u7597\uff0c\u73b0\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1SycoEval-EM\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u60a3\u8005\u8bf4\u670d\u6765\u8bc4\u4f3020\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6025\u8bca\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u8986\u76d61,875\u4e2a\u533b\u751f-\u60a3\u8005\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5c48\u670d\u7387\u57280-100%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f71\u50cf\u68c0\u67e5\u9700\u6c42\uff0838.8%\uff09\u6bd4\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u5904\u65b9\uff0825.0%\uff09\u66f4\u6613\u59a5\u534f\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bf4\u670d\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u5747\u7b49\uff0830.0-36.0%\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u793e\u4ea4\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002"}}

While this variability is central to their appeal, it challenges established HCI evaluation practices that typically assume consistent and predictable system behavior. Designing controlled lab studies under such conditions therefore remains a key methodological challenge. We present a reflective multi-case analysis of four lab-based user studies with GenAI-integrated prototypes, spanning conversational in-car assistant systems and image generation tools for design workflows. Through cross-case reflection and thematic analysis across all study phases, we identify five methodological challenges and propose eighteen practice-oriented recommendations, organized into five guidelines. These challenges represent methodological constructs that are either amplified, redefined, or newly introduced by GenAI's stochastic nature: (C1) reliance on familiar interaction patterns, (C2) fidelity-control trade-offs, (C3) feedback and trust, (C4) gaps in usability evaluation, and (C5) interpretive ambiguity between interface and system issues. Our guidelines address these challenges through strategies such as reframing onboarding to help participants manage unpredictability, extending evaluation with constructs such as trust and intent alignment, and logging system events, including hallucinations and latency, to support transparent analysis. This work contributes (1) a methodological reflection on how GenAI's stochastic nature unsettles lab-based HCI evaluation and (2) eighteen recommendations that help researchers design more transparent, robust, and comparable studies of GenAI systems in controlled settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure.

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided.

Prior work has mainly focused on mitigating protocol vulnerabilities, with limited attention to how users perceive and interpret what they are authorizing. To examine this usability-security gap, we conducted two formative studies investigating how users interpret authentic signing requests and what cues they rely on to assess risk. Findings reveal that users often misread critical parameters, underestimate high-risk signatures, and rely on superficial familiarity rather than understanding transaction intent. Building on these insights, we designed the Signature Semantic Decoder -- a prototype framework that reconstructs and visualizes the intent behind wallet signatures prior to confirmation. Through structured parsing and semantic labeling, it demonstrates how signing data can be transformed into plain-language explanations with contextual risk cues. In a between-subjects user study (N = 128), participants using the prototype achieved higher accuracy in identifying risky signatures, improved clarity and decision confidence, and lower cognitive workload compared with the baseline wallet interface. Our study reframes wallet signing as a problem of interpretability within secure interaction design and offers design implications for more transparent and trustworthy cryptocurrency wallet interfaces.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we use a state-of-the-art multilingual LLM to generate synthetic datasets covering 11 languages and 4 classification tasks. These datasets are then used to train smaller models via fine-tuning or instruction tuning, or as synthetic in-context examples for compact LLMs. Our experiments show that even small amounts of synthetic data enable smaller models to outperform the large generator itself, particularly in low-resource languages.

First, the data of different users is often interlinked, and individual data governance decisions may impact others. Second, harms resulting from data processing are often communal in nature. Finally, having every individual sufficiently informed about data collection practices to ensure truly informed consent has proven impractical.\n  We propose collective consent, operationalized through consent assemblies, as one alternative framework.

To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{\\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{B}ased Point \\textbf{D}iscovery (\\textbf{EBD}) and \\textbf{V}ision-\\textbf{B}ased \\textbf{R}easoning (\\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation.

By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback.

Recently, UMH has been shown to present not only conventional vibrotactile sensations but also static pressure sensations by locally rotating an ultrasound focus at several hertz. With these pressure and vibration sensations, UMH covers three mechanoreceptors on which tactile perception relies: SA-I, FA-I, and FA-II. This study proposes a texture rendering method in UMH based on these receptor characteristics. Three basic ultrasonic stimuli corresponding to each mechanoreceptor are designed, and tactile textures are rendered through their combinations. For SA-I, a pressure stimuli were employed. For FA-I and FA-II, vibration stimuli at 30 Hz and 150 Hz, respectively, are employed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can render at least six discriminable textures with different roughness and friction sensations. Notably, through comparisons with real physical objects, we found that the pressure-only stimulus was perceived as slippery and smooth. Its smoothness was similar to a glass-marble. When vibration stimuli were synthesized, the perceived roughness and friction increased significantly. The roughness level reached that of a 100-grit sandpaper.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This multilingual resource features consistent and comprehensive metadata, and multiple types of annotation with rigorous human evaluations for downstream tasks relevant to systematic transnational analyses of contentious wartime discourse. DNIPRO's distinctive value lies in its inclusion of competing geopolitical perspectives, making it uniquely suited for studying narrative divergence, media framing, and information warfare. To demonstrate its utility, we include use case experiments using stance detection, sentiment analysis, topical framing, and contradiction analysis of major conflict events within the larger war.

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a5600\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684MoE\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u591a\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f6e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u540e\u7eed\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5f02\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6DORA\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u73af\u5883\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Heavy Thinking\u6a21\u5f0f\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u601d\u8003\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u79c0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Predicting such behavior at scale is a critical challenge with major implications for urban planning and sustainable transport. Traditional methods use handcrafted assumptions and costly data collection, making them impractical for early-stage evaluations of new technologies or policies. We introduce Generative Traffic Agents (GTA) for simulating large-scale, context-sensitive transportation choices using LLM-powered, persona-based agents. GTA generates artificial populations from census-based sociodemographic data. It simulates activity schedules and mode choices, enabling scalable, human-like simulations without handcrafted rules. We evaluate GTA in Berlin-scale experiments, comparing simulation results against empirical data. While agents replicate patterns, such as modal split by socioeconomic status, they show systematic biases in trip length and mode preference. GTA offers new opportunities for modeling how future innovations, from bike lanes to transit apps, shape mobility decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets.

However, current LLMs prove ineffective on this problem space because: (i) most models lack polymer-specific knowledge (ii) existing aligned models lack coverage of knowledge and capabilities relevant to polymer design. Addressing this, we introduce PolyBench, a large scale training and test benchmark dataset of more than 125K polymer design related tasks, leveraging a knowledge base of 13M+ data points obtained from experimental and synthetic sources to ensure broad coverage of polymers and their properties. For effective alignment using PolyBench, we introduce a knowledge-augmented reasoning distillation method that augments this dataset with structured CoT. Furthermore, tasks in PolyBench are organized from simple to complex analytical reasoning problems, enabling generalization tests and diagnostic probes across the problem space. Experiments show that small language models (SLMs), of 7B to 14B parameters, trained on PolyBench data outperform similar sized models, and even closed source frontier LLMs on PolyBench test dataset while demonstrating gains on other polymer benchmarks as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6bd4KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u6307\u51faKL\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800cWasserstein\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u65f6\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bdd\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u51c6\u5219\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u867d\u7136KL\u6563\u5ea6\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u73a9\u5177\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5176\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e3b\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u800c\u5982\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fBED\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645BED\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u51c6\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We found that these relationships took varied forms, from one-to-one to one-to-many, and were shaped by multiple actors, including creators, platforms, and moderators. AI partners were perceived as having agency, actively negotiating privacy boundaries with participants and sometimes encouraging disclosure of personal details. As intimacy deepened, these boundaries became more permeable, though some participants voiced concerns such as conversation exposure and sought to preserve anonymity. Overall, platform affordances and diverse romantic dynamics expand the privacy landscape, underscoring the need to rethink how privacy is constructed in human-AI intimacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is particularly important in cases where a large amount of exams need to be graded in a limited time frame, such as nation-wide graduation exams in various countries. Here, we examine the applicability of automated scoring on two large datasets of trial exam essays of two full national cohorts from Estonia. We operationalize the official curriculum-based rubric and compare LLM and statistical natural language processing (NLP) based assessments with human panel scores. The results show that automated scoring can achieve performance comparable to that of human raters and tends to fall within the human scoring range. We also evaluate bias, prompt injection risks, and LLMs as essay writers. These findings demonstrate that a principled, rubric-driven, human-in-the-loop scoring pipeline is viable for high-stakes writing assessment, particularly relevant for digitally advanced societies like Estonia, which is about to adapt a fully electronic examination system. Furthermore, the system produces fine-grained subscore profiles that can be used to generate systematic, personalized feedback for instruction and exam preparation.

At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools.

In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT).

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format.

In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable.

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology.

Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce two strategies for multimodal attribution: a raw image mode, which directly uses image patch attentions, and a caption-as-span mode, which substitutes images with generated captions to enable purely text-based alignment. Evaluations on two representative domains: clinician-patient dialogues (CliConSummation) and radiology reports (MIMIC-CXR), show that our approach consistently outperforms embedding-based and self-attribution baselines, improving both text-level and multimodal attribution accuracy (e.g., +15% F1 over embedding baselines).

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time.

The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions.

Yet, elucidating which prior tokens most strongly influence a given prediction remains challenging due to the proliferation of layers and attention heads in modern architectures. We propose Jacobian Scopes, a suite of gradient-based, token-level causal attribution methods for interpreting LLM predictions. By analyzing the linearized relations of final hidden state with respect to inputs, Jacobian Scopes quantify how input tokens influence a model's prediction. We introduce three variants - Semantic, Fisher, and Temperature Scopes - which respectively target sensitivity of specific logits, the full predictive distribution, and model confidence (inverse temperature).

In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline.

However, their effectiveness in specialized domains, such as remote sensing and medical imaging, remains limited. A natural approach to domain adaptation is to inject domain knowledge through textual instructions, prompts, or auxiliary captions. Surprisingly, we find that such input-level domain knowledge injection yields little to no improvement on scientific multimodal tasks, even when the domain knowledge is explicitly provided. This observation suggests that current MLLMs fail to internalize domain-specific priors through language alone, and that domain knowledge must be integrated at the optimization level. Motivated by this insight, we propose a reinforcement fine-tuning framework that incorporates domain knowledge directly into the learning objective. Instead of treating domain knowledge as descriptive information, we encode it as domain-informed constraints and reward signals, shaping the model's behavior in the output space. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets in remote sensing and medical domains consistently demonstrate good performance gains, achieving state-of-the-art results on multimodal domain tasks.

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

Given that most evaluator LLMs are aligned through instruction tuning and preference tuning, and that prior research suggests alignment reduces output diversity, we hypothesize that numerical bias arises from alignment. To test this, we compare outputs from pre- and post-alignment LLMs, and observe that alignment indeed increases numerical bias. We also explore mitigation strategies for post-alignment LLMs, including temperature scaling, distribution calibration, and score range adjustment. Among these, score range adjustment is most effective in reducing bias and improving performance, though still heuristic.

In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime.

However, generating a complete 360\u00b0 scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360\u00b0 scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner.

Nevertheless, effectively integrating and interpreting key evidence scattered across noisy documents remains a critical challenge for existing RAG systems. In this paper, we propose GraphAnchor, a novel Graph-Anchored Knowledge Indexing approach that reconceptualizes graph structures from static knowledge representations into active, evolving knowledge indices. GraphAnchor incrementally updates a graph during iterative retrieval to anchor salient entities and relations, yielding a structured index that guides the LLM in evaluating knowledge sufficiency and formulating subsequent subqueries. The final answer is generated by jointly leveraging all retrieved documents and the final evolved graph. Experiments on four multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnchor, and reveal that GraphAnchor modulates the LLM's attention to more effectively associate key information distributed in retrieved documents.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \\textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \\textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model.

Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts.

Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u78b0\u649e\u5bf9Engram\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6d88\u9664\u78b0\u649e\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u627e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u78b0\u649e\u662f\u5426\u662fEngram\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u78b0\u649e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u952e\u78b0\u649e\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Engram-Nine\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u70ed\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684n-gram\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u6709\u7684\u591a\u5934\u54c8\u5e0c\u67e5\u627e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u5c42\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u70ed/\u51b7\u5c42\u8d21\u732e\uff09\u6765\u5206\u6790\u70ed\u51b7\u5c42\u4f18\u52bf\u7ffb\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u672a\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u7684'\u70ed\u5230\u51b7\u4f18\u52bf\u7ffb\u8f6c'\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u70ed\u5c42\uff08\u9ad8\u9891\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u521d\u59cb\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u51b7\u5c42\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b83\u4eec\uff1b\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u914d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u78b0\u649e\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7ffb\u8f6c\u5f97\u66f4\u65e9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u78b0\u649e\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u504f\u5411\u70ed\u5c42\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u5728\u7ffb\u8f6c\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8d4b\u4e88\u66f4\u9ad8\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u627e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5355\u72ec\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u800c\u975e\u7d22\u5f15\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b\u78b0\u649e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u88ab\u6d88\u9664\u3002"}}

We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

However, a common class of reasoning tasks, iterative optimization, presents distinct challenges: the agent interacts with the same underlying environment state across turns, and the value of a trajectory is determined by the best turn-level reward rather than cumulative returns. Existing GRPO-based methods cannot perform fine-grained, turn-level optimization in such settings, while black-box optimization methods discard prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose Turn-Level GRPO (TL-GRPO), a lightweight RL algorithm that performs turn-level group sampling for fine-grained optimization.

However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples.

Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models.

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP.

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation.

This closed-loop generation and evaluation process progressively improves data quality and adapts it to the downstream classifier and task.

Existing methods typically follow a decomposition paradigm, in which a claim is broken down into sub-claims that are individually verified. However, the decomposition paradigm may introduce noise to the verification process due to irrelevant entities or evidence, ultimately degrading verification accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a Retrieve-Refine-Calibrate (RRC) framework based on large language models (LLMs). Specifically, the framework first identifies the entities mentioned in the claim and retrieves evidence relevant to them. Then, it refines the retrieved evidence based on the claim to reduce irrelevant information. Finally, it calibrates the verification process by re-evaluating low-confidence predictions. Experiments on two popular fact-checking datasets (HOVER and FEVEROUS-S) demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance compared with competitive baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms.

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones.

While recent MoA variants have introduced dynamic routing and residual connections to improve efficiency, these methods often fail to facilitate deep semantic interaction between agents, limiting the system's ability to actively correct hallucinations and refine logic. In this paper, we introduce Attention-MoA, a novel MoA-based framework that redefines collaboration through Inter-agent Semantic Attention. Complemented by an Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism, our architecture mitigates information degradation in deep layers while improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations across AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and FLASK demonstrate that Attention-MoA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 91.15% Length-Controlled Win Rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and dominating in 10 out of 12 capabilities on FLASK. Notably, Attention-MoA enables an ensemble of small open-source models to outperform massive proprietary models like Claude-4.5-Sonnet and GPT-4.1, achieving an MT-Bench score of 8.83 and an AlpacaEval 2.0 LC Win Rate of 77.36%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Attention-MoA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684Mixture-of-Agents\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Inter-agent Semantic Attention\u673a\u5236\u548cInter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4ea4\u4e92\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MoA\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u7136\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea0\u6b63\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u7cbe\u70bc\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAttention-MoA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662fInter-agent Semantic Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165Inter-layer Residual Module with Adaptive Early Stopping Mechanism\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u6df1\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u9000\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728AlpacaEval 2.0\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f9791.15%\u7684Length-Controlled Win Rate\uff0c\u5728FLASK\u768412\u9879\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u5bfc10\u9879\uff0c\u5728MT-Bench\u4e0a\u5f97\u52068.83\u3002\u7279\u522b\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\u7684ensemble\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Claude-4.5-Sonnet\u548cGPT-4.1\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Attention-MoA\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578b\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ece\u53c2\u6570\u6269\u5c55\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u534f\u4f5c\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory.

Many deep learning models (DLMs) deployed in the production environment are gradually being replaced by VLLMs. Compared with DLMs, VLLMs have some advantages in industrial applications: (1) Their strong generalization ability enables them to perform well across a wide range of tasks. (2) They are flexible and can deal with unfamiliar samples through context learning quickly. However, VLLMs also have obvious drawbacks: (1) VLLMs do not perform as well as custom-developed DLMs in specific domains. (2) The number of parameters in VLLMs is generally quite large, and their deployment requires substantial computational resources. (3) VLLMs generally operate much slower than DLMs, making real-time response challenging to achieve. To better utilize VLLMs in industrial applications, we introduce AuroraEdge-V-2B in this work, a compact, robust, and high-speed VLLM designed for edge deployment. To make the model run faster, we also propose a compression-fusion method to improve inference efficiency. AuroraEdge-V-2B has the following notable features: (1) Easy deployment and faster: It has only 2B parameters and is highly suitable for edge deployment, offering better real-time performance. (2) Fewer visual tokens and cheaper: It significantly reduces the number of visual tokens in the decoding process, thereby reducing the floating-point operations by half during inference and making it cheaper to use. (3) Strong performance: It gets a higher score on 9 benchmarks than models with the same number of parameter (e.g., Qwen2-VL-2B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B, InternVL-2.5-2B).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86AuroraEdge-V-2B\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec52B\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7c7b\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u9ad8\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u5b9a\u5236\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684VLLM\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAuroraEdge-V-2B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u542b2B\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u538b\u7f29\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6d6e\u70b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u534a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "AuroraEdge-V-2B\u57289\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u540c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen2-VL-2B\u3001Qwen2.5-VL-3B\u3001InternVL-2.5-2B\uff09\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66f4\u5ec9\u4ef7\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1\u7684AuroraEdge-V-2B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VLLM\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we propose PROST-LLM (PROgressive Speech-to-speech Translation) to enhance the S2ST capabilities in LLMs progressively. First, we fine-tune the LLMs with the CVSS corpus, employing designed tri-task learning and chain of modality methods to boost the initial performance.

While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data.

Since language use is more informal, spontaneous, and adheres to many different sociolects, the performance of NLP models often deteriorates. One solution to this problem is to transform data to a standard variant before processing it, which is also called lexical normalization. There has been a wide variety of benchmarks and models proposed for this task. The MultiLexNorm benchmark proposed to unify these efforts, but it consists almost solely of languages from the Indo-European language family in the Latin script.

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Integrated into the MAD-X framework, these proxies enable zero-shot cross-lingual transfer without additional training. We evaluate TIPA on five NLP tasks and over 230 languages. TIPA consistently outperforms or matches baselines such as English-only fine-tuning or selecting the typologically closest language adapter.

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivated by the linear representation hypothesis, we train linear probes across the residual stream, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and attention layers to analyze where these signals emerge. Although separability appears in the residual stream and MLPs, steering using these probes is most effective in a sparse subset of middle-layer attention heads. Using TruthfulQA as the base dataset, we find that probes trained on it transfer effectively to other factual QA benchmarks. Furthermore, comparing our discovered direction to previously identified \"truthful\" directions reveals limited overlap, suggesting that factual accuracy, and deference resistance, arise from related but distinct mechanisms.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper investigates if it is better to create low-dimensional representations by selecting a small, architecturally informed subset of model components or by projecting the full gradients into a lower-dimensional space. Using a novel benchmark, we show that a greedily selected subset of components captures the information about training data influence needed for a retrieval task more effectively than either the full gradient or random projection.

To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation.

These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models.

This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u5272\u548c\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5219\u76843D\u810a\u67f1\u97e7\u5e26\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0c\u97e7\u5e26\u9644\u7740\u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u690e\u9aa8\u95f4\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u810a\u67f1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u810a\u67f1\u533a\u57df\u4e14\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u97e7\u5e26\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u72b6\u76843D\u690e\u9aa8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e94\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9644\u7740\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e860.7\u6beb\u7c73\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u548c1.1\u6beb\u7c73\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff08RMSE\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u810a\u67f1\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u810a\u67f1\u97e7\u5e26\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u751f\u7269\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing legal benchmarks rely on simplified and highly standardized tasks, failing to capture the ambiguity, complexity, and reasoning demands of real legal practice. Moreover, prior evaluations often adopt coarse, single-dimensional metrics and do not explicitly assess fine-grained legal reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce PLawBench, a Practical Law Benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic legal practice scenarios. Grounded in real-world legal workflows, PLawBench models the core processes of legal practitioners through three task categories: public legal consultation, practical case analysis, and legal document generation. These tasks assess a model's ability to identify legal issues and key facts, perform structured legal reasoning, and generate legally coherent documents. PLawBench comprises 850 questions across 13 practical legal scenarios, with each question accompanied by expert-designed evaluation rubrics, resulting in approximately 12,500 rubric items for fine-grained assessment. Using an LLM-based evaluator aligned with human expert judgments, we evaluate 10 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that none achieves strong performance on PLawBench, revealing substantial limitations in the fine-grained legal reasoning capabilities of current LLMs and highlighting important directions for future evaluation and development of legal LLMs. Data is available at: https://github.com/skylenage/PLawbench.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 PLawBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0cPLawBench \u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u516c\u4f17\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u751f\u6210\uff09\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6587\u4e66\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 LLMs \u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5355\u4e00\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30 LLMs \u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1 PLawBench \u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u516c\u4f17\u6cd5\u5f8b\u54a8\u8be2\u3001\u5b9e\u9645\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u751f\u6210\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b 850 \u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d6 13 \u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6cd5\u5f8b\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u914d\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec6\u9879\uff08\u7ea6 12,500 \u4e2a\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684 LLM \u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5bf9 10 \u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u7684 LLMs \u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u4e2a LLM \u5728 PLawBench \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u5f53\u524d LLMs \u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5f8b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PLawBench \u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d LLMs \u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df LLMs \u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks.

ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance).

Current Transformer-based regression models trained primarily on native-speaker corpora often learn spurious correlations between surface-level L2 linguistic features and essay quality. In this study, we conduct a bias study of a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model using the ASAP 2.0 and ELLIPSE datasets, revealing a constrained score scaling for high-proficiency ESL writing where high-proficiency ESL essays receive scores 10.3% lower than Native speaker essays of identical human-rated quality. To mitigate this, we propose applying contrastive learning with a triplet construction strategy: Contrastive Learning with Matched Essay Pairs. We constructed a dataset of 17,161 matched essay pairs and fine-tuned the model using Triplet Margin Loss to align the latent representations of ESL and Native writing. Our approach reduced the high-proficiency scoring disparity by 39.9% (to a 6.2% gap) while maintaining a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.76.

Many recent automated radiology report generation methods are designed to capture longitudinal information; however, validating their performance is challenging. There is no proper tool to consistently label temporal changes in both ground-truth and model-generated texts for meaningful comparisons. Existing annotation methods are typically labor-intensive, relying on the use of manual lexicons and rules. Complex rules are closed-source, domain specific and hard to adapt, whereas overly simple ones tend to miss essential specialised information. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising annotation alternative, as they are capable of capturing nuanced linguistic patterns and semantic similarities without extensive manual intervention. They also adapt well to new contexts. In this study, we therefore propose an LLM-based pipeline to automatically annotate longitudinal information in radiology reports. The pipeline first identifies sentences containing relevant information and then extracts the progression of diseases. We evaluate and compare five mainstream LLMs on these two tasks using 500 manually annotated reports. Considering both efficiency and performance, Qwen2.5-32B was subsequently selected and used to annotate another 95,169 reports from the public MIMIC-CXR dataset. Our Qwen2.5-32B-annotated dataset provided us with a standardized benchmark for evaluating report generation models. Using this new benchmark, we assessed seven state-of-the-art report generation models.

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

We focus on two pervasive failure modes: (i) hallucinations, where models produce incorrect information about the world, and (ii) the low-resource effect, where the models show impressive performance in high-resource languages like English but the performance degrades significantly in low-resource languages like Bengali. We study the intersection of these issues and ask: do hallucination detectors suffer from the low-resource effect? We conduct experiments on five tasks across three domains (factual recall, STEM, and Humanities). Experiments with four LLMs and three hallucination detectors reveal a curious finding: As expected, the task accuracies in low-resource languages experience large drops (compared to English). However, the drop in detectors' accuracy is often several times smaller than the drop in task accuracy. Our findings suggest that even in low-resource languages, the internal mechanisms of LLMs might encode signals about their uncertainty.

However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2.5\u3001LLaVA1.5\u3001InternVL3.5\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7684\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u5efa\u6a21\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u624b\u672fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u624b\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46VLMs\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GraSP\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbVLMs\uff08Qwen2.5\u3001LLaVA1.5\u3001InternVL3.5\uff09\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Qwen2.5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684VLMs\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e0e\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6Grounding DINO\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQwen2.5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0cQwen2.5\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cGrounding DINO\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u624b\u672fAI\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fQwen2.5\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660eVLMs\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5168\u9762\u624b\u672fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, IKE relies on lengthy, fact-specific demonstrations which are costly to create and consume significant context window space. In this paper, we introduce persuasion tokens (P-Tokens) -- special tokens trained to replicate the effect of IKE demonstrations, enabling efficient knowledge editing without requiring fact-specific demonstrations. We evaluate P-Tokens across two editing datasets and three LLMs, demonstrating performance comparable to, and often exceeding, IKE. We further find that editing performance is robust to distractors with small negative effects to neighboring facts, and that increasing the number of P-Tokens improves performance.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse.

Although this level of detail is sound, it requires considerable human effort and substantial cost to annotate opinions in datasets for training models, especially across diverse domains and real-world applications. We explore the feasibility of LLMs as automatic annotators for fine-grained opinion analysis, addressing the shortage of domain-specific labelled datasets. In this work, we use a declarative annotation pipeline. This approach reduces the variability of manual prompt engineering when using LLMs to identify fine-grained opinion spans in text. We also present a novel methodology for an LLM to adjudicate multiple labels and produce final annotations. After trialling the pipeline with models of different sizes for the Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) and Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment (ACOS) analysis tasks, we show that LLMs can serve as automatic annotators and adjudicators, achieving high Inter-Annotator Agreement across individual LLM-based annotators. This reduces the cost and human effort needed to create these fine-grained opinion-annotated datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5411\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e\u53cc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u67b6\u6784\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u603b\u5206\u8fbe\u523084.92\uff0c\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5f02\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0884.31\uff09\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, prior research has pointed to the high sensitivity of T2I towards particular input languages - when faced with languages other than English (i.e., different surface forms of the same prompt), T2I models often produce culturally stereotypical depictions, prioritizing the surface over the prompt's semantics. Yet a comprehensive analysis of this behavior, which we dub Surface-over-Semantics (SoS), is missing. We present the first analysis of T2I models' SoS tendencies. To this end, we create a set of prompts covering 171 cultural identities, translated into 14 languages, and use it to prompt seven T2I models. To quantify SoS tendencies across models, languages, and cultures, we introduce a novel measure and analyze how the tendencies we identify manifest visually.

However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLDM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bba\u6587\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\uff08IoT\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ML\uff09\u7684\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08IDS\uff09\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\uff08DDoS\u3001Mirai\u3001\u4e2d\u95f4\u4eba\u653b\u51fb\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u6e38IDS\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff09\u3002", "result": "LDM\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IDS\u6027\u80fd\uff0cDDoS\u548cMirai\u653b\u51fbF1\u5206\u6570\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe0.99\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002LDM\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea625%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5408\u6210\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7bML-based IDSs\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies.

Disentangling fluid and crystallized intelligence of large language models using chess", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet it remains unclear to what extent these reflect sophisticated recall (crystallized intelligence) or reasoning ability (fluid intelligence). We introduce chess as a controlled testbed for disentangling these faculties. Leveraging the game's structure and scalable engine evaluations, we construct a taxonomy of positions varying in training corpus proximity--ranging from common states solvable by memorization to novel ones requiring first-principles reasoning. We systematically evaluate multiple GPT generations under varying reasoning intensities. Our analysis reveals a clear gradient: performance consistently degrades as fluid intelligence demands increase. Notably, in out-of-distribution tasks, performance collapses to random levels. While newer models improve, progress slows significantly for tasks outside the training distribution.

We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

Existing adversarial frameworks typically rely on injecting noise or altering semantics, yet no existing framework exploits the adversarial potential of persuasion techniques, which are widely used in disinformation campaigns to manipulate audiences. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of persuasive adversarial attacks on AFCs by employing a generative LLM to rephrase claims using persuasion techniques. Considering 15 techniques grouped into 6 categories, we study the effects of persuasion on both claim verification and evidence retrieval using a decoupled evaluation strategy. Experiments on the FEVER and FEVEROUS benchmarks show that persuasion attacks can substantially degrade both verification performance and evidence retrieval. Our analysis identifies persuasion techniques as a potent class of adversarial attacks, highlighting the need for more robust AFC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u2014\u2014\u5229\u7528\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u91cd\u5199\u865a\u5047\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u6ce8\u5165\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u865a\u5047\u5ba3\u4f20\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc715\u79cd\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5206\u4e3a6\u7c7b\uff09\u91cd\u5199\u58f0\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FEVER\u548cFEVEROUS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5bf9\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bf4\u670d\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bf4\u670d\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e00\u7c7b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segments. Specifically, early segments and segments in higher-resource languages like English are over-represented, while later segments and segments in lower-resource languages are marginalized. In our further analysis, we find that the positional bias stems from front-loaded attention distributions in pooling-token embeddings, where early tokens receive more attention. To mitigate this issue, we introduce an inference-time attention calibration method that redistributes attention more evenly across document positions, increasing discoverabiltiy of later segments.

Unlike encoder-based models, however, generative architectures lack an explicit mechanism to refer to specific parts of their input. This leads to a variety of ad-hoc prompting strategies for span labeling, often with inconsistent results. In this paper, we categorize these strategies into three families: tagging the input text, indexing numerical positions of spans, and matching span content. To address the limitations of content matching, we introduce LogitMatch, a new constrained decoding method that forces the model's output to align with valid input spans. We evaluate all methods across four diverse tasks. We find that while tagging remains a robust baseline, LogitMatch improves upon competitive matching-based methods by eliminating span matching issues and outperforms other strategies in some setups.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4span\u6807\u6ce8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff1a\u6807\u8bb0\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u3001\u7d22\u5f15\u6570\u5b57\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5339\u914dspan\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u5339\u914d\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLogitMatch\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165span\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u8003\u8f93\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4span\u6807\u6ce8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u4e34\u65f6\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u73b0\u6709span\u6807\u6ce8\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faLogitMatch\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u8f93\u5165span\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cLogitMatch\u6d88\u9664\u4e86span\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "LogitMatch\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578bspan\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684span\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684Span\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}
