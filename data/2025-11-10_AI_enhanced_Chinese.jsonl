Traditionally, these\nreports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses,\nmagnifying glasses, and notebooks.

To overcome these limitations, the use of\nartificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of\nreports through the processing of images and field data.

We then aligned an LLM-based ideation\nsystem to first-wave human ratings and used it to select new ideas.

Our approach combines speech analysis, computer\nvision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides\nassessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch,\nloudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial\nexpressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel\nintegration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike\nprevious systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple\nmodalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing\ndemonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert\nevaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro\nemerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human\nannotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public\nspeaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align\ntheir speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and\nprofessional communication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u6f14\u8bb2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\u6539\u5584\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6c9f\u901a\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7AI\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6301\u7eed\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u6559\u80b2\u4f53\u7cfb\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6c9f\u901a\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dGemini Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u7684AI\u9a71\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6f14\u8bb2\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u5347\u6c9f\u901a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6f14\u8bb2\u4e0e\u80a2\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

Recent studies suggest that incorporating sentiment information from\nboth news content and user comments can enhance detection performance. However,\nexisting approaches typically treat sentiment features as auxiliary signals,\noverlooking role differentiation, that is, the same sentiment polarity may\noriginate from users with distinct roles, thereby limiting their ability to\ncapture nuanced patterns for effective detection. To address this issue, we\npropose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes\nsentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake\nnews detection. The framework first generates user features through joint\ncomment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment\nencoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to\nautomatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which\ntake fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint\noptimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to\nfurther improve the model performance.

To avoid the\nprohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++\noptimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step\napproximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps\nbut also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward\nalternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model\npreference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones\n($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to\nensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping\nother factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose\nperforming preference learning over control conditions rather than generated\nimages. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,\n$\\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer\n$\\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \\textit{Condition Preference\nOptimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance\ntraining objective.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where\nhigher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the\nreliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction\nhierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first\n\"think\" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority\n(system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability\nvia training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of\nconstraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both\naligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight\nreinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning\ncapabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models\nachieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction\nhierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to\nsafety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety\nissues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined\nhigher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against\njailbreak and prompt injection attacks.

We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian\nSplatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable\naccuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component\nin Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and\nFLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight\nenough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u57283D\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b33D\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u548cPointNets\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa3D\u9ad8\u65af\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfPointNet\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb2.7\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1146%\uff0cFLOPs\u51cf\u5c1188%\u3002\u5728Mamba3D\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "3D Gaussian Point Encoders\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684PointNet\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728CPU\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u3002"}}

In\nthis study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges\nusing Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a\nsimple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse\ntraining subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation\nperformance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial\nredundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space\nanalysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches\ncapture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine\ncatastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and\nobserve significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when\nadapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective\nDQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively\nrestores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.\nAdditionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization\nand reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest\nthat efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention\naware learning strategies and informed domain ordering.

Designed as a model-agnostic reasoning module, RADAR can\nbe seamlessly integrated with diverse large language models, consistently\nimproving their rare pathology recognition and interpretability. On the NOVA\ndataset comprising 280 distinct rare diseases, RADAR achieves up to a 10.2%\nperformance gain, with the strongest improvements observed for open source\nmodels such as DeepSeek.

In this paper, we introduce\nPuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high\naccuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE\nperforms sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy\nand specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and\nexpert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary\nmasks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses\nunderutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up\nto 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks.

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it\nremains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of\ntheir responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain\nsampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably\nwell-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain\nquestion-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our\nmain theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic\ncalibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a\nrecent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory\nrelies on a general definition of \"B-calibration,\" which is a notion of\ncalibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or\notherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base\nLLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own\ndistribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We\nstate three implications of this prediction, which we validate through\nexperiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across\nquestion-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this\ncalibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration.

This paper\nintroduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional\nlatent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement\nLearning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking\napproach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates\nin the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering\nprecise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm\nempowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between\nrobustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and\nmalicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.\nComprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that\nour method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving\nimprovements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under\nchallenging manipulation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528MAARL\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u65b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u6297\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MAARL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6c34\u5370\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728CelebA\u548cCelebA-HQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e864.5%\u548c5.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

While recent advances have extended context\nwindows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource\nconstrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented\narchitecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything.\nOur system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience\nscoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide\nwhich information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike\nexisting retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks,\nBudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval\nfor efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700\nquestion answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens)\ndocuments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves\nremarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while\nsaving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through\nbudget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline\ncomparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits\nincrease with document length.

Generative approaches promise\nfaster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,\nbut are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor\ngeneralisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from\nstructural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments.

Our approach begins by collecting a comprehensive list of\nChinese emotional event indicators.

To\nensure the quality of these emotional events, we train a filter to discard\ninvalid generated results. We also classify these emotional events as being\npositive events and negative events using different techniques. Finally, we\nharvest a total of 102,218 high-quality common emotional events with sentiment\npolarity labels, which is the only large-scale commonsense knowledge base of\nemotional events in Chinese language.

This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark\nestablished for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and\ncompetitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark\ncomprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five\ncomplexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading\nproprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a\none-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against\nhidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even\ntop-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the\nproblems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural\nlanguage. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of\nperformance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of\nsolution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time\nand memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work\ndemonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating\nlarge language models, especially in underrepresented languages.

However, the generalizability of\nthese label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning\ncapabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate\nthe performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and\nreasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals\ncritical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's\npre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below\nbaseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate\nsufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective\nself-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in\ndetermining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet\neffective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to\nprogressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority\nrollouts during training.

In\nthe real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments\nwith different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)\nadaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address\nthe issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,\nparticularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still\nineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.\nTo break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA\nframework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative\nstrategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware\nimage masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained\nMDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose\ninformation. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts\ninstance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)\nfrom a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation\nnetwork, by removing static objects including background components. To further\nboost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction\nmethodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.\nExtensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with\nvarying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,\nPITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable\nperformance improvements in MDE during TTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6PITTA\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709MDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684TTA\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u6846\u67b6PITTA\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u65e0\u89c6\u89d2TTA\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u906e\u7f69\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "PITTA\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u906e\u7f69\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u7acb\u4f53\u548cWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684MDE\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u80cc\u666f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "PITTA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MDE\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

This report empirically assesses the\nperformance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their\nlinguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a\nhuman benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral\n24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential\narchitectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM.

Recent studies have established global\nconvergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence\nin noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

We derive\nexplicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and\nregression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural\nproperties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the\ntrajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by\nestablishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high\nSNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The\ntrajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM\nestimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle\nbetween the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our\nanalysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on\nstatistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating\nEM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence\nwith arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level.

In\nthis paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that\nbypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside\nfeatures,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect\nlane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth\nlane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial\nconsistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these\nchallenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset\ncontaining 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with\nvarying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art\nlane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved\nrobustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.\nThis work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter\nscenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in\nall-weather autonomous driving.

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context\ninjection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the\ngeneration process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on\nthe model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with\nuser-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output\nquality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we\npropose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that\nredefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from\nalignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a\nhigh-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly\nrewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection\nmodule is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning\nis employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core\npersonalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to\nuser-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to\nfurther refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs.\nComprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by\ndecoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of\nexplicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO\nintroduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be\nseamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new\nand effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "RPO\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u5199\u8be5\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002\u53cd\u601d\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u662f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728LaMP\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\u5851\u9020\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u53ef\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "RPO\uff08\u53cd\u601d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u54cd\u5e94\u5851\u9020\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5c42\u3002"}}

To\nbetter leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a\nsimple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight\narithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the\nweight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired\nbehavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this\ndirection to modify the model's weights. We apply this technique to mitigate\nsycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often\ngeneralizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger\nout-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities.\nWe also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering\ncan partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and\nunder-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance\ngains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can\nbe detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an\n\"evil\" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the\nevolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that\nnever manifest during training or evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8c03\u6574\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5931\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba1\u89c6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u51cf\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u963f\u8c00\u5949\u627f\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u9519\u8bef\u62d2\u7edd\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51cf\u8f7b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6743\u91cd\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u76d1\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5931\u8c03\u3002"}}

Automated segmentation could enhance precision\nand efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.\n  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used\nto train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two\nvariants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped\nregions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference\n(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated\ninto 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.\n  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume\nmodel across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =\n0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic\nsegmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min).

In\nthis study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach\nleveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically\nreduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP\npruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign\nhigher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher\nperforming sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques.

Comprehensive experiments\non Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the\nart approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.\nThese findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical\nalignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances\nin 4D articulated object perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Artic4D \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c CanonSeg4D \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684 4D \u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6 CanonSeg4D\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u6bcf\u5e27\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5c06\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86 Artic4D \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7 CanonSeg4D \u6846\u67b6\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7 CanonSeg4D \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show\npromise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly\nrely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow\nreasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We\npropose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning\nframework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking\nconsistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior\nQA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that\nseparately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference\nalignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design\nencourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning\nabout perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a\nglobal-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality\nAssessment.

Although these approaches result in impressive reductions\nin compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically\nin-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute\ntradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications\nrequire more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency\nand memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that\nartificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent\nstate update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at\nspecific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design\nprocess, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &\nAttend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two\nsimple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of\ntokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression\nresults in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and\nmemory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for\nefficiency.

Official code:\n  https://github.com/Time-Search/TimeSearch-R", "summary": "Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens\nof thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate\nlong-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow\nthe search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted\nsearch process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal\nsearch as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching\nvideo clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).\nHowever, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate\nsearch decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content\nand inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO\nwith Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video\nframes from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy\nmodel to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the\ncompleteness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets\nspecifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,\nfiltering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task\ndifficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal\nsearch benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as\nlong-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU.

Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration\nframework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of\nTSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,\ncontext-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by\nadaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other\npopular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating\nSynapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Synapse\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540cTSFM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u5b58\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ef2\u88c1\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Synapse\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSynapse\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5355\u72ecTSFMs\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Synapse\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540cTSFM\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce\nSoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key\ncomponents: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX\neliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates\nContrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the\nOrthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle\ncross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral\nantenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure\nsoil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement.
