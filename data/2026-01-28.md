Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态NeRF在生成说话人像方面取得进展，但在准确高效捕捉嘴部运动方面仍存挑战，需要提升生成质量和保真度。

Method: 使用眨眼嵌入和哈希网格标记点编码作为条件特征，通过动态标记点变换器集成音频特征作为残差项，采用神经辐射场建模整个脸部。

Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种使用自拍视频实现详细头部虚拟人重演的方法，结合3D变形模型与StyleGAN生成器，通过混合损失函数在对抗训练中恢复高频细节，相比现有方法能在更少数据下实现更高质量的头部重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3DMM方法难以实时捕捉完整头部（包括非面部区域和背景细节），而基于GAN的方法在再现皱纹、发丝等细粒度细节方面存在局限，且大多依赖大量训练数据。本研究旨在解决这些挑战，实现仅用自拍视频就能生成高质量头部虚拟人。

Method: 结合3D变形模型和基于StyleGAN的生成器，提出详细重建模型，在对抗训练中使用混合损失函数进行前景重建和虚拟人生成，以恢复高频细节。

Result: 在自重演和交叉重演任务中的定性和定量评估显示，该方法相比现有方法能实现纹理更丰富、细节更精细的头部虚拟人重建。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效使用单段自拍视频生成高质量的详细头部虚拟人，在纹理细节和重建质量上优于现有方法，为虚拟人应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.

*Haim Zisman,Uri Shaham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于统计理论的AI生成图像检测框架，通过计算多个检测指标的p值并进行统计集成，生成可解释的概率分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的AI生成图像检测方法缺乏正式的统计可解释性，并且依赖对伪造内容的隐式假设，限制了在分布变化场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 利用多个现有检测器的无训练统计量，计算一系列测试统计量的p值，然后使用经典的统计集成方法（如Fisher方法）来评估与真实图像分布的符合程度。

Result: 该方法提供了一个通用、灵活且无需训练的框架，能够生成具有统计可解释性的伪造图像概率评分。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI生成图像检测提供了统计上严格的框架，提高了检测结果的可解释性和对分布变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.

### [5] [On the Role of Depth in Surgical Vision Foundation Models: An Empirical Study of RGB-D Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18929)
*John J. Han,Adam Schmidt,Muhammad Abdullah Jamal,Chinedu Nwoye,Anita Rau,Jie Ying Wu,Omid Mohareri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在八种手术数据集上对比八种ViT基础视觉基础模型，发现使用深度信息预训练的模型（特别是几何感知模型）在多个任务上显著优于仅使用RGB的模型，且具有出色的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术视觉基础模型主要依赖单模态RGB预训练，忽略了手术环境的复杂3D几何结构。尽管已有支持多模态或几何感知输入的架构，但在手术场景中整合深度信息的好处尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用140万张机器人手术图像与深度图组成的策划数据集对八种基于ViT的视觉基础模型进行预训练，模型在预训练领域、学习目标和输入模态（RGB vs. RGB-D）上有所不同。在八种手术数据集上通过冻结主干和端到端微调两种协议评估模型，涵盖目标检测、分割、深度估计和姿态估计任务。

Result: 采用显式几何标记化的模型（如MultiMAE）在所有任务上都显著优于单模态基线。几何感知预训练展现出卓越的数据效率：仅用25%标记数据微调的模型就能够持续超越使用全部数据训练的RGB模型。这些优势在推理时无需架构或运行时更改，深度信息仅在预训练阶段使用。

Conclusion: 多模态预训练为构建更强大的手术视觉系统提供了可行路径，几何感知预训练能大幅提升模型性能和数据效率，且易于在实际应用中部署。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for surgical scene understanding. However, current approaches predominantly rely on unimodal RGB pre-training, overlooking the complex 3D geometry inherent to surgical environments. Although several architectures support multimodal or geometry-aware inputs in general computer vision, the benefits of incorporating depth information in surgical settings remain underexplored. We conduct a large-scale empirical study comparing eight ViT-based VFMs that differ in pre-training domain, learning objective, and input modality (RGB vs. RGB-D). For pre-training, we use a curated dataset of 1.4 million robotic surgical images paired with depth maps generated from an off-the-shelf network. We evaluate these models under both frozen-backbone and end-to-end fine-tuning protocols across eight surgical datasets spanning object detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and pose estimation. Our experiments yield several consistent findings. Models incorporating explicit geometric tokenization, such as MultiMAE, substantially outperform unimodal baselines across all tasks. Notably, geometric-aware pre-training enables remarkable data efficiency: models fine-tuned on just 25% of labeled data consistently surpass RGB-only models trained on the full dataset. Importantly, these gains require no architectural or runtime changes at inference; depth is used only during pre-training, making adoption straightforward. These findings suggest that multimodal pre-training offers a viable path towards building more capable surgical vision systems.

*Zahra Hafezi Kafshgari,Ivan V. Bajic,Parvaneh Saeedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究Split-Federated学习中通信信道噪声对学习过程和最终模型质量的影响，提出一种智能平均策略以提高抗噪声能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SplitFed学习中，特征值、梯度更新和模型更新通过通信信道传输时，会受到信道噪声的影响，降低学习效率和最终模型质量。

Method: 提出一种智能平均策略(Smart Averaging Strategy)用于Split-Federated学习，通过优化的平均值计算方法来提高对信道噪声的鲁棒性。

Result: 在胚胎图像分割模型上的实验表明，提出的智能平均策略相比传统平均方法，能够容忍两个数量级更强的通信信道噪声，同时保持最终模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 智能平均策略显著提高了SplitFed学习对通信信道噪声的鲁棒性，在保持模型精度的前提下增强了系统对噪声的容忍能力。

Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了视频连接新任务及其专用基准VC-Bench，包含1,579个高质量视频和三项核心评估指标，发现了现有视频生成模型在保持首尾一致性和过渡平滑性方面的显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成主要关注文本或图像条件，但实际应用如视频编辑和vlog制作需要将独立片段无缝连接。视频连接任务缺乏标准化评估基准，阻碍了该领域发展，因此需建立专门基准。

Method: 提出VC-Bench基准：1）收集1,579个高质量公开视频，覆盖15个主类和72个子类确保多样性；2）建立三方面评估框架：视频质量得分(VQS)、首尾一致性得分(SECS)、过渡平滑性得分(TSS)。

Result: 在VC-Bench上评估多个最先进视频生成模型，实验结果显示现有模型在保持首尾一致性和过渡平滑性方面存在显著局限，导致整体连贯性和流畅性较低。

Conclusion: VC-Bench可作为开创性基准激发和引导未来视频连接研究，评估指标和数据集已公开，有助于推动该任务的发展和标准化评估。

Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting. The evaluation metrics and dataset are publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VC-Bench-1B67/.

Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging requires uncertainty quantification that provides rigorous error guarantees while remaining anatomically meaningful. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful distribution-free framework for constructing statistically valid prediction intervals. However, standard applications in segmentation often ignore anatomical context, resulting in fragmented, spatially incoherent, and over-segmented prediction sets that limit clinical utility. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Random-Walk Conformal Prediction (RW-CP), a model-agnostic framework which can be added on top of any segmentation method. RW-CP enforces spatial coherence to generate anatomically valid sets. Our method constructs a k-nearest neighbour graph from pre-trained vision foundation model features and applies a random walk to diffuse uncertainty. The random walk diffusion regularizes the non-conformity scores, making the prediction sets less sensitive to the conformal calibration parameter $λ$, ensuring more stable and continuous anatomical boundaries. RW-CP maintains rigorous marginal coverage while significantly improving segmentation quality. Evaluations on multi-modal public datasets show improvements of up to $35.4\%$ compared to standard CP baselines, given an allowable error rate of $α=0.1$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性伤口监测需要精确高效的测量方法，但传统测量方法往往不够准确或效率低下，因此需要开发自动化的3D伤口评估工具

Method: 使用RGB-D图像，结合RGB-D里程计进行位姿估计和点云配准，然后利用B样条曲面重建生成详细的3D伤口网格，自动计算伤口周长、表面积和维度等临床相关参数

Result: 在真实硅胶伤口模型上验证，相比高分辨率基准扫描实现亚毫米级3D重建精度；测量结果在重复采集间变异性低，与手动评估结果吻合良好；在保持实时临床部署运行时间的同时，优于现有最先进的以物体为中心的RGB-D重建方法

Conclusion: 该方法为临床和远程医疗环境中的自动化伤口评估提供了一个有前景的工具，具有高精度和临床实用性

Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出神经皮质地图（neural cortical maps），一种可替代传统网格结构的连续紧凑神经表征，能从任意尺寸网格学习并提供任意分辨率的特征，在球面上实现高效优化，速度比经典重心插值快30倍。提出了NC-Reg皮质刚性配准算法，结合梯度下降和模拟退火，实现亚度级精度（<1°），可作为临床环境中稳健的预对齐策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统皮质特征图通常使用离散结构（如网格），缺乏连续性和灵活性，难以高效处理不同分辨率数据。临床应用中需要稳健、准确的皮质表面配准方法，当前方法在效率和精度方面存在局限。

Method: 1. 提出神经皮质地图：连续紧凑的神经表征，可学习任意尺寸网格特征 2. 开发NC-Reg算法：使用神经皮质特征图的迭代配准方法，结合梯度下降优化和模拟退火策略 3. 在球面上进行高效优化，避免传统离散结构的计算瓶颈

Conclusion: 神经皮质地图提供了一种连续、紧凑且高效的皮质表征方式，突破了传统离散结构的限制。NC-Reg算法实现了高精度皮质配准，速度快、稳健性强，特别适合临床应用中的预对齐需求，为皮质分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($<1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NuiWorld框架旨在解决世界生成中的可控性、可扩展性和效率问题，通过生成式引导策略从少量图像合成多样化场景数据，并利用可变场景块和扁平向量集表示来提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界生成方法面临可控性、可扩展性和效率三大障碍：端到端场景生成模型受数据稀缺限制；以对象为中心的方法依赖固定分辨率表示，大场景保真度下降；无训练方法在推理时通常缓慢且计算量大。

Method: 1. 提出生成式引导策略，从少量输入图像出发，结合3D重建和可扩展场景生成技术合成多种尺度和布局的场景数据。2. 通过伪草图标签实现可控性。3. 将场景表示为可变场景块的集合，压缩为扁平向量集表示，显著减少大场景的标记长度。

Conclusion: NuiWorld框架通过生成式数据合成、伪草图可控性和高效向量集表示，综合解决了世界生成中的关键挑战，为游戏、仿真和机器人等应用提供了更实用的场景生成方案。

Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixSearch是一个端到端的可分割大型多模态模型，首次将区域级感知与检索增强推理统一起来，通过像素级掩码直接作为视觉查询，无需依赖传统的模块化pipeline，显著提升了VQA任务的factual consistency和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态检索增强生成(MM-RAG)系统虽然在事实基础上有所改进，但缺乏何时以及如何检索的内部策略机制。视觉问答(VQA)任务需要将细粒度感知与超出输入图像的事实知识相结合，传统方法依赖检测器、分割器、字幕生成器等模块化pipeline，存在效率和数据流问题。

Method: PixSearch是一个端到端的Segmenting Large Multimodal Model，在编码过程中通过生成<search>token来触发检索，选择查询模态（文本、图像或区域），并生成直接作为视觉查询的像素级掩码。采用两阶段监督微调策略，通过检索交错监督来学习检索时机和查询选择，同时保持分割能力。

Result: 在自我中心式和实体中心式VQA基准测试中，PixSearch显著提高了事实一致性和泛化能力，在CRAG-MM上相比整张图像检索实现了19.7%的相对准确度提升，同时在各种VQA和纯文本QA任务上保持了竞争力的推理性能。

Conclusion: PixSearch成功将区域级感知与检索增强推理统一到一个端到端模型中，通过像素级分割掩码作为检索查询，实现了比传统模块化方法更优的检索时机控制和查询选择，为多模态检索增强系统提供了新的有效架构。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.

*Yosub Shin,Michael Buriek,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了m2sv基准测试，用于评估视觉-语言模型在面向真实世界场景的地图到街景的空间推理任务表现，模型表现明显低于人类基准，突显了其在几何对齐、证据整合和推理一致性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉-语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现强劲，但在需要将抽象俯视图与第一人称视图对齐的空间推理任务上依然脆弱。需要建立能准确评估模型在真实世界场景中地理空间推理能力的基准。

Method: 引入m2sv作为地图到街景空间推理的可扩展基准，要求模型通过对齐正北向上的俯视地图与同一真实世界十字路口拍摄的街景图像来推断相机朝向。发布了m2sv-20k基准数据集和m2sv-sft-11k监督微调集合。

Result: 在m2sv基准上，最佳视觉-语言模型仅达到65.2%准确率，远低于人类基准的95%。监督微调和强化学习带来一致收益，但跨基准评估显示泛化能力有限。通过结构信号和人工标注进行了系统性难度分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明模型在地图到街景推理任务上存在持续的几何对齐、证据整合和推理一致性方面的差距，这推动未来需要在跨视角的接地空间推理方面进行更多研究。

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

TL;DR: Reg-TTR：一个测试时精炼框架，结合深度学习的高效与传统方法的精准，提升图像配准质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像配准方法鲁棒但计算耗时，深度学习模型提升了推理速度但泛化差，而新兴的配准基础模型在速度和鲁棒性间取得了平衡，但在特定数据集上的精度仍不及专用模型。Reg-TTR旨在利用这两类方法的优势，通过在推理时对预训练模型进行精炼，以提高配准精度，同时控制计算成本。

Method: Reg-TTR 是一个测试时精炼框架：1）在推理阶段对预训练模型（尤其是配准基础模型）的预测结果进行精炼；2）整合深度学习的高效性和传统迭代方法的准确性；3）只需约21%的额外推理时间（0.56秒）。

Result: 在两个不同的配准任务上评估，Reg-TTR 达到了 SOTA 性能，推理速度仍接近先前的深度学习方法，平均准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: Reg-TTR 有效地缩小了配准基础模型与专用数据集训练的 SOTA 方法之间的性能差距，为未来的配准基础模型提供了一种高效的精炼策略。

Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.

Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.

TL;DR: 针对开放世界目标检测中因果因素难以区分的问题，提出基于粒度球视角的域对抗学习改进方法GB-DAL，通过原型粒度球分裂和模拟非因果因素模块提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域泛化方法主要学习域不变信息，但往往忽视了潜在的非因果因素。这源于两个关键原因：1）基于域判别器的域对抗学习方法只能关联显性非因果因子，信息有限；2）非因果因素过于隐含，传统域对抗学习范式难以单独识别。

Method: 提出GB-DAL方法：1）PGBS模块通过原型粒度球分裂从有限数据集中生成更密集的域，揭示更多潜在非因果因素；2）SNF模块作为数据增强手段模拟非因果因素，降低其隐含性，促进GB-DAL训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的比较实验表明，该方法在新环境中实现了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于粒度球视角改进域对抗学习能更有效地揭示和处理开放世界目标检测中的非因果因素，提升模型在未知领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.

Abstract: Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.

Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.

Conclusion: QA-ReID通过异构特征融合和质量感知自适应匹配，有效提升了换装行人重识别的鲁棒性和准确性

Abstract: Unlike conventional person re-identification (ReID), clothes-changing ReID (CC-ReID) presents severe challenges due to substantial appearance variations introduced by clothing changes. In this work, we propose the Quality-Aware Dual-Branch Matching (QA-ReID), which jointly leverages RGB-based features and parsing-based representations to model both global appearance and clothing-invariant structural cues. These heterogeneous features are adaptively fused through a multi-modal attention module. At the matching stage, we further design the Quality-Aware Query Adaptive Convolution (QAConv-QA), which incorporates pixel-level importance weighting and bidirectional consistency constraints to enhance robustness against clothing variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QA-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, and significantly outperforms existing approaches under cross-clothing scenarios.

Method: 提出训练无关的SNR-Edit框架，通过自适应噪声控制实现忠实的潜在轨迹校正，使用结构感知噪声修正将分割约束注入初始噪声，锚定源轨迹的随机分量到真实图像的隐式反转位置

Result: 在SD3和FLUX模型上的PIE-Bench和SNR-Bench评估表明，SNR-Edit在像素级指标和VLM评分上表现优异，每张图像仅增加约1秒开销

Conclusion: SNR-Edit通过轻量级修改产生更平滑的潜在轨迹，确保高保真结构保留，无需模型调整或反转操作

Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得合成图像极为逼真，引发了数字媒体真实性信任问题。虽然深度学习方法是当前主流，但手工特征具有可解释性、高效性和通用性等优势，需要系统评估其在合成图像检测中的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

Deep models trained on ASFW demonstrate improved shadow removal in real-world conditions. We also introduce the Face Shadow Eraser (FSE) method to showcase the effectiveness of the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ASFW enhances the performance of facial shadow removal models, setting new standards for this task.

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

Abstract: Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

TL;DR: 本文提出了X-AIGD基准测试，首次为AI生成图像检测提供像素级分类注释，揭示了现有检测器很少依赖可解释的感知伪影，并表明显式调整模型注意力可提升可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法主要基于二元分类，缺乏可解释的证据支持决策。现有基准数据集覆盖伪影多样性不足且缺乏详细的局部标注，限制了可解释性评估。

Conclusion: X-AIGD基准为AI生成图像检测的可解释性研究提供了重要工具，研究结果表明现有检测器缺乏对可解释特征的有效利用，而注意力对齐是提升可解释性的有效方向。

Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前自主无人机林业作业需要具有强跨域泛化能力的深度估计，但现有评估主要关注城市和室内场景，忽略了植被密集环境这一关键领域。因此，需要首次系统性地评估各种立体深度估计方法在零样本设置下，特别是针对森林场景的泛化能力。

Method: 研究者在零样本设置下评估了八种立体深度估计方法，涵盖迭代优化、基础模型、扩散模型和3D CNN等不同范式。所有方法均使用官方发布的预训练权重（在Scene Flow数据集上训练），并在四个标准基准（ETH3D、KITTI 2012/2015、Middlebury）和一个新的包含5,313对1920×1080图像对的Canterbury Tree Branches数据集上进行评估。

Result: 结果表明性能具有场景依赖性：基础模型在结构化场景上表现优异（BridgeDepth在ETH3D上的误差为0.23像素；DEFOM在Middlebury上的误差为4.65像素），而迭代方法在不同基准上的表现差异较大（IGEV++在ETH3D上的误差为0.36像素但在Middlebury上为6.77像素）。在Tree Branches数据集的定性评估中，DEFOM展现出最优秀的跨域一致性（在所有基准上排名1-2位，平均排名1.75），因此被确立为植被深度估计的黄金标准基线。

Conclusion: DEFOM在跨域深度估计一致性方面表现最佳，特别是在植被密集环境中。作者宣布DEFOM的预测结果将作为未来基准测试的伪地面真值，为无人机林业操作中的深度估计提供了可靠的基线方法。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

TL;DR: ENkG (Entropy-Guided k-Guard) 采样策略通过根据视频标记的熵自适应调整候选集大小，解决了静态 top-k/top-p 策略在视频生成中的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型中，token具有高语义密度和低冗余，静态top-k/top-p策略能很好平衡准确性和多样性。然而视频token具有低语义密度和高时空冗余，静态策略要么在低不确定性区域（静态背景）引入不必要随机性，要么在高不确定性区域（前景对象）陷入早期错误，导致长时生成质量下降。

Method: 提出基于熵的k-Guard采样策略：1）计算每个标记预测分布的熵来衡量其分散度；2）对低熵区域使用较少候选以减少冗余噪声；3）对高熵区域使用更多候选以缓解错误累积；4）策略是模型无关、无需训练、开销极低。

Result: 实验表明，与静态top-k/top-p策略相比，ENkG能一致提升感知质量和结构稳定性，在长时视频生成中表现更优。

Conclusion: ENkG采样通过自适应调节候选集大小，能够更好地匹配视频token的特性，有效解决视频生成中的错误累积问题，是一种简单有效的改进策略。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

Conclusion: Cor2Vox实现了解剖学一致的合成、模拟渐进性灰质萎缩和数据集协调的应用，展示了其在生成真实脑形状和保持皮层形态方面的有效性。

Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ScenePilot-Bench, a large-scale first-person driving benchmark designed to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving scenarios. ScenePilot-Bench is built upon ScenePilot-4K, a diverse dataset comprising 3,847 hours of driving videos, annotated with multi-granularity information including scene descriptions, risk assessments, key participant identification, ego trajectories, and camera parameters. The benchmark features a four-axis evaluation suite that assesses VLM capabilities in scene understanding, spatial perception, motion planning, and GPT-Score, with safety-aware metrics and cross-region generalization settings. We benchmark representative VLMs on ScenePilot-Bench, providing empirical analyses that clarify current performance boundaries and identify gaps for driving-oriented reasoning. ScenePilot-Bench offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing VLMs in safety-critical autonomous driving contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个局部潜在编辑框架，通过剂量-响应建模模拟肉毒毒素注射效果，用于注射规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肉毒毒素注射是面部不对称管理和美学年轻化的黄金标准，但确定最佳剂量主要依赖经验，常导致次优结果。

Method: 开发了区域特定潜在轴发现方法，在StyleGAN2潜在空间中学习局部肌肉放松轨迹，将局部潜在轨迹与注射毒素单位相关联，学习预测性剂量-响应模型。

Result: 在包含N=360张图像、46名患者的临床数据集上验证，保持测试集显示几何不对称指标的中等到强结构相关性，生成模型正确捕捉了形态变化方向。

Conclusion: 虽然生物变异性限制了绝对精度，但提出的混合"人在环路"工作流程让临床医生交互式优化模拟，弥补了病理重建与美容规划之间的差距。

Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMS-CAVP融合多尺度对比学习和扩散生成目标来增强音视频对应建模，在多个基准数据集上超越了先前方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音视频联合嵌入方法（如CAVP）在建模语义和时间对应关系方面仍不理想，主要受限于未能充分建模音视频的密集多尺度特性，这些对应关系经常跨越细粒度到粗粒度的时空结构

Method: 1. 提出多尺度对比学习策略，捕捉不同粒度下的语义和时间关系；2. 超越传统对比学习，引入基于扩散的生成目标，实现音视频之间的模态转换和合成

Result: 在VGGSound、AudioSet和Panda70M上的广泛实验表明，GMS-CAVP在生成和检索任务上超越了先前方法

Conclusion: 这种统一的判别-生成式框架促进了更深层次的跨模态理解，并为高保真生成铺平了道路

Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

TL;DR: 本文对差分隐私医疗影像分析的初始化策略进行了大规模评估，发现领域特定监督预训练在保持隐私的同时最接近非私有基线性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 差分隐私在保护敏感数据的同时通常会导致诊断性能显著下降，模型初始化是缓解这种退化的关键因素，但目前现代自监督学习在全模型差分隐私下的作用尚未得到清楚理解

Method: 在超过80万张胸片分类基准上使用最先进的ConvNeXt模型，通过DP-SGD训练，比较三种初始化策略：非领域特定监督ImageNet初始化、非领域特定自监督DINOv3初始化、领域特定监督MIMIC-CXR预训练，并在五个外部数据集上进行评估

Result: DINOv3初始化在差分隐私下相对ImageNet初始化持续提升诊断效用，但仍不如领域特定监督预训练，后者实现了最接近非私有基线的性能。初始化选择还强烈影响人口统计公平性、跨数据集泛化以及数据规模和模型容量在隐私约束下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 初始化策略是差分隐私医疗影像分析中效用、公平性和泛化能力的关键决定因素

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

Conclusion: 论文通过建立管理导向的基准和统一推理框架，为智能城市治理的低空视觉系统提供了创新解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一个旨在平衡预训练VLMs持续学习中三大冲突目标（保留预训练知识、学习新任务知识、保持模型可塑性）的方法，通过分析参数空间不同子空间承载不同类型知识的特性，在残差子空间学习新任务，避免干扰已学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习的核心挑战在于同时处理三个互相冲突的目标：保留预训练模型的已有知识、在新任务序列中保护已学任务的知识、并保持学习新知识的能力。传统方法往往难以有效平衡这三者。

Method: 提出KeepLoRA方法，首先分析发现预训练知识主要编码在参数空间的主成分子空间，而任务特定知识在残差子空间。学习新任务时，通过将梯度投影到与预训练主成分子空间和之前任务的dominant directions正交的子空间上，使LoRA参数的更新限制在残差子空间内，从而避免干扰已学习能力。

Result: 理论和实验分析均证明KeepLoRA能够有效平衡三大目标，在多个基准测试上达到state-of-the-art性能。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过利用参数子空间特性来分离不同类型知识，KeepLoRA为预训练视觉语言模型提供了一个简单有效的持续学习解决方案，成功平衡了知识保留与学习能力的维持。

Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像相似度度量方法缺乏感知性，尤其在纹理扭曲存在时表现不佳，且多数深度黑箱方法仅提供相似度分数而缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出包含两个分量的感知度量：1）使用Earth Mover's Distance评估纹理差异；2）在Oklab感知颜色空间中评估色度差异；在Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity数据集上进行评估。

Result: 该度量在包含复杂形状和颜色扭曲的数据集上优于当前最佳方法，特别是在形状扭曲情况下表现出更强的感知性；同时提供可视化解释使相似度评估更透明。

Conclusion: 该感知度量方法在评估图像相似度时，尤其在形状扭曲情况下优于现有技术，并通过提供可视化解释增强了评估过程的透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) are a standard tool for learning and function approximation, but they inherently yield outputs that are globally smooth. As a result, they struggle to represent functions that are continuous yet deliberately non-differentiable (i.e., with prescribed $C^0$ sharp features) without relying on ad hoc post-processing. We present SharpNet, a modified MLP architecture capable of encoding functions with user-defined sharp features by enriching the network with an auxiliary feature function, which is defined as the solution to a Poisson equation with jump Neumann boundary conditions. It is evaluated via an efficient local integral that is fully differentiable with respect to the feature locations, enabling our method to jointly optimize both the feature locations and the MLP parameters to recover the target functions/models. The $C^0$-continuity of SharpNet is precisely controllable, ensuring $C^0$-continuity at the feature locations and smoothness elsewhere. We validate SharpNet on 2D problems and 3D CAD model reconstruction, and compare it against several state-of-the-art baselines. In both types of tasks, SharpNet accurately recovers sharp edges and corners while maintaining smooth behavior away from those features, whereas existing methods tend to smooth out gradient discontinuities. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations highlight the benefits of our approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zywang0104/Video-KTR.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Motivation: 现有AVQA方法主要关注视觉信息处理，音频仅作为视频分析的补充，且文本问题信息通常只在推理最后阶段才整合，未能充分发挥音频和问题的指导作用

Method: QSTar方法在查询引导下结合音频信号的频域特征以及空间和时间感知；QCR模块通过类似提示的方法引导模型聚焦语义相关的音频和视觉特征

Result: 在多个AVQA基准测试上超越现有音频QA、视觉QA、视频QA和AVQA方法，取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了AVQA任务中多模态信息的联合推理能力，特别是增强了音频特征处理和问题引导的多模态理解

Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

Conclusion: EgoHandICL通过上下文学习框架有效解决了一人称视角手部重建的挑战，在多个基准上取得显著提升，并展示了在真实场景和下游任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

TL;DR: VGGT-SLAM 2.0是一个实时RGB前馈SLAM系统，通过对VGGT-SLAM进行多项改进，包括消除高维漂移和平面退化、利用注意力层进行图像检索验证，并在各种环境及TUM数据集上展示了卓越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进原始VGGT-SLAM系统存在的问题：高维自由度漂移和平面退化，相机内参未知导致的VGGT重建模糊性，并提升SLAM系统的准确性、鲁棒性和实时性能。

Method: 1. 设计新的因子图结构来消除15自由度漂移和平面退化，同时处理未知相机内参下的VGGT重建问题。
2. 研究VGGT的注意力层，利用特定层进行无额外训练的免费图像检索验证，以拒绝错误匹配并完成更多闭环。
3. 在实际环境中进行实时测试，并展示系统对开放集对象检测的适应性。

Result: 1. 在TUM数据集上实现最高精度，位姿误差比VGGT-SLAM减少约23%。
2. 成功在室内公寓、办公室到4200平方英尺的谷仓等各种环境下运行。
3. 在Jetson Thor平台上实现实时在线性能。

Conclusion: VGGT-SLAM 2.0通过创新的因子图设计和利用VGGT注意力层特性，显著提升了SLAM系统的精度、鲁棒性和实用性能，在各种复杂环境下均表现出色，并在标准数据集上达到了最佳性能。

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出DuwatBench基准，包含1272个阿拉伯书法样本，评估了13个多模态模型对艺术化阿拉伯文字的识别能力，发现现有模型在书法变体上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在处理阿拉伯文字，特别是艺术化、风格化的书法形式上存在明显不足，需要专门的评估基准来推动这一领域的文化适应性研究。

Method: 创建包含1272个样本的DuwatBench数据集，涵盖6种古典和现代阿拉伯书法风格，每个样本配有句子级检测标注。使用该数据集评估13个阿拉伯语和多语言多模态模型。

Result: 现有模型在清晰文本上表现良好，但在处理书法变体、艺术变形和视觉-文本对齐方面存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 通过公开发布DuwatBench数据集和评估套件，旨在推动文化基础的多模态研究，促进阿拉伯语言和视觉遗产在AI系统中的公平包容性。

Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了基于语言谱系的连接器共享策略，为每个语言家族使用一个连接器而非每个语言单独训练，从而降低参数数量并提升跨领域泛化能力，在多语言大语言模型和真实语料上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型驱动的语音识别系统通常为每种语言单独训练连接器，忽视了语言之间的亲缘关系，导致参数效率低下且无法充分利用语言间的相似性。

Method: 提出基于语言家族归属的高效连接器共享策略，将同一语言家族（如印欧语系、汉藏语系等）的语言共享一个连接器，减少训练参数数量。

Result: 在两个多语言大语言模型和两个真实世界语料库（包括精心整理和众包语音）上的实验表明，家族化连接器在减少参数的同时，提高了模型在不同领域的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于语言家族的连接器共享策略为多语言语音识别部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了参数效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems achieve strong performance with limited resources by linking a frozen speech encoder to a pretrained LLM via a lightweight connector. Prior work trains a separate connector per language, overlooking linguistic relatedness. We propose an efficient and novel connector-sharing strategy based on linguistic family membership, enabling one connector per family, and empirically validate its effectiveness across two multilingual LLMs and two real-world corpora spanning curated and crowd-sourced speech. Our results show that family-based connectors reduce parameter count while improving generalization across domains, offering a practical and scalable strategy for multilingual ASR deployment.

Abstract: Knowledge probing quantifies how much relational knowledge a language model (LM) has acquired during pre-training. Existing knowledge probes evaluate model capabilities through metrics like prediction accuracy and precision. Such evaluations fail to account for the model's reliability, reflected in the calibration of its confidence scores. In this paper, we propose a novel calibration probing framework for relational knowledge, covering three modalities of model confidence: (1) intrinsic confidence, (2) structural consistency and (3) semantic grounding. Our extensive analysis of ten causal and six masked language models reveals that most models, especially those pre-trained with the masking objective, are overconfident. The best-calibrated scores come from confidence estimates that account for inconsistencies due to statement rephrasing. Moreover, even the largest pre-trained models fail to encode the semantics of linguistic confidence expressions accurately.

*Jiaming Fan,Daming Cao,Xiangzhong Luo,Jiale Fu,Chonghan Liu,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过数据筛选提高推测解码训练效率的方法——基于样本平坦度的数据集蒸馏（SFDD），利用目标模型预测分布的平坦度指标筛选训练数据，仅用50%数据达到2倍训练加速，同时保持推理速度接近全数据基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码（Speculative Decoding）加速大语言模型推理通常需要在大数据集上训练草稿模型，但并非所有训练样本对SD接受率的贡献都相同。研究发现：诱导目标模型产生更平坦预测分布的token比产生峰值尖锐分布的token更有价值。

Method: 提出平坦度（flatness）指标量化样本价值，开发基于样本平坦度的数据集蒸馏（SFDD）方法，通过筛选训练数据保留最有价值的样本。在EAGLE框架上进行实验验证。

Result: SFDD仅使用50%的训练数据就能实现超过2倍的训练加速，同时最终模型的推理加速仅比全数据集基线低4%。

Conclusion: 这项工作提出了一种有效的、以数据为中心的方法，显著提高了推测解码的训练效率，为加速推理系统的开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a key technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference, but it typically requires training a draft model on a large dataset. We approach this problem from a data-centric perspective, finding that not all training samples contribute equally to the SD acceptance rate. Specifically, our theoretical analysis and empirical validation reveals that tokens inducing flatter predictive distributions from the target model are more valuable than those yielding sharply peaked distributions. Based on this insight, we propose flatness, a new metric to quantify this property, and develop the Sample-level-flatness-based Dataset Distillation (SFDD) approach, which filters the training data to retain only the most valuable samples. Experiments on the EAGLE framework demonstrate that SFDD can achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup using only 50% of the data, while keeping the final model's inference speedup within 4% of the full-dataset baseline. This work introduces an effective, data-centric approach that substantially improves the training efficiency for Speculative Decoding.

TL;DR: 该研究针对传统语言模型评估主要关注成人化基准的问题，构建了基于发展心理学经典范式的婴儿推理基准测试BabyReasoningBench，评估在儿童导向语料上训练的小规模语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型评估基准以成人认知为中心，预设了广泛的世界知识、复杂指令理解和成熟语用能力，这与在儿童发展可信输入（如儿童导向语音和幼儿叙事）上训练的婴儿语言模型不匹配，无法揭示在这种约束条件下哪些推理能力能够出现。

Method: 作者引入了BabyReasoningBench，这是一个由GPT-5.2生成的基准测试，包含19个基于发展心理学经典范式的推理任务，涵盖心理理论、类比和关系推理、因果推断和干预选择、以及易受记忆和语用因素混淆的核心推理原语，并测试了两个基于GPT-2架构、在不同规模（1000万和1亿词）儿童导向文本上预训练的婴儿语言模型。

Result: 研究发现，两个婴儿语言模型总体上表现较低但在不同任务上存在差异：模型规模的扩大改善了多个因果推理和物理推理任务的表现，但信念归因和对语用敏感的任务仍然具有挑战性。不同任务家族之间存在解离现象。

Conclusion: BabyReasoningBench为分析儿童类似训练分布支持何种推理能力提供了一个发展心理学基础的分析框架，并为测试这些能力如何出现的机制假设提供了工具。

Abstract: Traditional evaluations of reasoning capabilities of language models are dominated by adult-centric benchmarks that presuppose broad world knowledge, complex instruction following, and mature pragmatic competence. These assumptions are mismatched to baby language models trained on developmentally plausible input such as child-directed speech and early-childhood narratives, and they obscure which reasoning abilities (if any) emerge under such constraints. We introduce BabyReasoningBench, a GPT-5.2 generated benchmark of 19 reasoning tasks grounded in classic paradigms from developmental psychology, spanning theory of mind, analogical and relational reasoning, causal inference and intervention selection, and core reasoning primitives that are known to be confounded by memory and pragmatics. We find that two GPT-2 based baby language models (pretrained on 10M and 100M of child-directed speech text) show overall low but uneven performance, with dissociations across task families: scaling improves several causal and physical reasoning tasks, while belief attribution and pragmatics-sensitive tasks remain challenging. BabyReasoningBench provides a developmentally grounded lens for analyzing what kinds of reasoning are supported by child-like training distributions, and for testing mechanistic hypotheses about how such abilities emerge.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）预测C程序终止性（一个不可判定问题）的能力。研究发现，LLMs在SV-Comp 2025的终止比赛数据集上表现优秀，GPT-5和Claude等模型性能接近顶级验证工具，但存在无法提供有效证明、程序长度增加时性能下降等局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图灵停机问题的不可判定性意味着没有通用算法能判定所有程序的终止性。现有验证工具通常依赖于特定架构、抽象和编程语言，且可能失败。我们想探索基于大规模训练、具备通用推理能力的LLMs是否能可靠地预测程序终止。

Method: 我们在国际软件验证竞赛（SV-Comp）2025的终止类别中，选取了一系列多样化的C程序。我们评估了几个先进LLMs，包括GPT-5、Claude Sonnet-4.5和Code World Model（CWM），在预测这些程序终止性上的性能，并分析了其有效性证明能力和对程序长度的敏感性。

Result: LLMs在预测程序终止性上表现卓越：GPT-5和Claude的性能在测试时扩展后接近排名第一的工具，而CWM则接近排名第二的工具。然而，LLMs往往无法提供有效的证明作为见证，并且随着程序长度的增加，其性能会下降。

Conclusion: LLMs在应对不可判定的终止性预测问题上显示出巨大潜力，并且可能为更广泛的不可判定问题的推理开辟新途径。但当前模型在提供证明、应对长程序等方面仍有不足，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究聚焦LLM在促进科学发现方面的潜力，但缺乏对其被恶意利用、改造开放科学构件以产生有害研究的风险的系统评估。

Method: 构建端到端管道：1）通过说服式越狱绕过LLM安全机制；2）重新解读NLP论文，识别并利用其构件的脆弱性进行恶意改造；3）建立评估框架，从危害性、滥用可行性、技术合理性三个维度评估生成提案的安全性。

Result: LLM可通过改造伦理设计的开放构件生成有害提案。但不同LLM（GPT-4.1评分更高，Gemini-2.5-pro更严格，Grok-3居中）在评估结果上存在显著分歧，表明LLM尚无法作为恶意评估的可靠评判者。

Conclusion: LLM能生成利用开放构件的有害研究提案，但LLM评估者之间的不一致性表明，对于可信的军民两用风险评估，仍需人工评估介入。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has fuelled enthusiasm about their role in advancing scientific discovery, with studies exploring LLMs that autonomously generate and evaluate novel research ideas. However, little attention has been given to the possibility that such models could be exploited to produce harmful research by repurposing open science artefacts for malicious ends. We fill the gap by introducing an end-to-end pipeline that first bypasses LLM safeguards through persuasion-based jailbreaking, then reinterprets NLP papers to identify and repurpose their artefacts (datasets, methods, and tools) by exploiting their vulnerabilities, and finally assesses the safety of these proposals using our evaluation framework across three dimensions: harmfulness, feasibility of misuse, and soundness of technicality. Overall, our findings demonstrate that LLMs can generate harmful proposals by repurposing ethically designed open artefacts; however, we find that LLMs acting as evaluators strongly disagree with one another on evaluation outcomes: GPT-4.1 assigns higher scores (indicating greater potential harms, higher soundness and feasibility of misuse), Gemini-2.5-pro is markedly stricter, and Grok-3 falls between these extremes. This indicates that LLMs cannot yet serve as reliable judges in a malicious evaluation setup, making human evaluation essential for credible dual-use risk assessment.

Motivation: 传统推理方法存在冗余和不稳定路径，导致推理效率低下且可靠性不足。FROSTMotivation旨在通过注意力机制识别并剪枝不重要的推理路径，从而产生更短、更可靠的推理轨迹

Method: <invalid>

Result: 在四个基准测试上使用Phi-4-Reasoning和GPT-OSS-20B模型验证，超越TALE和ThinkLess等现有方法，平均减少69.68% token使用，提升26.70%准确率。注意力异常指标方面，最大无穷范数降低15.97%，平均峰度减少91.09%

Conclusion: FROST通过注意力感知的推理路径剪枝，在保持并增强模型推理能力的同时，大幅提升了推理效率和可靠性，为高效推理提供了新方法

Abstract: We propose FROST, an attention-aware method for efficient reasoning. Unlike traditional approaches, FROST leverages attention weights to prune uncritical reasoning paths, yielding shorter and more reliable reasoning trajectories. Methodologically, we introduce the concept of reasoning outliers and design an attention-based mechanism to remove them. Theoretically, FROST preserves and enhances the model's reasoning capacity while eliminating outliers at the sentence level. Empirically, we validate FROST on four benchmarks using two strong reasoning models (Phi-4-Reasoning and GPT-OSS-20B), outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as TALE and ThinkLess. Notably, FROST achieves an average 69.68% reduction in token usage and a 26.70% improvement in accuracy over the base model. Furthermore, in evaluations of attention outlier metrics, FROST reduces the maximum infinity norm by 15.97% and the average kurtosis by 91.09% compared to the base model.

Motivation: 现有语音对话系统的RLHF/RLAIF方法主要局限于单一语义奖励且应用于完整话语层面，忽略了对话质量的多维性和多模态特性，也不适合需要增量生成的复式对话系统。

Method: 通过结合语义、音频质量和情感一致性奖励构建多奖励RLAIF框架；采用回合级偏好采样和按块累积对数概率的策略，在单一DPO目标中实现与增量解码的对齐。

Result: 实验表明单一奖励RLAIF仅能提升其针对性指标，而联合多奖励训练能在语义质量和音频自然度上均获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 多奖励对齐对于构建实用的对话型语音系统至关重要，该研究为此提供了系统性框架和可复现的数据集。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback (RLHF/RLAIF) for speech-in/speech-out dialogue systems (SDS) remains underexplored, with prior work largely limited to single semantic rewards applied at the utterance level. Such setups overlook the multi-dimensional and multi-modal nature of conversational quality, which encompasses semantic coherence, audio naturalness, speaker consistency, emotion alignment, and turn-taking behavior. Moreover, they are fundamentally mismatched with duplex spoken dialogue systems that generate responses incrementally, where agents must make decisions based on partial utterances. We address these limitations with the first multi-reward RLAIF framework for SDS, combining semantic, audio-quality, and emotion-consistency rewards. To align utterance-level preferences with incremental, blockwise decoding in duplex models, we apply turn-level preference sampling and aggregate per-block log-probabilities within a single DPO objective. We present the first systematic study of preference learning for improving SDS quality in both multi-turn Chain-of-Thought and blockwise duplex models, and release a multi-reward DPO dataset to support reproducible research. Experiments show that single-reward RLAIF selectively improves its targeted metric, while joint multi-reward training yields consistent gains across semantic quality and audio naturalness. These results highlight the importance of holistic, multi-reward alignment for practical conversational SDS.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled mental health dialogue systems, yet existing approaches remain predominantly reactive, lacking systematic user state modeling for proactive therapeutic exploration. We introduce PsyProbe, a dialogue system designed for the exploration phase of counseling that systematically tracks user psychological states through the PPPPPI framework (Presenting, Predisposing, Precipitating, Perpetuating, Protective, Impact) augmented with cognitive error detection. PsyProbe combines State Builder for extracting structured psychological profiles, Memory Construction for tracking information gaps, Strategy Planner for Motivational Interviewing behavioral codes, and Response Generator with Question Ideation and Critic/Revision modules to generate contextually appropriate, proactive questions. We evaluate PsyProbe with 27 participants in real-world Korean counseling scenarios, including automatic evaluation across ablation modes, user evaluation, and expert evaluation by a certified counselor. The full PsyProbe model consistently outperforms baseline and ablation modes in automatic evaluation. User evaluation demonstrates significantly increased engagement intention and improved naturalness compared to baseline.

Abstract: We introduce TeMLM, a set of transparency-first release artifacts for clinical language models. TeMLM unifies provenance, data transparency, modeling transparency, and governance into a single, machine-checkable release bundle. We define an artifact suite (TeMLM-Card, TeMLM-Datasheet, TeMLM-Provenance) and a lightweight conformance checklist for repeatable auditing. We instantiate the artifacts on Technetium-I, a large-scale synthetic clinical NLP dataset with 498,000 notes, 7.74M PHI entity annotations across 10 types, and ICD-9-CM diagnosis labels, and report reference results for ProtactiniumBERT (about 100 million parameters) on PHI de-identification (token classification) and top-50 ICD-9 code extraction (multi-label classification). We emphasize that synthetic benchmarks are valuable for tooling and process validation, but models should be validated on real clinical data prior to deployment.

Motivation: 当前VLM在VQA基准上展现强大多模态推理能力，但对其抗文本误导攻击的鲁棒性研究不足，尤其是文本与视觉证据冲突时的决策机制尚不明确。

Method: 1) 构建CONTEXT-VQA数据集（含图像-问题对及与视觉证据系统冲突的误导性文本提示 2) 设计鲁棒性评估框架 3) 在11个SOTA VLM上进行系统性实验分析对抗攻击下的表现。

Result: 所有VLM均对误导文本表现出显著易感性：1) 常优先采纳冲突文本而非清楚视觉证据 2) 仅一轮说服性对话即导致平均性能下降48.2% 3) 揭示当前模型对文本操控的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 现代VLM存在对抗文本攻击的严重鲁棒性缺陷，亟需开发增强跨模态矛盾分辨能力的防御机制以确保可靠AI决策。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on Visual-Question-Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, their robustness against textual misinformation remains under-explored. While existing research has studied the effect of misinformation in text-only domains, it is not clear how VLMs arbitrate between contradictory information from different modalities. To bridge the gap, we first propose the CONTEXT-VQA (i.e., Conflicting Text) dataset, consisting of image-question pairs together with systematically generated persuasive prompts that deliberately conflict with visual evidence. Then, a thorough evaluation framework is designed and executed to benchmark the susceptibility of various models to these conflicting multimodal inputs. Comprehensive experiments over 11 state-of-the-art VLMs reveal that these models are indeed vulnerable to misleading textual prompts, often overriding clear visual evidence in favor of the conflicting text, and show an average performance drop of over 48.2% after only one round of persuasive conversation. Our findings highlight a critical limitation in current VLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against textual manipulation.

Abstract: Semantic associations such as the link between "bird" and "flew" are foundational for language modeling as they enable models to go beyond memorization and instead generalize and generate coherent text. Understanding how these associations are learned and represented in language models is essential for connecting deep learning with linguistic theory and developing a mechanistic foundation for large language models. In this work, we analyze how these associations emerge from natural language data in attention-based language models through the lens of training dynamics. By leveraging a leading-term approximation of the gradients, we develop closed-form expressions for the weights at early stages of training that explain how semantic associations first take shape. Through our analysis, we reveal that each set of weights of the transformer has closed-form expressions as simple compositions of three basis functions (bigram, token-interchangeability, and context mappings), reflecting the statistics of the text corpus and uncovering how each component of the transformer captures semantic associations based on these compositions. Experiments on real-world LLMs demonstrate that our theoretical weight characterizations closely match the learned weights, and qualitative analyses further show how our theorem shines light on interpreting the learned associations in transformers.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RPO-RAG框架，专门针对小型LLMs在知识图谱问答中的性能提升，通过结合语义采样、关系感知优化和答案中心提示设计，显著缩小了大小模型间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法存在语义感知不足、与推理目标对齐弱、路径组织不佳等问题，且大多依赖大型语言模型，对参数小于7B的小型模型研究不足，限制了其在资源受限场景的应用。

Method: 提出了RPO-RAG框架，包含三个关键创新：1) 查询路径语义采样策略；2) 关系感知偏好优化；3) 答案中心的提示设计。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ两个KGQA基准测试中表现优异：WebQSP上F1提升最高8.8%；CWQ上在8B参数以下模型中取得最优结果，显著提升了小型LLMs的推理能力。

Conclusion: RPO-RAG框架有效提升了小型LLMs在知识图谱问答中的性能，突出了其在资源高效和设备端应用方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet hallucinate on knowledge-intensive tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.

Conclusion: DiaDem模型在生成精确对话描述的视听字幕方面表现优异，同时保持整体性能的竞争力，证明了其有效性。DiaDemBench基准为系统评估对话描述能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurate dialogue description in audiovisual video captioning is crucial for downstream understanding and generation tasks. However, existing models generally struggle to produce faithful dialogue descriptions within audiovisual captions. To mitigate this limitation, we propose DiaDem, a powerful audiovisual video captioning model capable of generating captions with more precise dialogue descriptions while maintaining strong overall performance. We first synthesize a high-quality dataset for SFT, then employ a difficulty-partitioned two-stage GRPO strategy to further enhance dialogue descriptions. To enable systematic evaluation of dialogue description capabilities, we introduce DiaDemBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate models across diverse dialogue scenarios, emphasizing both speaker attribution accuracy and utterance transcription fidelity in audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments on DiaDemBench reveal even commercial models still exhibit substantial room for improvement in dialogue-aware captioning. Notably, DiaDem not only outperforms the Gemini series in dialogue description accuracy but also achieves competitive performance on general audiovisual captioning benchmarks, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Riddles are concise linguistic puzzles that describe an object or idea through indirect, figurative, or playful clues. They are a longstanding form of creative expression, requiring the solver to interpret hints, recognize patterns, and draw inferences to identify the answers. In this work, we introduce a simple pipeline for creating and evaluating analogy-based riddles. The system includes a triples creator that builds structured facts about a concept, a semantic mapper that selects attributes useful for analogy, a stylized generator that turns them into riddle clues, and a validator that collects all possible answers the riddle could point to. We use this validator to study whether large language models can recover the full answer set for different riddle types. Our case study shows that while models often guess the main intended answer, they frequently miss other valid interpretations. This highlights the value of riddles as a lightweight tool for examining reasoning coverage and ambiguity handling in language models.

TL;DR: DART通过并行生成减少推测解码的草稿阶段延迟，在单次前向传播中预测多个未来位置的logits，避免了自回归展开，并结合N-gram语义连续性的树剪枝算法构建高质量草稿树，实现显著加速。

Conclusion: DART通过并行生成和树剪枝算法，有效解决了推测解码中草稿阶段的延迟瓶颈，提供了实用的加速框架，并在多个数据集上证明了其优越性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless approach for accelerating LLM inference. However, existing widely adopted model-based draft designs, such as EAGLE3, improve accuracy at the cost of multi-step autoregressive inference, resulting in high drafting latency and ultimately rendering the drafting stage itself a performance bottleneck. Inspired by diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), we propose DART, which leverages parallel generation to reduce drafting latency. DART predicts logits for multiple future masked positions in parallel within a single forward pass based on hidden states of the target model, thereby eliminating autoregressive rollouts in the draft model while preserving a lightweight design. Based on these parallel logit predictions, we further introduce an efficient tree pruning algorithm that constructs high-quality draft token trees with N-gram-enforced semantic continuity. DART substantially reduces draft-stage overhead while preserving high draft accuracy, leading to significantly improved end-to-end decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that DART achieves a 2.03x--3.44x wall-clock time speedup across multiple datasets, surpassing EAGLE3 by 30% on average and offering a practical speculative decoding framework.

TL;DR: ReToP是一个基于LLM的端到端训练框架，通过EHR重写器与临床预测器的协同训练，提升临床预测任务的性能


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有基于LLM的EHR处理方法在临床预测任务中存在的问题：大多数方法本质上与任务无关，只将LLMs用作EHR编码器或补全模块，未能充分整合预测任务的信号，从而限制了任务性能的准确性

Method: 提出ReToP框架，包含EHR重写器和临床预测器的端到端训练。通过临床驱动的特征选择策略生成合成伪标签，创建多样化的患者重写数据来微调重写器。使用新颖的Classifier Supervised Contribution（CSC）分数将重写器与预测目标对齐，使其生成能直接增强预测的临床相关重写

Result: ReToP在MIMIC-IV的三个临床任务上超越了强基线模型。分析表明ReToP具有良好的泛化能力：只需要最小化的微调就能适应未见的数据集和任务，同时保持忠实重写并强调任务相关的预测特征

Conclusion: ReToP通过将EHR重写与临床预测目标端到端对齐，显著提升了基于LLM的临床预测性能，并展示了出色的可泛化性

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide crucial information for clinical decision-making. However, their high-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity make clinical prediction challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) allowed progress towards addressing this challenge by leveraging parametric medical knowledge to enhance EHR data for clinical prediction tasks. Despite the significant achievements made so far, most of the existing approaches are fundamentally task-agnostic in the sense that they deploy LLMs as EHR encoders or EHR completion modules without fully integrating signals from the prediction tasks. This naturally hinders task performance accuracy. In this work, we propose Rewrite-To-Predict (ReToP), an LLM-based framework that addresses this limitation through an end-to-end training of an EHR rewriter and a clinical predictor. To cope with the lack of EHR rewrite training data, we generate synthetic pseudo-labels using clinical-driven feature selection strategies to create diverse patient rewrites for fine-tuning the EHR rewriter. ReToP aligns the rewriter with prediction objectives using a novel Classifier Supervised Contribution (CSC) score that enables the EHR rewriter to generate clinically relevant rewrites that directly enhance prediction. Our ReToP framework surpasses strong baseline models across three clinical tasks on MIMIC-IV. Moreover, the analysis of ReToP shows its generalizability to unseen datasets and tasks with minimal fine-tuning while preserving faithful rewrites and emphasizing task-relevant predictive features.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed as multi-agent systems, where specialized roles communicate and collaborate through structured interactions to solve complex tasks that often exceed the capacity of a single agent. However, most existing systems still rely on a fixed role library and an execution-frozen interaction topology, a rigid design choice that frequently leads to task mismatch, prevents timely adaptation when new evidence emerges during reasoning, and further inflates inference cost. We introduce MetaGen, a training-free framework that adapts both the role space and the collaboration topology at inference time, without updating base model weights. MetaGen generates and rewrites query-conditioned role specifications to maintain a controllable dynamic role pool, then instantiates a constrained execution graph around a minimal backbone. During execution, it iteratively updates role prompts and adjusts structural decisions using lightweight feedback signals. Experiments on code generation and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that MetaGen improves the accuracy and cost tradeoff over strong multi-agent baselines.

Abstract: Prompting techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Program-of-Thought (PoT) improve LLM mathematical reasoning by structuring intermediate steps in natural language or code. However, applied mathematics problems in domains like finance, physics, and cryptography often require recalling or deriving governing equations, a step that current approaches do not explicitly leverage. We propose Formula-One Prompting (F-1), a two-phase approach that uses mathematical equations as an intermediate representation before adaptive solving. F-1 first formulates governing equations from problem descriptions, then selects a solving strategy among CoT, PoT, or direct computation based on the generated equations, all within a single LLM call. Results across five models and four benchmarks show F-1 outperforms CoT by +5.76% and PoT by +8.42% on average. Crucially, gains are largest in applied domains: +13.30% on FinanceMath over CoT, and within OlympiadBench, larger gains on physics (+2.55%) than pure math (+0.44%). This demonstrates that F-1 is more effective than CoT in applied mathematics problems.

Abstract: Benchmark-based evaluation is the de facto standard for comparing large language models (LLMs). However, its reliability is increasingly threatened by test set contamination, where test samples or their close variants leak into training data and artificially inflate reported performance. To address this issue, prior work has explored two main lines of mitigation. One line attempts to identify and remove contaminated benchmark items before evaluation, but this inevitably alters the evaluation set itself and becomes unreliable when contamination is moderate or severe. The other line preserves the benchmark and instead suppresses contaminated behavior at evaluation time; however, such interventions often interfere with normal inference and lead to noticeable performance degradation on clean inputs. We propose DeconIEP, a decontamination framework that operates entirely during evaluation by applying small, bounded perturbations in the input embedding space. Guided by a relatively less-contaminated reference model, DeconIEP learns an instance-adaptive perturbation generator that steers the evaluated model away from memorization-driven shortcut pathways. Across multiple open-weight LLMs and benchmarks, extensive empirical results show that DeconIEP achieves strong decontamination effectiveness while incurring only minimal degradation in benign utility.

Motivation: 传统指标如BLEU和BERTScore在生成式文本到文本任务中无法有效捕捉语义保真度，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 将源文本和候选文本视为独立知识库，从中生成可验证问题并进行交叉审问，得出覆盖率、一致性、持续性三个可解释分数，并通过系统鲁棒性分析选择稳定的评判模型。

Result: 在翻译、摘要和临床笔记生成任务中验证，CEF能识别标准指标遗漏的严重错误，如内容遗漏和事实矛盾。参考无关模式与参考模式强相关，且其不匹配问题与语义错误高相关，特别擅长识别基于实体和关系扭曲的错误。

Conclusion: CEF提供了一个可靠、可解释的参考无关评估框架，能有效识别生成文本中的语义错误，尤其在实体和关系扭曲方面表现出色。

Abstract: Traditional metrics like BLEU and BERTScore fail to capture semantic fidelity in generative text-to-text tasks. We adapt the Cross-Examination Framework (CEF) for a reference-free, multi-dimensional evaluation by treating the source and candidate as independent knowledge bases. CEF generates verifiable questions from each text and performs a cross-examination to derive three interpretable scores: Coverage, Conformity, and Consistency. Validated across translation, summarization and clinical note-generation, our framework identifies critical errors, such as content omissions and factual contradictions, missed by standard metrics. A key contribution is a systematic robustness analysis to select a stable judge model. Crucially, the strong correlation between our reference-free and with-reference modes validates CEF's reliability without gold references. Furthermore, human expert validation demonstrates that CEF mismatching questions align with meaning-altering semantic errors higher than with non-semantic errors, particularly excelling at identifying entity-based and relational distortions.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive approach for multiword expression (MWE) identification that combines binary token-level classification, linguistic feature integration, and data augmentation. Our DeBERTa-v3-large model achieves 69.8% F1 on the CoAM dataset, surpassing the best results (Qwen-72B, 57.8% F1) on this dataset by 12 points while using 165x fewer parameters. We achieve this performance by (1) reformulating detection as binary token-level START/END/INSIDE classification rather than span-based prediction, (2) incorporating NP chunking and dependency features that help discontinuous and NOUN-type MWEs identification, and (3) applying oversampling that addresses severe class imbalance in the training data. We confirm the generalization of our method on the STREUSLE dataset, achieving 78.9% F1. These results demonstrate that carefully designed smaller models can substantially outperform LLMs on structured NLP tasks, with important implications for resource-constrained deployments.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在翻译方面表现强劲，但其在文档级自动译后编辑(APE)中的效果尚不明确，需要系统性的评估

Method: 通过简单的文档级提示设置，系统比较专有和开源大语言模型在APE质量、上下文行为、鲁棒性和效率等方面的表现

Result: 专有LLM即使使用简单的一次提示也能达到接近人类水平的APE质量，但对数据投毒攻击更具鲁棒性；然而这些模型未能有效利用文档级上下文进行错误修正；标准自动指标不能可靠反映质量改进

Conclusion: LLM在文档感知APE方面既有前景也有局限，专有模型成本高昂不实用，需要更高效的长上下文建模方法用于翻译精炼

Abstract: Automatic post-editing (APE) aims to refine machine translations by correcting residual errors. Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.
  Our results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.

KG-CRAFT first constructs a knowledge graph from claims and associated reports, then formulates contextually relevant contrastive questions based on the knowledge graph structure. These questions guide the distillation of evidence-based reports, which are synthesised into a concise summary that is used for veracity assessment by LLMs. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets (LIAR-RAW and RAWFC) demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in predictive performance. Comprehensive analyses validate in detail the effectiveness of our knowledge graph-based contrastive reasoning approach in improving LLMs' fact-checking capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GradPruner：一種在微調早期基於梯度信息剪枝LLM層的方法，旨在同時提升訓練和推理效率，能在參數減少40%的情況下僅降低0.99%準確率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM下游任務微調通常耗時費力，現有結構化剪枝方法雖能提升推理效率，但需要額外的訓練時間、記憶體、知識蒸餾或結構搜索等策略，難以實現高效的模型微調。

Method: 1. 在微調初期階段計算參數的累積梯度，構建初始梯度信息累積矩陣來評估層的重要性並執行剪枝。2. 根據IGIA-Matrix稀疏化被剪枝的層，並將其與剩餘層合併。3. 僅合併符號相同的元素以減少符號變化帶來的干擾。

Result: 在兩個LLM和八個下游數據集上進行廣泛實驗，包括醫療、金融和通用基準任務。結果顯示GradPruner實現了40%的參數減少，而準確率僅下降0.99%。

Conclusion: GradPruner能夠在微調早期基於梯度信息有效剪枝LLM層，同時顯著提升訓練和推理效率，在保持高準確率的前提下大幅減少模型參數。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with downstream data is often considered time-consuming and expensive. Structured pruning methods are primarily employed to improve the inference efficiency of pre-trained models. Meanwhile, they often require additional time and memory for training, knowledge distillation, structure search, and other strategies, making efficient model fine-tuning challenging to achieve. To simultaneously enhance the training and inference efficiency of downstream task fine-tuning, we introduce GradPruner, which can prune layers of LLMs guided by gradients in the early stages of fine-tuning. GradPruner uses the cumulative gradients of each parameter during the initial phase of fine-tuning to compute the Initial Gradient Information Accumulation Matrix (IGIA-Matrix) to assess the importance of layers and perform pruning. We sparsify the pruned layers based on the IGIA-Matrix and merge them with the remaining layers. Only elements with the same sign are merged to reduce interference from sign variations. We conducted extensive experiments on two LLMs across eight downstream datasets. Including medical, financial, and general benchmark tasks. The results demonstrate that GradPruner has achieved a parameter reduction of 40% with only a 0.99% decrease in accuracy. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in cross-modal tasks but face significant safety challenges, which undermine their reliability in real-world applications. Efforts have been made to build LVLM safety evaluation benchmarks to uncover their vulnerability. However, existing benchmarks are hindered by their labor-intensive construction process, static complexity, and limited discriminative power. Thus, they may fail to keep pace with rapidly evolving models and emerging risks. To address these limitations, we propose VLSafetyBencher, the first automated system for LVLM safety benchmarking. VLSafetyBencher introduces four collaborative agents: Data Preprocessing, Generation, Augmentation, and Selection agents to construct and select high-quality samples. Experiments validates that VLSafetyBencher can construct high-quality safety benchmarks within one week at a minimal cost. The generated benchmark effectively distinguish safety, with a safety rate disparity of 70% between the most and least safe models.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that integrating large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) in neuro-symbolic pipelines helps with entailment verification and proof-guided refinement of explanations for natural language inference (NLI). However, scaling such refinement to naturalistic NLI remains difficult: long, syntactically rich inputs and deep multi-step arguments amplify autoformalisation errors, where a single local mismatch can invalidate the proof. Moreover, current methods often handle failures via costly global regeneration due to the difficulty of localising the responsible span or step from prover diagnostics. Aiming to address these problems, we propose a decompose-and-formalise framework that (i) decomposes premise-hypothesis pairs into an entailment tree of atomic steps, (ii) verifies the tree bottom-up to isolate failures to specific nodes, and (iii) performs local diagnostic-guided refinement instead of regenerating the whole explanation. Moreover, to improve faithfulness of autoformalisation, we introduce $θ$-substitution in an event-based logical form to enforce consistent argument-role bindings. Across a range of reasoning tasks using five LLM backbones, our method achieves the highest explanation verification rates, improving over the state-of-the-art by 26.2%, 21.7%, 21.6% and 48.9%, while reducing refinement iterations and runtime and preserving strong NLI accuracy.

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) from visually-rich documents (VrDs) is a critical task, for which recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong potential. However, their reliance on autoregressive inference, which generates outputs sequentially, creates a significant efficiency bottleneck, especially as KIE tasks often involve extracting multiple, semantically independent fields. To overcome this limitation, we introduce PIP: a Parallel Inference Paradigm for KIE. Our approach reformulates the problem by using "[mask]" tokens as placeholders for all target values, enabling their simultaneous generation in a single forward pass. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a tailored mask pre-training strategy and construct large-scale supervised datasets. Experimental results show that our PIP-models achieve a 5-36x inference speedup with negligible performance degradation compared to traditional autoregressive base models. By substantially improving efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, PIP paves the way for scalable and practical real-world KIE solutions.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型中存在移动sink现象，这些sink token在Transformer的值空间中具有低范数表示，虽然作为避免过度信息混合的保护机制，但它们在不同扩散步骤中的不可预测位置会损害推理的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种简单但有效的额外sink token实现方法，通过修改注意力掩码，创建一个特殊token，它只能关注自身，但所有其他token都可以关注它。

Result: 实验结果表明，引入单个额外token能稳定注意力sink，显著提高模型性能。进一步分析确认该token的效果与其位置无关且语义内容可忽略，验证了其作为稳健的专用结构sink的作用。

Conclusion: 提出的额外sink token方法有效解决了扩散语言模型中的移动sink问题，增强了模型推理的稳定性和性能，且该token的功能特性使其成为可靠的结构化解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a compelling alternative to autoregressive approaches, enabling parallel text generation with competitive performance. Despite these advantages, there is a critical instability in DLMs: the moving sink phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that sink tokens exhibit low-norm representations in the Transformer's value space, and that the moving sink phenomenon serves as a protective mechanism in DLMs to prevent excessive information mixing. However, their unpredictable positions across diffusion steps undermine inference robustness. To resolve this, we propose a simple but effective extra sink token implemented via a modified attention mask. Specifically, we introduce a special token constrained to attend solely to itself, while remaining globally visible to all other tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that introducing a single extra token stabilizes attention sinks, substantially improving model performance. Crucially, further analysis confirms that the effectiveness of this token is independent of its position and characterized by negligible semantic content, validating its role as a robust and dedicated structural sink.

Abstract: We present SynCABEL (Synthetic Contextualized Augmentation for Biomedical Entity Linking), a framework that addresses a central bottleneck in supervised biomedical entity linking (BEL): the scarcity of expert-annotated training data. SynCABEL leverages large language models to generate context-rich synthetic training examples for all candidate concepts in a target knowledge base, providing broad supervision without manual annotation. We demonstrate that SynCABEL, when combined with decoder-only models and guided inference establish new state-of-the-art results across three widely used multilingual benchmarks: MedMentions for English, QUAERO for French, and SPACCC for Spanish. Evaluating data efficiency, we show that SynCABEL reaches the performance of full human supervision using up to 60% less annotated data, substantially reducing reliance on labor-intensive and costly expert labeling. Finally, acknowledging that standard evaluation based on exact code matching often underestimates clinically valid predictions due to ontology redundancy, we introduce an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. This analysis reveals that SynCABEL significantly improves the rate of clinically valid predictions. Our synthetic datasets, models, and code are released to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit human-like linguistic behaviors and internal representations that they could serve as computational simulators of language cognition. We ask whether LLMs can be systematically manipulated to reproduce language-production impairments characteristic of aphasia following focal brain lesions. Such models could provide scalable proxies for testing rehabilitation hypotheses, and offer a controlled framework for probing the functional organization of language. We introduce a clinically grounded, component-level framework that simulates aphasia by selectively perturbing functional components in LLMs, and apply it to both modular Mixture-of-Experts models and dense Transformers using a unified intervention interface. Our pipeline (i) identifies subtype-linked components for Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, (ii) interprets these components with linguistic probing tasks, and (iii) induces graded impairments by progressively perturbing the top-k subtype-linked components, evaluating outcomes with Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) subtests summarized by Aphasia Quotient (AQ). Across architectures and lesioning strategies, subtype-targeted perturbations yield more systematic, aphasia-like regressions than size-matched random perturbations, and MoE modularity supports more localized and interpretable phenotype-to-component mappings. These findings suggest that modular LLMs, combined with clinically informed component perturbations, provide a promising platform for simulating aphasic language production and studying how distinct language functions degrade under targeted disruptions.

Conclusion: TokenSeek是一种高效的令牌效率优化方法，其可解释的令牌寻求过程揭示了其有效性背后的原因，为未来的令牌效率研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Fine tuning has been regarded as a de facto approach for adapting large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, but the high training memory consumption inherited from LLMs makes this process inefficient. Among existing memory efficient approaches, activation-related optimization has proven particularly effective, as activations consistently dominate overall memory consumption. Although prior arts offer various activation optimization strategies, their data-agnostic nature ultimately results in ineffective and unstable fine tuning. In this paper, we propose TokenSeek, a universal plugin solution for various transformer-based models through instance-aware token seeking and ditching, achieving significant fine-tuning memory savings (e.g., requiring only 14.8% of the memory on Llama3.2 1B) with on-par or even better performance. Furthermore, our interpretable token seeking process reveals the underlying reasons for its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for future research on token efficiency.

Abstract: Interactive medical consultation requires an agent to proactively elicit missing clinical evidence under uncertainty. Yet existing evaluations largely remain static or outcome-centric, neglecting the evidence-gathering process. In this work, we propose an interactive evaluation framework that explicitly models the consultation process using a simulated patient and a \rev{simulated reporter} grounded in atomic evidences. Based on this representation, we introduce Information Coverage Rate (ICR) to quantify how completely an agent uncovers necessary evidence during interaction. To support systematic study, we build EviMed, an evidence-based benchmark spanning diverse conditions from common complaints to rare diseases, and evaluate 10 models with varying reasoning abilities. We find that strong diagnostic reasoning does not guarantee effective information collection, and this insufficiency acts as a primary bottleneck limiting performance in interactive settings. To address this, we propose REFINE, a strategy that leverages diagnostic verification to guide the agent in proactively resolving uncertainties. Extensive experiments demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms baselines across diverse datasets and facilitates effective model collaboration, enabling smaller agents to achieve superior performance under strong reasoning supervision.

Abstract: Current stance detection research typically relies on predicting stance based on given targets and text. However, in real-world social media scenarios, targets are neither predefined nor static but rather complex and dynamic. To address this challenge, we propose a novel task: zero-shot stance detection in the wild with Dynamic Target Generation and Multi-Target Adaptation (DGTA), which aims to automatically identify multiple target-stance pairs from text without prior target knowledge. We construct a Chinese social media stance detection dataset and design multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. We explore both integrated and two-stage fine-tuning strategies for large language models (LLMs) and evaluate various baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve superior performance on this task: the two-stage fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B attains the highest comprehensive target recognition score of 66.99%, while the integrated fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a stance detection F1 score of 79.26%.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) extends large language models (LLMs) beyond parametric knowledge, yet it is unclear when iterative retrieval-reasoning loops meaningfully outperform static RAG, particularly in scientific domains with multi-hop reasoning, sparse domain knowledge, and heterogeneous evidence. We provide the first controlled, mechanism-level diagnostic study of whether synchronized iterative retrieval and reasoning can surpass an idealized static upper bound (Gold Context) RAG. We benchmark eleven state-of-the-art LLMs under three regimes: (i) No Context, measuring reliance on parametric memory; (ii) Gold Context, where all oracle evidence is supplied at once; and (iii) Iterative RAG, a training-free controller that alternates retrieval, hypothesis refinement, and evidence-aware stopping. Using the chemistry-focused ChemKGMultiHopQA dataset, we isolate questions requiring genuine retrieval and analyze behavior with diagnostics spanning retrieval coverage gaps, anchor-carry drop, query quality, composition fidelity, and control calibration. Across models, Iterative RAG consistently outperforms Gold Context, with gains up to 25.6 percentage points, especially for non-reasoning fine-tuned models. Staged retrieval reduces late-hop failures, mitigates context overload, and enables dynamic correction of early hypothesis drift, but remaining failure modes include incomplete hop coverage, distractor latch trajectories, early stopping miscalibration, and high composition failure rates even with perfect retrieval. Overall, staged retrieval is often more influential than the mere presence of ideal evidence; we provide practical guidance for deploying and diagnosing RAG systems in specialized scientific settings and a foundation for more reliable, controllable iterative retrieval-reasoning frameworks.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在复杂任务上需要后期训练或计算密集型采样策略来保证可靠性能，限制了实际应用效率。研究发现模型中的一小部分神经元与推理正确性有强相关性，基于此开发轻量级解决方案。

Method: AdaRAS（自适应推理激活引导）框架：首先通过极性感知的均值差异准则识别推理关键神经元（RCNs），然后在推理过程中自适应引导这些神经元的激活，增强错误推理轨迹的同时避免对已正确情况造成性能下降。

Result: 在10个数学和编程基准测试上均显示出持续改进，其中AIME-24和AIME-25提升超过13%。此外，AdaRAS表现出良好的跨数据集可迁移性和对更强模型的可扩展性，优于需要额外训练的后处理方法。

Conclusion: AdaRAS为提升大语言模型推理可靠性提供了一个轻量级、高效的测试时框架，无需额外训练或采样开销即可显著提升模型在数学和编程任务上的表现，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), achieving reliable performance on challenging tasks often requires post-training or computationally expensive sampling strategies, limiting their practical efficiency. In this work, we first show that a small subset of neurons in LLMs exhibits strong predictive correlations with reasoning correctness. Based on this observation, we propose AdaRAS (Adaptive Reasoning Activation Steering), a lightweight test-time framework that improves reasoning reliability by selectively intervening on neuron activations. AdaRAS identifies Reasoning-Critical Neurons (RCNs) via a polarity-aware mean-difference criterion and adaptively steers their activations during inference, enhancing incorrect reasoning traces while avoiding degradation on already-correct cases. Experiments on 10 mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements, including over 13% gains on AIME-24 and AIME-25. Moreover, AdaRAS exhibits strong transferability across datasets and scalability to stronger models, outperforming post-training methods without additional training or sampling cost.

Conclusion: 研究证明结构化自我反思是提升低资源场景翻译质量的一种实用而有效的机制，为未来监督学习或分析驱动的工作提供了支持。

Abstract: Low-resource languages such as isiZulu and isiXhosa face persistent challenges in machine translation due to limited parallel data and linguistic resources. Recent advances in large language models suggest that self-reflection, prompting a model to critique and revise its own outputs, can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on this idea, this paper introduces Reflective Translation, a prompt-based framework in which a model generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique, and then uses this reflection to generate a refined translation. The approach is evaluated on English-isiZulu and English-isiXhosa translation using OPUS-100 and NTREX-African, across multiple prompting strategies and confidence thresholds. Results show consistent improvements in both BLEU and COMET scores between first- and second-pass translations, with average gains of up to +0.22 BLEU and +0.18 COMET. Statistical significance testing using paired nonparametric tests confirms that these improvements are robust. The proposed method is model-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and introduces a reflection-augmented dataset that can support future supervised or analysis-driven work. These findings demonstrate that structured self-reflection is a practical and effective mechanism for improving translation quality in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Multidisciplinary tumour boards (MDTBs) play a central role in oncology decision-making but require manual processes and structuring large volumes of heterogeneous clinical information, resulting in a substantial documentation burden. In this work, we present ONCOTIMIA, a modular and secure clinical tool designed to integrate generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into oncology workflows and evaluate its application to the automatic completion of lung cancer tumour board forms using large language models (LLMs). The system combines a multi-layer data lake, hybrid relational and vector storage, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a rule-driven adaptive form model to transform unstructured clinical documentation into structured and standardised tumour board records. We assess the performance of six LLMs deployed through AWS Bedrock on ten lung cancer cases, measuring both completion form accuracy and end-to-end latency. The results demonstrate high performance across models, with the best performing configuration achieving an 80% of correct field completion and clinically acceptable response time for most LLMs. Larger and more recent models exhibit best accuracies without incurring prohibitive latency. These findings provide empirical evidence that LLM- assisted autocompletion form is technically feasible and operationally viable in multidisciplinary lung cancer workflows and support its potential to significantly reduce documentation burden while preserving data quality.

Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics. This vision charts a research agenda toward sustainable peer review.

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

*Andrew Jaffe,Noah Reicin,Jinho D. Choi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RIFT基准测试揭示了LLMs在指令跟随上对序列位置的强烈依赖，跳跃结构导致准确率显著下降，凸显当前架构的结构敏感性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试将任务复杂性与结构顺序混为一谈，难以分离提示拓扑对性能的影响。需要评估指令跟随能力，区分结构从内容影响

Method: 引入RIFT（重排序指令跟随测试平台），使用改述的Jeopardy!问答对测试LLMs在线性提示（顺序）和跳跃提示（非顺序遍历但内容相同）两种结构下的表现

Result: 在10000次评估中的六种领先开源LLMs，跳跃条件下的准确率相比基线下降高达72%；约50%的失败源于指令顺序违反和语义漂移

Conclusion: 结果揭示了结构敏感性是当前架构的基本局限，对需要非顺序控制流的应用（如工作流自动化和多智能体系统）具有直接影响，表明当前架构将指令跟随内化为顺序模式而非推理技能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D情感说话人脸合成方法存在两大问题：音视频情感对齐差（难以提取音频情感、情感微表情控制不足）；采用一刀切的多视角融合策略忽略不确定性和特征质量差异，影响渲染质量。

Method: 提出UA-3DTalk框架，包含：1）先验提取模块解耦音频为内容同步特征（对齐）和个性化补充特征；2）情感蒸馏模块使用多模态注意力加权融合和4D高斯编码，实现细粒度音频情感提取和微表情控制；3）不确定性形变模块通过不确定性块估计视角特异的不确定性，实现自适应多视角融合，使用多头解码器优化高斯基元。

Result: 在常规和情感数据集上的实验表明，UA-3DTalk在E-FID情感对齐指标上比DEGSTalk和EDTalk提升5.2%，SyncC唇同步提升3.1%，LPIPS渲染质量提升0.015。

Conclusion: UA-3DTalk通过情感先验蒸馏和不确定性感知的多视角融合，显著提升了3D情感说话人脸合成的情感对齐、唇同步和渲染质量。

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗性数据增强方法通过强化学习框架，有效增强了函数调用大语言模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为模型弱点识别和修正提供了系统化方案。

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

Abstract: User behavior sequences in modern recommendation systems exhibit significant length heterogeneity, ranging from sparse short-term interactions to rich long-term histories. While longer sequences provide more context, we observe that increasing the maximum input sequence length in existing CTR models paradoxically degrades performance for short-sequence users due to attention polarization and length imbalance in training data. To address this, we propose LAIN(Length-Adaptive Interest Network), a plug-and-play framework that explicitly incorporates sequence length as a conditioning signal to balance long- and short-sequence modeling. LAIN consists of three lightweight components: a Spectral Length Encoder that maps length into continuous representations, Length-Conditioned Prompting that injects global contextual cues into both long- and short-term behavior branches, and Length-Modulated Attention that adaptively adjusts attention sharpness based on sequence length. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks across five strong CTR backbones show that LAIN consistently improves overall performance, achieving up to 1.15% AUC gain and 2.25% log loss reduction. Notably, our method significantly improves accuracy for short-sequence users without sacrificing longsequence effectiveness. Our work offers a general, efficient, and deployable solution to mitigate length-induced bias in sequential recommendation.

Motivation: 现有方法通过监督训练或基于轨迹的强化微调将位置知识和推理模式内化到静态内存中，容易出现事实幻觉和泛化瓶颈。本文旨在解决开放世界或需要动态知识的场景中的这些问题。

Method: 设计分层推理智能体LocationAgent，采用RER架构进行角色分离和上下文压缩，构建线索探索工具集提供多样化证据支持，并创建中文图像地理定位基准CCL-Bench。

Result: LocationAgent在零样本设置下比现有方法至少高出30%的性能，表现出优越的地理定位能力。

Conclusion: 通过将推理逻辑保留在模型内部而将证据验证委托给外部工具，LocationAgent成功解决了图像地理定位中的事实幻觉和泛化问题，为开放世界场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

Motivation: 现有多模态表格理解数据集（如MMTab）主要提供简短的事实性答案，缺乏显式的多步推理监督，导致模型生成答案准确性不足、可解释性有限。

Method: 提出CoReTab代码驱动推理框架，将多步推理与可执行的Python代码耦合，生成可扩展、可解释、可自动验证的标注；使用该框架构建包含11.5万个样本的数据集（平均每个响应529个标记），并通过三阶段流水线微调开源MLLMs。

Result: 在17个MMTab基准测试（表格问答、事实验证、表格结构理解）上，相比基于MMTab训练的基线模型分别实现了+6.2%、+5.7%和+25.6%的显著提升，同时产生了透明且可验证的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: CoReTab作为一个稳健且可推广的监督框架，能够有效提升多模态表格理解中的多步推理能力。

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Method: 提出GLOVE框架，通过主动探测检索记忆与新鲜观察之间的不一致性，建立相对真理概念，实现无监督记忆验证和更新

Conclusion: GLOVE为实现能够自我进化的认知智能体提供了一条稳健的路径，通过相对真理概念解决了动态环境中的记忆对齐问题

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Abstract: Modern AI systems increasingly comprise multiple interconnected neural networks to tackle complex inference tasks. Testing such systems for robustness and safety entails significant challenges. Current state-of-the-art robustness testing techniques, whether black-box or white-box, have been proposed and implemented for single-network models and do not scale well to multi-network pipelines. We propose a modular robustness testing framework that applies a given set of perturbations to test data. Our testing framework supports (1) a component-wise system analysis to isolate errors and (2) reasoning about error propagation across the neural network modules. The testing framework is architecture and modality agnostic and can be applied across domains. We apply the framework to a real-world autonomous rail inspection system composed of multiple deep networks and successfully demonstrate how our approach enables fine-grained robustness analysis beyond conventional end-to-end metrics.

Conclusion: RPO是一个即插即用的强化微调算法，能有效降低训练计算开销，并兼容现有强化微调算法实现性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms.

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型基准测试存在数据集不准确和评估方法缺陷的问题，这些噪声会影响模型性能评估的精确性，需要更干净的数据集和更可靠的评价标准。

Method: 对Omni-MATH数据集进行人工修订：创建干净标准答案子集（n=4181）和标记非标准子集（n=247）；保证LaTeX可编译性、可解性和可验证性；添加缺失图表信息，标记证明、估算或图像需求问题；比较GPT-5 mini与原始Omni-Judge评估差异。

Result: 修订过程显著减少数据噪声，专家标注显示Omni-Judge在96.4%的评估分歧中错误；随着问题难度增加，需要更胜任的评价标准来防止评估错误掩盖模型真实差异；标记问题子集中两种评价标准均未识别当前失效模式。

Conclusion: 数据集质量和评价标准可靠性对大语言模型性能基准测试都至关重要；只有同时改善这两个方面，才能准确评估模型能力差异，开发出有效的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Conclusion: 规则化的激活安全方法为LLM安全监测提供了更精确、灵活、可解释的解决方案，推动了AI治理的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

Abstract: Graph-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enable complex cyclic workflows but suffer from inefficient static model allocation, where deploying strong models uniformly wastes computation on trivial sub-tasks. We propose CASTER (Context-Aware Strategy for Task Efficient Routing), a lightweight router for dynamic model selection in graph-based MAS. CASTER employs a Dual-Signal Router that combines semantic embeddings with structural meta-features to estimate task difficulty. During training, the router self-optimizes through a Cold Start to Iterative Evolution paradigm, learning from its own routing failures via on-policy negative feedback. Experiments using LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation across Software Engineering, Data Analysis, Scientific Discovery, and Cybersecurity demonstrate that CASTER reduces inference cost by up to 72.4% compared to strong-model baselines while matching their success rates, and consistently outperforms both heuristic routing and FrugalGPT across all domains.

Abstract: We address the task of routing natural language queries in multi-database enterprise environments. We construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets. Our study shows that routing becomes increasingly challenging with larger, domain-overlapping DB repositories and ambiguous queries, motivating the need for more structured and robust reasoning-based solutions. By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

TL;DR: NavFormer利用旋转不变的标量特征和Canonical SPD模块来稳定三元磁力仪数据的频谱，实现在IMU姿态变化时对恒定地磁场总强度的鲁棒预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在导航应用中，三元磁力仪的测量值会随着传感器姿态变化而变化，而地磁场总强度（IGRF）在短时间内是恒定不变的。现有方法难以直接从变化的矢量测量中鲁棒地提取这个不变量，这限制了磁力计在自主导航中的可靠应用。

Method: 1) 使用旋转不变的标量特征作为输入；2) 提出Canonical SPD模块：通过对每个时间窗口的Gram矩阵建立规范坐标系，并在原始坐标中应用状态依赖的频谱缩放，避免了符号不连续性，稳定了三元磁力仪窗口数据二阶矩的频谱。

Result: 在五个飞行实验数据集上的测试表明，模型在标准训练、少样本训练和零样本迁移任务中，均比现有的强基线方法取得了更低的预测误差。代码已公开。

Conclusion: NavFormer通过旋转不变的标量特征结合Canonical SPD模块，能够鲁棒地预测恒定地磁场总强度，在姿态变化的实际导航场景中表现出优越性能，为自主导航系统提供了更可靠的磁力计数据利用方案。

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

Motivation: 高维数据集中距离度量有效性降低，降维投影易导致簇重叠，传统静态嵌入无法利用分析者直觉，需交互式增强聚类可解释性与质量。

Method: 整合非线性投影模块与反馈循环：用户可通过调整视角、添加must-link/cannot-link约束来重塑投影目标函数；优化后的二维布局配合传统聚类算法识别簇；解释性组件将簇映射回原特征空间生成可解释规则。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证，少量交互优化步骤即可显著提升聚类质量，使投影结构更清晰、簇分离度更高。

Conclusion: IPBC将聚类转化为协作发现过程，实现了机器表征与人类洞察的相互增强，为高维数据探索提供了可解释、可干预的分析框架。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

Conclusion: TGR提供了一种高效且实用的训练免费框架，能够在有限计算资源下显著提升长链思维推理的轨迹覆盖质量，为大规模语言模型推理优化提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Abstract: Recent Transformer- and MLP-based models have demonstrated strong performance in long-term time series forecasting, yet Transformers remain limited by their quadratic complexity and permutation-equivariant attention, while MLPs exhibit spectral bias. We propose HaKAN, a versatile model based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), leveraging Hahn polynomial-based learnable activation functions and providing a lightweight and interpretable alternative for multivariate time series forecasting. Our model integrates channel independence, patching, a stack of Hahn-KAN blocks with residual connections, and a bottleneck structure comprised of two fully connected layers. The Hahn-KAN block consists of inter- and intra-patch KAN layers to effectively capture both global and local temporal patterns. Extensive experiments on various forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its core components.

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation transfers behavior from a teacher to a student model, but the process is inherently stochastic: teacher outputs, student training, and student inference can all be random. Collapsing these uncertainties to a single point estimate can distort what is learned. We systematically study how uncertainty propagates through knowledge distillation across three representative model classes--linear regression, feed-forward neural networks, and large language models (LLMs)--and propose simple corrections. We distinguish inter-student uncertainty (variance across independently distilled students) from intra-student uncertainty (variance of a single student's predictive distribution), showing that standard single-response knowledge distillation suppresses intra-student variance while leaving substantial inter-student variability. To address these mismatches, we introduce two variance-aware strategies: averaging multiple teacher responses, which reduces noise at rate $O(1/k)$, and variance-weighting, which combines teacher and student estimates via inverse-variance weighting to yield a minimum-variance estimator. We provide formal guarantees in linear regression, validate the methods in neural networks, and demonstrate empirical gains in LLM distillation, including reduced systematic noise and hallucination. These results reframe knowledge distillation as an uncertainty transformation and show that variance-aware distillation produces more stable students that better reflect teacher uncertainty.

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

Abstract: A wide range of graph learning tasks, such as structure discovery, temporal graph analysis, and combinatorial optimization, focus on inferring graph structures from data, rather than making predictions on given graphs. However, the respective methods to solve such problems are often developed in an isolated, task-specific manner and thus lack a unifying theoretical foundation. Here, we provide a stepping stone towards the formation of such a foundation and further development by introducing the Neural Graph Inverse Problem (GraIP) conceptual framework, which formalizes and reframes a broad class of graph learning tasks as inverse problems. Unlike discriminative approaches that directly predict target variables from given graph inputs, the GraIP paradigm addresses inverse problems, i.e., it relies on observational data and aims to recover the underlying graph structure by reversing the forward process, such as message passing or network dynamics, that produced the observed outputs. We demonstrate the versatility of GraIP across various graph learning tasks, including rewiring, causal discovery, and neural relational inference. We also propose benchmark datasets and metrics for each GraIP domain considered, and characterize and empirically evaluate existing baseline methods used to solve them. Overall, our unifying perspective bridges seemingly disparate applications and provides a principled approach to structural learning in constrained and combinatorial settings while encouraging cross-pollination of existing methods across graph inverse problems.

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

TL;DR: 提出了FSD-CAP两阶段框架，用于解决图数据中节点特征高缺失率的插补问题。在99.5%特征缺失情况下，该方法在节点分类和链接预测任务中接近完整特征性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据中节点特征高度缺失时，现有方法基于潜在表示或全局扩散常常产生不可靠估计，且可能将误差传播到整个图中，需要更有效的插补方法。

Method: FSD-CAP框架分为两个阶段：1）第一阶段通过图距离引导的子图扩展局部化扩散过程，利用分数扩散算子基于局部结构调整传播锐度；2）第二阶段使用类别感知传播进行细化，结合伪标签和邻域熵以促进一致性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，当99.5%特征缺失时，FSD-CAP在节点分类任务中达到平均80.06%（结构性缺失）和81.01%（均匀缺失）的准确率，接近完整特征GCN的81.31%。在链接预测任务中达到91.65%（结构性缺失）和92.41%（均匀缺失）的AUC分数，相比完整特征的95.06%。该框架在大规模和异质性数据集上也优于其他模型。

Conclusion: FSD-CAP提出了一种有效的两阶段图特征插补框架，能够在极端稀疏条件下恢复高质量特征估计，实现接近完整特征水平的图学习性能，特别适用于高度缺失和异质性图数据场景。

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Motivation: 量子硬件存在设备异质性和环境漂移等问题，现有方法需要在非自适应控制器与昂贵的逐个设备重新校准之间做出选择，缺乏量化决策依据。

Method: 推导元学习的缩放定律下界，分析适应收益（任务特定梯度步的期望保真度改进）随梯度步指数饱和且与任务方差线性缩放；用此模型在量子门校准和经典线性二次控制中进行验证。

Result: 量子门校准实验显示，低方差任务适应收益可忽略，但在极端的分布外条件下（训练噪声的10倍），双量子比特门的保真度提升超过40%；经典控制结果证实该定律源于一般优化几何而非量子特定物理。

Conclusion: 研究建立了可迁移的适应性控制决策框架，为减少量子云处理器的逐设备校准时间提供了量化指导，揭示了适应效益与开销权衡的通用几何原理。

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

Conclusion: 微缩放量化中的输出劣化现象与块大小减小预期相反，其根本原因是张量分布特性与量化尺度动态范围的匹配问题。通过采用FP8 UE5M3格式，可以在保持模型性能的同时实现更高效的硬件部署。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

Motivation: 关键挑战是在使用数据、算法和数据驱动系统时坚持公平正义原则。统计公平度量是检测数据与算法公平问题的重要技术/正式机制。统计奇偶性不依赖真实标签，在实践中更适用且被许多法律和专业框架采用；均等机会需要真实标签，虽不总是可行，但在需要保证敏感社会群体间错误预测公平性的场景中应当满足。

Method: 提出了一种新分析框架，研究统计奇偶性与均等机会之间的关系，特别关注敏感群体基率的作用。该方法通过理论分析直观展示基率不平衡如何导致这两种公平度量标准的不兼容性。

Result: 分析表明，基率不平衡会导致统计奇偶性和均等机会的不兼容。这为在实践中如何在这两种度量标准之间进行设计权衡提供了洞察，并强调在强制执行或依赖统计奇偶性准则之前，需要检查基率平衡状况并调查不兼容的可能性。

Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于用户编辑数据微调大型语言模型的理论框架和方法，统一了偏好、监督标签和成本三种反馈类型的学习，并通过集成学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基于LLM的写作助手和代码编辑器等应用中自然产生的用户编辑数据进行模型微调，实现个性化适应。这种自然来源的数据为LLM优化提供了理想的基础，同时统一了传统上分别研究的多种反馈类型（偏好、监督标签、成本），为理论研究的启动提供了契机。

Method: 首先分析了单独学习每种反馈类型的算法的理论界限，证明了它们在不同用户、数据分布和模型类别下的权衡差异。随后提出了一个简单的集成学习程序，从这些反馈类型中进行联合学习。在两个特定领域的数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。

Result: 在两个基于Gao等人（2024）研究的领域上，集成程序的表现优于仅从单一反馈类型学习的方法。此外，研究还表明，该方法能够鲁棒地适应测试时不同的用户编辑分布变化。

Conclusion: 用户编辑数据为LLM的个性化微调提供了有效的自然反馈源，通过集成学习整合多种反馈类型可以显著提升模型性能，并增强对分布变化的鲁棒性。这项工作为从用户编辑中学习的理论基础和方法论开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

TL;DR: 提出了基于首个信号预测的快速推理方法，通过只使用第一个停止的模型预测来减少计算量，在数独难题上达到97.2%准确率，计算量减少10倍；同时开发了训练时仅通过最低损失的获胜者进行反向传播的方法，单个模型达到96.9%准确率，无需测试时增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经系统必须在速度快但能量受限的条件下工作，演化解决方案是作用于第一个信号。Winner-take-all电路和时间到第一脉冲编码都隐含地将神经元何时放电视为置信度的表达。研究人员希望将这一原理应用于Tiny Recursive Models（TRM）集合中，实现高效推理。

Method: 1. 推理阶段：基于首个停止的模型进行预测，而非平均所有预测；2. 训练阶段：保持K=4个并行潜在状态，但仅通过最低损失的"获胜者"进行反向传播；3. 模型改进：开发了改良版SwiGLU激活函数，使Muon模型可行；通过资源约束下的高效训练实现。

Result: 1. 集合方法：在Sudoku-Extreme上达到97.2%准确率，比测试时增强（TTA）少用10倍计算量（TTA为97.3%）；2. 单个模型：达到96.9% ± 0.6%准确率，无需任何测试时增强；3. 训练效率：K=1训练在7k步（40分钟）内超过TRM基线，更高精度需36k步（K=1：1.5小时，K=4：6小时）。

Conclusion: 证明了推理速度可以作为置信度的隐式指示，并且这种能力可以转化为仅训练时的成本。通过仅使用首个停止模型的预测，实现了高效推理；通过训练时仅反向传播最低损失的获胜者，单个模型即可达到接近测试时增强的性能。所有实验均在单个RTX 5090上进行，体现了资源约束下的创新。

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

Motivation: 当前许多基于私有数据集训练的深度学习模型在部署时存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可能从模型中恢复敏感数据或标签信息。为了解决这一问题，需要一种无需原始数据的隐私保护模型转换方案。

Method: 采用协作-竞争学习框架，通过可训练生成器将预训练模型转换为具有隐私保护的学生模型。该方法包含三个玩家交替优化：生成器生成合成数据，教师和学生模型通过灵活的噪声扰动计算差分隐私标签，学生用噪声标签更新，生成器则将学生作为判别器进行对抗训练。

Result: 该方法在理论上证明了能保证差分隐私和收敛性。转录的学生模型具有良好的性能和隐私保护能力，生成的合成数据可用于下游任务。实验结果表明，该方法在26个基准方法中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该工作提出的隐私保护模型转录方法为安全模型部署提供了有效解决方案，在不依赖原始数据的情况下实现了模型的隐私保护转换，并验证了其理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

Abstract: Developing models capable of complex, multi-step reasoning is a central goal in artificial intelligence. While representing problems as graphs is a powerful approach, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are fundamentally constrained by their message-passing mechanism, which imposes a local bottleneck that limits global, holistic reasoning. We argue that dynamic programming (DP), which solves problems by iteratively refining a global state, offers a more powerful and suitable learning paradigm. We introduce FloydNet, a new architecture that embodies this principle. In contrast to local message passing, FloydNet maintains a global, all-pairs relationship tensor and learns a generalized DP operator to progressively refine it. This enables the model to develop a task-specific relational calculus, providing a principled framework for capturing long-range dependencies. Theoretically, we prove that FloydNet achieves 3-WL (2-FWL) expressive power, and its generalized form aligns with the k-FWL hierarchy. FloydNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across challenging domains: it achieves near-perfect scores (often >99\%) on the CLRS-30 algorithmic benchmark, finds exact optimal solutions for the general Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) at rates significantly exceeding strong heuristics, and empirically matches the 3-WL test on the BREC benchmark. Our results establish this learned, DP-style refinement as a powerful and practical alternative to message passing for high-level graph reasoning.

Motivation: 跨域图谱数据的特征语义和维度差异阻碍了图形基础模型的发展，需要一种能在未见图谱上无需重新训练即可检测异常的通用模型。

Method: 1. 跨域特征对齐模块，在保持领域特定语义的同时协调特征分布；2. 多域多模式字典学习，编码共享的结构和属性模式；3. 基于截断注意力的重建模块，实现上下文学习能力。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，OWLEYE在性能和泛化能力方面优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: OWLEYE为可扩展且标签高效的异常检测奠定了坚实基础，解决了图形异常检测中的跨域泛化难题。

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Abstract: Machine learning systems engineering requires a deep understanding of framework internals. Yet most current education separates algorithms from systems. Students learn gradient descent without measuring memory usage, and attention mechanisms without profiling computational cost. This split leaves graduates unprepared to debug real production failures and widens the gap between machine learning research and reliable deployment. We present TinyTorch, a 20 module curriculum in which students implement the core components of PyTorch, including tensors, autograd, optimizers, and neural networks, entirely in pure Python. The curriculum is built around three pedagogical principles. Progressive disclosure gradually introduces complexity as students build confidence. Systems first integration embeds memory and performance awareness from the very beginning. Historical milestone validation guides students to recreate key breakthroughs, from the Perceptron in 1958 to modern Transformers, using only code they have written themselves. TinyTorch requires only a laptop with 4GB of RAM and no GPU, making machine learning systems education accessible worldwide. Its goal is to prepare the next generation of AI engineers, practitioners who understand not only what machine learning systems do, but why they work and how to make them scale. The curriculum is available as open source at mlsysbook.ai slash tinytorch.

TL;DR: vllm-mlx框架在Apple Silicon上实现了高效的LLM/MLLM推理，相比现有方案在文本模型上吞吐量提升21-87%，多模态模型通过内容哈希缓存实现28倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple Silicon在机器学习开发中的普及需要利用其统一内存架构的高效推理方案。现有工具要么缺乏原生优化（PyTorch MPS），要么仅关注文本模型（llama.cpp），忽视了多模态工作负载的需求。

Method: 基于MLX原生构建的推理框架，对文本模型实现连续批处理，对多模态模型引入基于内容哈希的图像识别缓存机制，避免重复视觉编码。

Result: 在Apple M4 Max上，文本模型吞吐量达525 tokens/秒，多模态模型重复图像查询加速28倍（延迟从21.7秒降至<1秒），视频分析实现24.7倍缓存加速。连续批处理在16并发请求时聚合吞吐量提升4.3倍。

Conclusion: vllm-mlx填补了Apple Silicon上高效多模态推理的空白，通过原生MLX优化和智能缓存机制显著提升性能，并以开源形式发布支持消费者硬件的高效推理。

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Motivation: 符号图中的链接预测任务需要区分关系的正负符号，但由于负边的存在违反了图同质性假设，传统的图方法难以直接应用。需要一种能够直接建模边之间潜在统计依赖关系的方法。

Method: 1) 使用高斯Copula及其相关矩阵直接建模边之间的潜在统计依赖关系；2) 将相关矩阵表示为边缘嵌入的Gramian，大幅减少参数数量；3) 重新表述条件概率分布以显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效的建模和推理策略，解决了符号图链接预测中的计算复杂度问题，实现了既高效又有效的预测性能。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

Conclusion: Foresight Learning方法能够仅使用原始时序领域文本实现特定领域专家模型的规模化自动化训练，达到前沿性能且可在单个GPU上部署。

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Motivation: 现有 Wasserstein 空间中的多目标优化算法 MWGraD 收敛速度为 O(1/t)，存在提升空间。受 Nesterov 加速方法的启发，研究者希望通过引入加速机制来改进收敛性能。

Method: 提出 A-MWGraD 算法，基于 MWGraD 架构融入 Nesterov 加速思想。首先分析连续时间动力学，证明算法收敛到概率空间的弱帕累托最优点。然后提出基于核方法的实际离散化方案，便于数值实现。

Result: 理论分析表明：对于测地凸目标，A-MWGraD 达到 O(1/t²) 收敛率；对于 β-强测地凸目标，达到 O(e^{-√βt}) 指数收敛率。均优于 MWGraD 的 O(1/t) 收敛率。数值实验证实新算法在多目标采样任务中一致优于 MWGraD，在收敛速度和采样效率方面均有优势。

Conclusion: A-MWGraD 成功将加速技术应用于 Wasserstein 空间的多目标优化，显著提升了收敛性能，为概率分布优化提供了更高效的算法框架。

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning is increasingly driven by the refinement of post-training loss functions and alignment strategies. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) remain constrained by static uniformity: uniform prompt sampling and a fixed number of rollouts per prompt. For heterogeneous, heavy-tailed reasoning data, this creates structural inefficiencies that waste compute on already-solved patterns while under-training the long tail of hard problems. To address this, we propose Multi-Adversary Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GDRO), an optimization-first framework that moves beyond uniform reasoning models by dynamically adapting the training distribution.
  We introduce an Online Difficulty Classifier that partitions prompts into dynamic pass@k difficulty groups. We then propose two independent GDRO games for post-training: (1) Prompt-GDRO, which employs an EMA-debiased multiplicative-weights bandit sampler to target the intensive difficulty margin and upweight persistently hard groups without frequency bias; and (2) Rollout-GDRO, which uses a shadow-price controller to reallocate rollouts across groups, maximizing gradient variance reduction on hard tasks under a fixed mean budget (compute-neutral). We provide no-regret guarantees for both controllers and additionally a variance-proxy analysis motivating a square-root optimal rollout allocation for Rollout-GDRO. We validate our framework on the DAPO 14.1k dataset using Qwen3-Base models. Prompt-GDRO and Rollout-GDRO achieve average relative gains of +10.6% and +10.1%, respectively, in pass@8 accuracy across 1.7B, 4B, and 8B scales compared to the GRPO baseline. Qualitative analysis shows an emergent curriculum: the adversaries shift resources to the evolving reasoning frontier, enhancing the reasoning model's performance.

Motivation: 模拟推断中协变量依赖的不确定性量化对于高风险决策至关重要，但现有方法如conformal prediction和经典bootstrap在处理协变量特定条件量化时存在困难，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出的E-QRGMM框架将三次Hermite插值与梯度估计结合，优化了原有的QRGMM方法，减少了网格复杂度。该方法能够在保持原方法收敛速度的同时，提高计算效率，并且支持基于bootstrap构建任意感兴趣估计量的置信区间。

Conclusion: E-QRGMM为协变量依赖的不确定性量化提供了实用解决方案，通过更高效的分位数回归生成元建模框架，在保持理论性质的同时显著改善计算性能，适用于高风险决策支持。

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

TL;DR: 提出一种超越反向传播的分割学习训练方法，用局部损失信号替代梯度传播，将通信成本减半并显著降低内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割学习依赖端到端反向传播，需要每轮迭代交换前向激活和反向梯度，导致巨大的通信开销和内存占用。

Method: 客户端和服务器半独立地训练模型分区：客户端在分割点处添加小型辅助分类器提供局部误差信号，服务器则利用真实损失函数在客户端传输的激活上进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验表明：1) 性能与标准反向传播分割学习相当；2) 通信量减少50%，峰值内存使用降低高达58%。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解耦了客户端和服务器的训练过程，无需传输反向梯度即可保持模型性能，同时大幅降低了通信和内存成本。

Abstract: Split learning is a distributed training paradigm where a neural network is partitioned between clients and a server, which allows data to remain at the client while only intermediate activations are shared. Traditional split learning relies on end-to-end backpropagation across the client-server split point. This incurs a large communication overhead (i.e., forward activations and backward gradients need to be exchanged every iteration) and significant memory use (for storing activations and gradients). In this paper, we develop a beyond-backpropagation training method for split learning. In this approach, the client and server train their model partitions semi-independently, using local loss signals instead of propagated gradients. In particular, the client's network is augmented with a small auxiliary classifier at the split point to provide a local error signal, while the server trains on the client's transmitted activations using the true loss function. This decoupling removes the need to send backward gradients, which cuts communication costs roughly in half and also reduces memory overhead (as each side only stores local activations for its own backward pass). We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Our experiments show two key results. First, the proposed approach achieves performance on par with standard split learning that uses backpropagation. Second, it significantly reduces communication (of transmitting activations/gradient) by 50% and peak memory usage by up to 58%.

Motivation: 现有研究表明Transformer中的多头注意力可以通过头部间交互增强性能，但缺乏显式建模，因此提出MEA来显式优化跨头部交互机制。

Method: 提出MEA（Multi-head Explicit Attention），包含：1）HLC模块，分别对key和value向量跨头部进行可学习的线性组合 2）头部级Group Normalization层。还探索参数效率，通过虚拟头部重建减少注意力头数量并实现KV缓存压缩。

Result: MEA预训练中表现出更强鲁棒性，支持更大学习率并加快收敛，降低验证损失并提升多任务性能。KV缓存压缩策略可将内存使用降低50%，在知识密集和科学推理任务上效果损失可忽略，奥林匹克数学基准上仅下降3.59%。

Conclusion: MEA通过显式建模跨头部交互提供了一种有效且鲁棒的attention改进方案，同时通过虚拟头部重建实现了实用的参数效率优化和KV缓存压缩，在保持性能的同时显著降低内存需求。

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN. These findings indicate that Post-LN, when paired with a Highway-style connection, provides a simple and effective foundation for building deeply scalable LLMs, opening the possibility for future infinite-depth architectures.

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

TL;DR: 本文研究在四元组相对距离模型（Rank-model，R-model）下进行k-聚类的问题，其中无法获取精确的成对距离，只能通过四元组相对比较查询来获取距离的相对比较信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的k-聚类算法（如k-median和k-means）需要精确的成对距离，这在许多实际应用中是不现实的。在许多现代应用中，距离信息通常来自学习模型或人类反馈，具有噪声且访问成本较高

Method: 在R-model中，距离查询被四元组相对距离比较查询所完全替代，该查询只返回点间距离的相对比较关系。对于n个输入点的度量空间，设计了随机化算法，它们仅使用带有噪声的四元组查询来生成O(k·polylog(n))个中心以及从输入点到中心点的映射

Result: 算法实现了常数因子的聚类近似，查询复杂度为O(n·k·polylog(n))。对于有界加倍维度的度量空间，查询复杂度可提高至O((n+k^2)·polylog(n))，且可将近似比从常数改进至1+ε（任意小的常数ε>0），同时保持渐近查询复杂度不变

Conclusion: 本文的研究框架展示了如何将类似于大语言模型那样的、带有噪声的低成本查询（oracle）系统地整合到可扩展的聚类算法中

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了基于双重建差异估计(Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation, DRUE)的新方法，通过在两个中间层重建输入并计算输出差异作为不确定性得分，改善了单重建比较的信息损失和多细节敏感性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医疗影像等高风险应用中需要可靠的不确定性估计。现有基于重构样本与原始输入差异的方法存在信息损失和对表面细节过于敏感的局限性，影响了不确定性估计的有效性。

Method: DRUE方法从一个辅助模型的两个不同中间层重构输入，然后测量这两个重建输出之间的差异，将这个差异作为不确定性得分。相比单一重建方法，这减少了信息损失和细节敏感性。

Result: 在基于开角型青光眼检测的实验中，遵循广泛使用的OOD检测范式，DRUE在多个域偏移数据集上都一致获得了优越的AUC和AUPR表现，证明了其在分布偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不确定环境中增强模型可靠性提供了一个原则性且有效的框架，展示了DRUE方法在解决单重建比较局限性的有效性，并通过实验验证了其在实际OOD检测任务中的优越性能。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty in deep learning models is critical for reliable decision-making in high-stakes applications such as medical imaging. Prior research has established that the difference between an input sample and its reconstructed version produced by an auxiliary model can serve as a useful proxy for uncertainty. However, directly comparing reconstructions with the original input is degraded by information loss and sensitivity to superficial details, which limits its effectiveness. In this work, we propose Difference Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimation (DRUE), a method that mitigates this limitation by reconstructing inputs from two intermediate layers and measuring the discrepancy between their outputs as the uncertainty score. To evaluate uncertainty estimation in practice, we follow the widely used out-of-distribution (OOD) detection paradigm, where in-distribution (ID) training data are compared against datasets with increasing domain shift. Using glaucoma detection as the ID task, we demonstrate that DRUE consistently achieves superior AUC and AUPR across multiple OOD datasets, highlighting its robustness and reliability under distribution shift. This work provides a principled and effective framework for enhancing model reliability in uncertain environments.

### [190] [Selective Steering: Norm-Preserving Control Through Discriminative Layer Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19375)
*Quy-Anh Dang,Chris Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了Selective Steering方法，通过数学上严格的范数保持旋转公式和区分性层选择，解决了现有激活引导技术在对抗攻击中的局限性，实现了更高效稳定的LLM行为调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在对齐方面取得显著进展，大型语言模型仍容易受到引出有害行为的对抗攻击。现有的激活引导技术存在关键局限：激活加法需要仔细调整系数且对层特定范数变化敏感，而方向性消融只能提供二元控制。Angular Steering虽引入连续控制但破坏了范数保持，导致分布偏移和生成崩溃。

Method: 提出Selective Steering方法：1）数学上严格的范数保持旋转公式，保持激活分布完整性；2）区分性层选择，仅在特征表示呈现相反符号类别对齐的地方应用引导。

Result: 在九个模型上的实验表明，Selective Steering的攻击成功率比现有方法高5.5倍，同时保持零困惑度违规和约100%的标准基准能力保留。

Conclusion: 该方法为可控且稳定的大语言模型行为修改提供了一个原则性、高效的框架。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

TL;DR: SEAFormer是一个新型transformer模型，旨在有效解决复杂的现实世界车辆路径问题（RWVRPs），通过聚类邻近注意力机制和轻量级边感知模块提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法在处理现实世界车辆路径问题时表现不佳，因为它们忽视了序列依赖性和未能充分利用边级信息，而这些正是RWVRPs复杂性的关键所在。

Method: SEAFormer采用两个关键创新：1)聚类邻近注意力（CPA）通过局部感知聚类将注意力复杂度从O(n²)降低至O(n)；2)轻量级边感知模块通过残差融合捕获成对特征。

Result: 在四种不同规模的RWVRP变体上的广泛实验表明，SEAFormer优于最先进方法，首次有效解决了1000+节点的RWVRPs，并在经典VRP上也表现出色。

Conclusion: SEAFormer为研究基准和现实应用提供了一个通用解决方案，既能处理大规模复杂RWVRPs，也能在经典VRP上取得优越性能。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟集成电路设计自动化长期面临挑战，主要源于物理版图、寄生效应与电路性能之间的复杂关联性。传统设计方法难以准确捕捉和优化这些复杂约束，而现有机器学习方法通常只针对设计流程的特定阶段，缺乏集成的端到端框架。此外，模拟领域高质量开源数据集的稀缺，限制了机器学习技术的基准测试和泛化能力。

Conclusion: OSIRIS填补了模拟集成电路设计领域开源高质量数据集的空白，为机器学习驱动的电子设计自动化研究提供了关键基础设施，有望推动集成化、端到端模拟设计自动化框架的发展。

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过向量对齐方法LLM-VA，使得模型回答意愿与其安全评估因果关联，解决了LLMs中安全对齐失败的两个模式：破解攻击和过度拒答，无需微调，在12个LLMs上获得高F1性能并保持高实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量引导方法在减少破解攻击时会增加过度拒答，反之亦然，这是因为LLMs将回答决策和输入安全判断编码为近乎正交的独立方向，导致无法同时优化。

Method: 提出LLM-VA方法：1) 使用SVM识别每层的回答向量和良性向量；2) 选择安全相关层；3) 通过闭式权重更新对齐这两个向量方向，使模型回答意愿因果依赖于安全评估。无需微调或架构改动。

Result: 在12个LLM上的实验表明：LLM-VA获得比最佳基线高11.45%的F1值，同时保持95.92%的实用性，并能自动适应每个模型的安全偏差，无需手动调优。

Conclusion: LLM-VA通过向量对齐有效解决了安全对齐LLMs中的破解攻击和过度拒答之间的权衡问题，证明了将回答决策与安全判断进行因果关联的重要性，为LLM安全性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP.

Motivation: 当前深度模型过度依赖深度而缺乏对中间表示有效性的结构保证，导致早期停止和自适应计算难以实现。需要为状态空间模型建立尺度一致的潜在动力学结构要求。

Method: 提出FROST（分形平稳变换）框架，通过分形归纳偏置强制自相似的表示流形结构。在分形几何下，中间状态对应共享表示的不同分辨率，建立了收缩和稳定收敛的几何分析。

Result: 理论分析表明该结构支持自然停止机制，基于内在特征质量而非外在目标进行排序。在ImageNet-100上的实验验证了预测的尺度一致行为，自适应效率来自对齐的潜在几何结构。

Conclusion: FROST通过建立尺度一致的潜在表示结构，为深度模型提供了中间表示的有效性保证，使早期停止和自适应计算成为可能，自适应效率源于对齐的潜在几何而非任务特定的启发式方法。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在无人工标注数据情况下适应专业领域时面临挑战，传统的知识蒸馏方法容易陷入粗糙模仿，学生模型会无效地针对自身弱点并可能继承教师的推理缺陷。这暴露了一个关键的教学困境：当教师本身不是完美专家时，如何设计可靠的课程。

Method: DGRC通过分析学生与教师推理路径的分歧来动态构建两个互补的课程：1）通过诊断分析制定针对分歧点的原子查询，创建高置信度的原子问答对作为原子课程；2）使用这些原子问答作为事实标准来筛选教师的原始推理链，生成经过验证的思维链课程。

Result: 在医疗和法律领域的实验表明，DGRC框架对多种规模的学生模型均有效。值得注意的是，在医疗领域，1.5B参数的学生模型相对于强无标注基线获得了7.76%的相对提升。

Conclusion: DGRC通过利用LLM在原子子问题上的高置信度特点，巧妙解决了无完美专家教师情况下的课程设计问题，实现了从原子知识到复杂推理的有效教学，为专业领域LLM适应提供了有效的无标注学习方法。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: InfoNCE作为现代对比学习的核心损失函数，除经典的“对齐-均匀性”分解外，其几何机制尚未得到充分刻画。研究者旨在建立系统性框架，从表示分布演化的角度揭示对比学习的几何本质。

Method: 提出测度理论框架，将学习过程建模为固定嵌入流形上表示测度的演化。通过建立大批次极限下的值与梯度一致性，将随机目标桥接到确定性能量景观，系统分析了单模态与多模态两种几何分叉。

Result: 在单模态设定中，能量景观严格凸且存在唯一Gibbs平衡点，熵仅起决策作用，澄清“均匀性”实为对齐区域内的约束性扩张。而多模态目标始终存在负对称散度项，诱导屏障驱动的协同适应，使模态间差距成为几何必然而非初始化伪影。

Conclusion: 研究将分析视角从逐点判别转向种群几何学，为诊断和控制分布错配提供了理论基础，揭示了对比学习中几何分叉的结构性本质。

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Conclusion: R³机制能有效解决组内优势崩溃问题，提高推理模型的训练稳定性和效率，在数学任务中表现出优异的性能提升。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

Conclusion: ProToken为解决联邦大语言模型中的客户端溯源问题提供了一种有效方法，能够在保持联邦学习隐私约束的同时实现准确的令牌级归因，为联邦学习系统的调试、安全性和公平性提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对数据稀缺的新建海上风电场的迁移学习框架，通过聚类气象特征并训练专业模型集羣来提高功率预测精度，无需完整年度数据即可实现可靠预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新建海上风电场缺乏足够的本地数据，而传统机器学习模型需要大量站点特定数据才能进行准确的功率预测，这对电网稳定、储备管理和能源交易至关重要。

Method: 基于气象协变量对功率输出进行聚类，训练多个专业模型（每个模型针对特定天气模式），形成模型集羣进行预测。通过预训练模型捕获可迁移的气候依赖动态，减少对本地测量的依赖。

Result: 在八个海上风电场上的实验显示，仅使用不到五个月的站点特定数据即可实现准确的跨域预测，平均绝对误差(MAE)为3.52%，证明了无需完整年度周期也能获得可靠预测。

Conclusion: 该气候感知的迁移学习方法不仅改善了功率预测，还为风电资源早期评估等应用开辟了新机会，能显著缩短项目开发时间并有效降低风险。

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

TL;DR: LoPRo是一种免微调的训练后量化方法，通过块级置换、Walsh-Hadamard变换和基于rank-1草图分解的混合精度低秩分解来提升2-3位权重量化的精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前仅权重量化方法在低比特量化（尤其是3位以下）时精度下降严重，通常需要微调才能达到竞争性性能，作者旨在开发一种无需微调的高效低比特量化方法。

Method: 提出LoPRo算法：1）使用块级置换和Walsh-Hadamard变换旋转相似重要性的列，同时显式保留最重要列块的量化精度；2）引入基于rank-1草图分解的混合精度快速低秩分解以最小化量化成本。

Result: 实验显示LoPRo在2位和3位量化下优于现有免微调PTQ方法，达到与微调基线相当的精度：1）在LLaMA-2/3系列模型上实现SOTA量化精度，速度提升达4倍；2）在MoE模型Mixtral-8x7B上2.5小时内完成量化，困惑度降低0.4，精度提升8%；3）相比其他低秩量化方法，在更低秩条件下实现更高精度，同时保持高效推理和最小额外延迟。

Conclusion: LoPRo通过创新的矩阵变换和低秩分解策略，在不需微调的情况下有效解决了低比特权重量化的精度挑战，为大型语言模型的高效压缩提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

TL;DR: 提出了ODEdit框架，将MLLM知识编辑重新定义为OOD泛化问题，通过不变学习增强跨模态提示的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单模态LLM编辑方法依赖参数到输出的刚性映射，在多模态LLM中会导致因果欠拟合和过拟合问题，无法适应多样的跨模态提示。

Method: 将MLLM编辑重新定义为OOD泛化问题，提出ODEdit框架，包含：1）优化三方OOD风险目标以平衡编辑可靠性、局部性和通用性；2）引入编辑轨迹不变学习方法，通过全变差惩罚稳定轨迹。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验证明了ODEdit在跨模态提示下的编辑有效性，相比现有方法实现了更稳健的知识更新。

Conclusion: 通过将MLLM知识编辑视为OOD泛化问题并使用不变学习机制，ODEdit能够有效处理跨模态场景下的因果偏移，为多模态大模型的知识更新提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前基于目标的层次聚类方法生成的树状图缺乏三个关键属性：无不当分裂、相似聚类归为同一子集、与真实数据对应。这些问题源于使用面向集合的二分评估准则。

Method: 提出使用分布核代替面向集合的准则，从而实现新的分布导向目标，最大化所有聚类的总相似度。理论分析证明生成的树状图能保证TSC的下界。

Result: 在人工和生物信息学数据集上的评估表明，该方法生成的树状图与空间转录组学数据集中的生物区域一致，而其他方法失败。

Conclusion: 使用分布核能有效解决当前层次聚类方法的不足，生成更符合生物学意义的树状图结构。

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study grokking, the onset of generalization long after overfitting, in a classical ridge regression setting. We prove end-to-end grokking results for learning over-parameterized linear regression models using gradient descent with weight decay. Specifically, we prove that the following stages occur: (i) the model overfits the training data early during training; (ii) poor generalization persists long after overfitting has manifested; and (iii) the generalization error eventually becomes arbitrarily small. Moreover, we show, both theoretically and empirically, that grokking can be amplified or eliminated in a principled manner through proper hyperparameter tuning. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous quantitative bounds on the generalization delay (which we refer to as the "grokking time") in terms of training hyperparameters. Lastly, going beyond the linear setting, we empirically demonstrate that our quantitative bounds also capture the behavior of grokking on non-linear neural networks. Our results suggest that grokking is not an inherent failure mode of deep learning, but rather a consequence of specific training conditions, and thus does not require fundamental changes to the model architecture or learning algorithm to avoid.

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类泛化异常检测的目标是开发一个统一的模型。该模型主要依赖正常数据和少量异常数据进行学习，以检测完全未见过的异常（也称分布外OOD类别）。然而，异常数据稀少且标注成本高。为了解决这一挑战，本文旨在通过多向元学习算法实现更强的泛化能力。

Method: 提出多向元学习算法：在内部级别，模型学习正常数据流形（表示）；在外部级别，模型通过少量异常样本进行元调优，以最大化正常样本与异常样本之间的softmax置信度间隔（决策表面校准），将正常样本视为分布内（ID），异常视为分布外（OOD）。通过在多轮以正常样本为主、包含少量异常样本的情景中迭代此过程，实现多向元学习框架。这种通过多向训练增强的双层优化，能够实现对未见异常类别的更强泛化。

Result: 该方法通过多向元学习，有效提升了模型对未见异常类别的检测能力。通过表示学习和决策表面校准的双层优化，模型在异常数据稀少的情况下仍能实现强泛化。

Conclusion: 本文提出的多向元学习框架为解决类泛化异常检测问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。通过内部表示学习与外部决策表面校准的迭代优化，模型能够在缺乏大量异常样本的情况下，有效检测未见过的异常类别，实现更强的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Method: SDFT利用上下文学习，使用演示条件模型作为自身的教师，生成在线策略训练信号，在获取新技能的同时保留原有能力。通过自蒸馏实现持续学习

Result: 在技能学习和知识获取任务中，SDFT持续优于监督微调，获得更高的新任务准确率，同时显著减少灾难性遗忘。在顺序学习实验中，SDFT使单个模型能够随时间积累多个技能而无性能退化

Conclusion: 在线策略蒸馏是从演示中进行持续学习的实用路径，SDFT为此提供了简单有效的解决方案

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: Across cultures, water has served as a recipient of human confession, a yielding medium that receives vulnerability where rigid surfaces cannot. We present Whispering Water, an interactive installation that materializes human-AI dialogue through cymatic patterns on water. Participants confess secrets to a water surface, triggering a four-phase ritual: confession, contemplation, response, and release. The user's speech sentiment is directly transmitted into the water to prime its state, while semantic content enters a multi-agent system, initiating ripples of conversation where agent identities are situated through discourse and voice profiles are chosen based on what they say. We propose a novel algorithm that decomposes speech into component waves and reconstructs them in water, establishing a translation between speech and the physics of material form. By rendering machine reasoning as emergent physical phenomena, the installation explores possibilities for emotional self-exploration through ambiguous, sensory-rich interfaces.

We theorize that users will form an accurate predictive mental model of an algorithm's behavior if and only if the algorithm simultaneously satisfies three criteria: (1) cognitive availability of the underlying concepts being modeled, (2) concept compactness (does it form a single cognitive construct?), and (3) high alignment between the person's and algorithm's execution of the concept. We evaluate this theory through a pre-registered experiment (N=1250) where users predict behavior of 25 social media feed ranking algorithms that vary on these criteria. We find that even complex (e.g., LLM-based) algorithms enjoy accurate prediction rates when they meet all criteria, and even simple (e.g., basic term count) algorithms fail to be predictable when a single criterion fails. We also find that these criteria determine outcomes beyond prediction accuracy, such as which mental models users deploy to make their predictions.

Abstract: Extended Reality in early childhood education presents high-risk challenges due to children's rapid developmental changes. While augmented and virtual reality offer immersive pedagogical benefits, they often impose excessive cognitive load or sensory conflict. We introduce the Augmented Human Development (AHD) framework to model these interactions through cognitive, sensory, environmental, and developmental parameters. To ground this framework, we conducted a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) of 111 peer-reviewed studies involving children aged 3 - 8. Our findings, interpreted through the AHD lens, reveal a critical "risk vs. attention gap," where high-impact safety and security risks remain under-researched compared to short-term pedagogical gains.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨如何在痴呆症照护者访谈研究中，让有生活经验的顾问作为方法学合作伙伴参与研究方法设计，以提高研究质量和伦理敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症照护者研究存在方法和伦理挑战，特别是当访谈研究设计缺乏对实际照护现实的理解时，以临床或缺陷为导向的假设可能疏远参与者、破坏关系、产生肤浅或有伦理问题的数据。虽然HCI研究在技术设计中越来越多采用参与式方法，但这种参与很少扩展到研究方法本身的设计中。

Method: 进行了一项质性研究，让两位有广泛痴呆症照护经验的顾问在实地调查前作为方法学合作伙伴参与。通过分析顾问咨询记录和随后对十名照护者及一名痴呆症患者的访谈记录，评估顾问参与的研究方法贡献。

Result: 研究发现顾问参与带来两个关键方法学贡献：1) 通过预测照护挑战、伦理敏感性和解释性问题实现预期效度；2) 提供文化、情感和系统背景，提高解释敏感性和避免误读。

Conclusion: 生活经验可以作为方法学基础设施，将参与式原则扩展到研究设计和实施中，构成HCI研究与照护者及其他弱势或边缘化群体合作的可推广方法模式。

Abstract: Research with dementia caregivers poses persistent methodological and ethical challenges, particularly when interview-based studies are designed without sufficient grounding in lived caregiving realities. Questions framed through clinical or deficit-oriented assumptions risk alienating participants, undermining rapport, and producing shallow or ethically fraught data. While human-computer interaction (HCI) research increasingly adopts participatory approaches in technology design, participation rarely extends to the design of research methods themselves. This paper examines the role of lived-experience advisors as methodological partners in caregiver interview research. We report on a qualitative study in which two advisors with extensive dementia caregiving experience were engaged prior to fieldwork as methodological partners, extending participatory principles beyond technology design into the design of research methods themselves. Drawing on transcripts of advisor consultations and subsequent interviews with ten caregivers and one person living with dementia, we identify two key methodological contributions of advisor involvement. First, advisors enabled anticipatory validity by surfacing caregiving challenges, ethical sensitivities, and interpretive concerns that later appeared in caregiver interviews, allowing the researcher to enter the field with grounded awareness under constrained recruitment and fieldwork conditions. Second, advisors provided cultural, emotional, and systemic context that improved interpretive sensitivity and helped avoid misreadings. We argue that lived experience functions as methodological infrastructure, extending participatory principles into the design and conduct of research itself, and constituting a generalizable methodological pattern for HCI research with caregivers and other vulnerable or marginalized populations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过认知学徒模型指导大语言模型（如ChatGPT）充当设计导师，以提供更具反思性的设计反馈，而不是一次性通用建议。通过结构化提示实现认知学徒的六个教学方法，并在数据可视化设计任务中评估其效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM在设计任务中通常提供一次性的通用建议，限制了用户的反思性参与。为了提升设计反馈的质量并促进设计推理，研究者希望探索如何指导LLM像设计导师一样工作，以提供更深入、更具反思性的反馈。

Method: 研究者应用认知学徒模型，通过建模、辅导、脚手架、表达、反思和探索这六个教学方法，设计结构化提示来指导LLM。采用受试者内设计，让数据可视化从业者分别与基线LLM和基于认知学徒模型的指导型LLM互动，通过调查、访谈和对话日志分析比较两种条件下的体验。

Result: 基于认知学徒模型的提示能引发更深层次的设计推理和更反思性的反馈交流。但基线模型在某些任务类型或经验水平下有时更受青睐。研究为促进反思实践的AI辅助反馈系统提炼了设计考量。

Conclusion: 应用认知学徒模型的框架可以有效指导LLM提供更具反思性的设计反馈，提升设计推理的质量。然而，不同任务类型和经验水平的用户可能有不同的偏好，因此未来AI辅助反馈系统的设计需要兼顾这些因素。

Abstract: Design feedback helps practitioners improve their artifacts while also fostering reflection and design reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can support design work, but often provide generic, one-off suggestions that limit reflective engagement. We investigate how to guide LLMs to act as design mentors by applying the Cognitive Apprenticeship Model, which emphasizes demonstrating reasoning through six methods: modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. We operationalize these instructional methods through structured prompting and evaluate them in a within-subjects study with data visualization practitioners. Participants interacted with both a baseline LLM and an instructional LLM designed with cognitive apprenticeship prompts. Surveys, interviews, and conversational log analyses compared experiences across conditions. Our findings show that cognitively informed prompts elicit deeper design reasoning and more reflective feedback exchanges, though the baseline is sometimes preferred depending on task types or experience levels. We distill design considerations for AI-assisted feedback systems that foster reflective practice.

Abstract: Blind and visually impaired (BVI) computer science students face systematic barriers when learning data structures: current accessibility approaches typically translate diagrams into alternative text, focusing on visual appearance rather than preserving the underlying structure essential for conceptual understanding. More accessible alternatives often do not scale in complexity, cost to produce, or both. Motivated by a recent shift to tools for creating visual diagrams from code, we propose a solution that automatically creates accessible representations from structural information about diagrams. Based on a Wizard-of-Oz study, we derive design requirements for an automated system, Arboretum, that compiles text-based diagram specifications into three synchronized nonvisual formats$\unicode{x2013}$tabular, navigable, and tactile. Our evaluation with BVI users highlights the strength of tactile graphics for complex tasks such as binary search; the benefits of offering multiple, complementary nonvisual representations; and limitations of existing digital navigation patterns for structural reasoning. This work reframes access to data structures by preserving their structural properties. The solution is a practical system to advance accessible CS education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI虽然能从文本提示生成高质量UI，但用户难以准确表达设计意图、评估和优化结果，存在执行与评估的鸿沟（gulfs of execution and evaluation）。

Method: 1) 对UI提示指南进行主题分析，识别关键设计语义及其层级依赖关系；2) 开发支持语义指定、关系可视化及生成结果中语义提取的系统；3) 通过将语义作为人机意图与AI输出的中间表示来桥接执行与评估鸿沟。

Result: 对比用户研究表明，该方法增强了用户在意图表达、结果解释方面的感知控制力，支持更可预测的迭代优化。

Conclusion: 显式的语义表示能够在AI驱动的UI设计中实现系统化、可解释的设计可能性探索。

Abstract: While generative AI enables high-fidelity UI generation from text prompts, users struggle to articulate design intent and evaluate or refine results-creating gulfs of execution and evaluation. To understand the information needed for UI generation, we conducted a thematic analysis of UI prompting guidelines, identifying key design semantics and discovering that they are hierarchical and interdependent. Leveraging these findings, we developed a system that enables users to specify semantics, visualize relationships, and extract how semantics are reflected in generated UIs. By making semantics serve as an intermediate representation between human intent and AI output, our system bridges both gulfs by making requirements explicit and outcomes interpretable. A comparative user study suggests that our approach enhances users' perceived control over intent expression, outcome interpretation, and facilitates more predictable, iterative refinement. Our work demonstrates how explicit semantic representation enables systematic and explainable exploration of design possibilities in AI-driven UI design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前嗅觉界面依赖设计师预设触发和固定的事件-气味映射，难以适应无约束的内容，限制了嗅觉在交互媒体中的应用。需要开发智能化的气味规划方法来增强沉浸感。

Method: 提出视频-气味规划管道：1) 使用视觉语言模型提取视频语义内容；2) 利用大语言模型进行语义到气味的推理映射。通过两项调查研究比较系统生成的气味规划方案与过度包含和朴素基线方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，人们显著偏好那些优先考虑感知显著性线索、并且气味变化与可见动作对齐的规划方案。这支持了语义规划作为未来嗅觉媒体系统基础的可行性。

Conclusion: 基于语义规划的视频到气味映射方法能够有效提高嗅觉媒体的可扩展性和用户体验，为未来智能嗅觉接口的发展提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: Olfactory cues can enhance immersion in interactive media, yet smell remains rare because it is difficult to author and synchronize with dynamic video. Prior olfactory interfaces rely on designer triggers and fixed event-to-odor mappings that do not scale to unconstrained content. This work examines whether semantic planning for smell is intelligible to people before physical scent delivery. We present a video-to-scent planning pipeline that separates visual semantic extraction using a vision-language model from semantic-to-olfactory inference using a large language model. Two survey studies compare system-generated scent plans with over-inclusive and naive baselines. Results show consistent preference for plans that prioritize perceptually salient cues and align scent changes with visible actions, supporting semantic planning as a foundation for future olfactory media systems.

Motivation: 现有可视化设计空间的正式表示方法（如知识库）通常依赖固定的人工编写规则，难以创建新颖表示或扩展到不同可视化领域。

Method: 通过自动提取可视化语料库中的候选设计特征，进行前向和后向特征选择，最终生成知识库。

Result: 在基准评估中，相比Draco 2，合成的知识库提供了更通用和可解释的设计特征，并在不同训练和测试集上将有效设计预测准确性提高了1-15%。应用于基因组学可视化时，准确率高达97%。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动方法能够自动合成可视化设计知识库，具有更好的通用性、可解释性和跨领域适用性，显著改善了设计推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Formal representations of the visualization design space, such as knowledge bases and graphs, consolidate design practices into a shared resource and enable automated reasoning and interpretable design recommendations. However, prior approaches typically depend on fixed, manually authored rules, making it difficult to build novel representations or extend them for different visualization domains. Instead, we propose data-driven methods that automatically synthesize visualization design knowledge bases. Specifically, our methods (1) extract candidate design features from a visualization corpus, (2) select features forward and backward, and (3) render the final knowledge base. In our benchmark evaluation compared to Draco 2, our synthesized knowledge base offers general and interpretable design features and improves the accuracy of predicting effective designs by 1-15% in varied training and test sets. When we apply our approach to genomics visualization, the synthesized knowledge base includes sensible features with accuracy up to 97%, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to other visualization domains.

Abstract: Modern mobile applications rely on hidden interactions--gestures without visual cues like long presses and swipes--to provide functionality without cluttering interfaces. While experienced users may discover these interactions through prior use or onboarding tutorials, their implicit nature makes them difficult for most users to uncover. Similarly, mobile agents--systems designed to automate tasks on mobile user interfaces, powered by vision language models (VLMs)--struggle to detect veiled interactions or determine actions for completing tasks. To address this challenge, we present GhostUI, a new dataset designed to enable the detection of hidden interactions in mobile applications. GhostUI provides before-and-after screenshots, simplified view hierarchies, gesture metadata, and task descriptions, allowing VLMs to better recognize concealed gestures and anticipate post-interaction states. Quantitative evaluations with VLMs show that models fine-tuned on GhostUI outperform baseline VLMs, particularly in predicting hidden interactions and inferring post-interaction screens, underscoring GhostUI's potential as a foundation for advancing mobile task automation.

Abstract: Communication and computer interaction are important for autonomy in modern life. Unfortunately, these capabilities can be limited or inaccessible for the millions of people living with paralysis. While implantable brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) show promise for restoring these capabilities, little has been explored on designing BCI user interfaces (UIs) for sustained daily use. Here, we present a personalized UI for an intracortical BCI system that enables users with severe paralysis to communicate and interact with their computers independently. Through a 22-month longitudinal deployment with one participant, we used iterative co-design to develop a system for everyday at-home use and documented how it evolved to meet changing needs. Our findings highlight how personalization and adaptability enabled independence in daily life and provide design implications for developing future BCI assistive technologies.

Result: 用户研究中，参与者在53%的任务尝试中实现了正确的注视选择，并使用语音消歧校正了剩余错误中的58%。参与者认为该系统易于使用且有用。

Conclusion: Gazeify then Voiceify是一种有效的多模态交互方法，能够提升无显示屏智能眼镜的用户体验，通过注视和语音的组合实现可靠的物体选择和交互。

Abstract: Smart glasses enhance interactions with the environment by using head-mounted cameras to observe the user's viewpoint, but lack the visual feedback used for common interactions. We introduce Gazeify then Voiceify, a multimodal approach allowing object selection via gaze and voice using displayless smart glasses. Users can select a physical object with their gaze, and the system generates a digital mask and a voice description of the object's semantics. Users can further correct errors through free-form conversation. To demonstrate our approach, we develop an interactive system by integrating advanced object segmentation and detection with a vision-language model. User studies reveal that participants achieve correct gaze selection in 53% of the task trials and use voice disambiguation to correct 58% of the remaining errors. Participants also rated the system as likable, useful, and easy to use.

Abstract: Spoken English proficiency is a powerful driver of economic mobility for low-income Indian youth, yet opportunities for spoken practice remain scarce in schools. We investigate the deployment of a voice-based chatbot for English conversation practice across four low-resource schools in Delhi. Through a six-day field study combining observations and interviews, we captured the perspectives of students, teachers, and principals. Findings confirm high demand across all groups, with notable gains in student speaking confidence. Our multi-stakeholder analysis surfaced a tension in long-term adoption vision: students favored open-ended conversational practice, while administrators emphasized curriculum-aligned assessment. We offer design recommendations for voice-enabled chatbots in low-resource multilingual contexts, highlighting the need for more intelligible speech output for non-native learners, one-tap interactions with simplified interfaces, and actionable analytics for educators. Beyond language learning, our findings inform the co-design of future AI-based educational technologies that are socially sustainable within the complex ecosystem of low-resource schools.

Abstract: Preparing an oral case presentation (OCP) is a crucial skill for medical students, requiring clear communication of patient information, clinical findings, and treatment plans. However, inconsistent student participation and limited guidance can make this task challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide structured content to streamline the process, their role in facilitating skill development and supporting medical education integration remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted a formative study with six medical educators and developed CaseMaster, an interactive probe that leverages LLM-generated content tailored to medical education to help users enhance their OCP skills. The controlled study suggests CaseMaster has the potential to both improve presentation quality and reduce workload compared to traditional methods, an implication reinforced by expert feedback. We propose guidelines for educators to develop adaptive, user-centered training methods using LLMs, while considering the implications of integrating advanced technologies into medical education.

Abstract: Online comments significantly influence users' judgments, yet their presentation, often determined by platform algorithms, can introduce biases, such as anchoring effects, which distort reasoning. While existing research emphasizes mitigating individual cognitive biases, the evolution of user judgments during comment engagement remains overlooked. This study investigates how presentation cues impact reasoning and explores interface design strategies to mitigate bias. Through a preliminary experiment (N=18) and a co-design workshop, we identified key challenges users face across a four-stage process and distilled four design requirements: pre-engagement framing, interactive organization, reflective prompts, and synthesis support. Based on these insights, we developed CommSense, an on-the-fly plugin that enhances user engagement with online comments by providing visual overviews and lightweight prompts to guide reasoning. A between-subject evaluation (N=24) demonstrates that CommSense improves bias awareness and reflective thinking, helping users produce more comprehensive, evidence-based rationales while maintaining high usability.

Motivation: 每年约119万人死于交通事故，使用AMR技术可以通过在关键目标上覆盖信息以提升驾驶员意识、简化交通场景或减少干扰来增强驾驶安全。但真实世界中的AMR评估因技术挑战而受限，存在模拟与现实间的差距。

Method: 开发MIRAGE开源工具，采用最先进的计算模型实现对象检测与分割、深度估计和图像修复，在真实车辆中实现实时AMR效果。包括15种涵盖增强现实(如轮廓、图标、文本覆盖)、减弱现实(减少干扰)和修改现实(改变对象外观)的效果。通过道路专家用户研究(N=9)评估该工具。

Conclusion: MIRAGE填补了AMR技术在模拟到现实应用之间的空白，通过开源工具促进真实驾驶环境中AMR的研究与评估。道路测试为AMR在实际应用中的可行性和改进方向提供了宝贵见解，同时引发了关于AMR伦理和交互设计的思考。

Abstract: Traffic is inherently dangerous, with around 1.19 million fatalities annually. Automotive Mediated Reality (AMR) can enhance driving safety by overlaying critical information (e.g., outlines, icons, text) on key objects to improve awareness, altering objects' appearance to simplify traffic situations, and diminishing their appearance to minimize distractions. However, real-world AMR evaluation remains limited due to technical challenges. To fill this sim-to-real gap, we present MIRAGE, an open-source tool that enables real-time AMR in real vehicles. MIRAGE implements 15 effects across the AMR spectrum of augmented, diminished, and modified reality using state-of-the-art computational models for object detection and segmentation, depth estimation, and inpainting. In an on-road expert user study (N=9) of MIRAGE, participants enjoyed the AMR experience while pointing out technical limitations and identifying use cases for AMR. We discuss these results in relation to prior work and outline implications for AMR ethics and interaction design.

Conclusion: HITL MOBO为设计主动式车载语音助手提供了有效的计算框架。ProVoice系统可扩展更多设计参数和驾驶场景，支持大规模干预策略设计，为未来主动交互研究提供了方法论参考

Abstract: The next step for In-vehicle Conversational Assistants (IVCAs) will be their capability to initiate and automate proactive system interactions throughout journeys. However, diverse drivers make it challenging to design voice interventions tailored towards individual on-road expectations. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) in design by implementing ProVoice: a Virtual Reality (VR) driving simulator integrating MOBO to investigate the effects of IVCA design variants on perceived mental demand, predictability, and usefulness. By reporting the Pareto Front from a within-subjects VR study (N=19), this paper proposes optimal design trade-offs. Follow-up analysis demonstrates MOBO's success in discovering effective intervention strategies, with reduced participant mental demand, alongside enhanced predictability and usefulness while engaging with the proactive IVCA. Implications for computational techniques in future research on proactive intervention strategies are discussed. ProVoice can extend to include alternative design parameters and driving scenarios, encouraging intervention design on a broad scale.

TL;DR: 研究比较了自动驾驶车辆外部人机接口(eHMI)对行人、骑行者及手动驾驶者的效果，发现统一eHMI设计能有效改善安全感知、信任度等指标，支持标准化推广


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆外部人机接口研究主要关注行人交互，缺乏对其他道路使用者(如骑行者、手动驾驶者)的比较研究，需要评估eHMI在不同道路使用者角色中的通用有效性

Method: 采用被试内设计的虚拟现实实验(N=40)，评估eHMI在传达自动驾驶车辆意图时对行人、骑行者、驾驶者的主客观影响，包含无干扰、视觉噪声、干扰三种分心水平

Result: eHMI对所有道路使用者角色均能提升安全感知、信任、感知有用性和心理负荷；虽然分心水平和道路使用者角色有显著主效应，但仅感知可用性存在交互效应

Conclusion: 统一eHMI设计对各类道路使用者都有效，有助于促进eHMI的标准化和在不同交通场景中的广泛应用

Abstract: With automated vehicles (AVs), the absence of a human operator could necessitate external Human-Machine Interfaces (eHMIs) to communicate with other road users. Existing research primarily focuses on pedestrian-AV interactions, with limited attention given to other road users, such as cyclists and drivers of manually driven vehicles. So far, no studies have compared the effects of eHMIs across these three road user roles. Therefore, we conducted a within-subjects virtual reality experiment (N=40), evaluating the subjective and objective impact of an eHMI communicating the AV's intention to pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers under various levels of distraction (no distraction, visual noise, interference). eHMIs positively influenced safety perceptions, trust, perceived usefulness, and mental demand across all roles. While distraction and road user roles showed significant main effects, interaction effects were only observed in perceived usability. Thus, a unified eHMI design is effective, facilitating the standardization and broader adoption of eHMIs in diverse traffic.

TL;DR: 针对AR眼镜在家庭环境中的隐私保护问题，提出VisGuardian细粒度视觉权限控制技术，通过基于群体的控制机制有效管理多隐私对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR眼镜的常开式传感在家庭环境中面临严重隐私挑战，现有细粒度控制难以高效管理多个隐私对象，需要更适用的隐私控制机制。

Method: 提出VisGuardian技术，使用YOLO检测物体，采用预分类模式分组，通过选择单一物体即可基于隐私敏感度、类别或空间邻近性快速遮蔽相关群体。

Result: 技术评估显示mAP50达0.6704，延迟仅14.0毫秒，每小时电池消耗增加1.7%；用户研究(N=24)表明比滑块式和对象式基线更快设置权限，用户更偏爱其效率、效果和易用性。

Conclusion: VisGuardian为AR眼镜在家庭环境提供了一种高效可行的细粒度视觉隐私控制方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Always-on sensing of AI applications on AR glasses makes traditional permission techniques ill-suited for context-dependent visual data, especially within home environments. The home presents a highly challenging privacy context due to the high density of sensitive objects, and the frequent presence of non-consenting family members, and the intimate nature of daily routines, making it a critical focus area for scalable privacy control mechanisms. Existing fine-grained controls, while offering nuanced choices, are inefficient for managing multiple private objects. We propose VisGuardian, a fine-grained content-based visual permission technique for AR glasses. VisGuardian features a group-based control mechanism that enables users to efficiently manage permissions for multiple private objects. VisGuardian detects objects using YOLO and adopts a pre-classified schema to group them. By selecting a single object, users can efficiently obscure groups of related objects based on criteria including privacy sensitivity, object category, or spatial proximity. A technical evaluation shows VisGuardian achieves mAP50 of 0.6704 with only 14.0 ms latency and a 1.7% increase in battery consumption per hour. Furthermore, a user study (N=24) comparing VisGuardian to slider-based and object-based baselines found it to be significantly faster for setting permissions and was preferred by users for its efficiency, effectiveness, and ease of use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown considerable potential in supporting medical diagnosis. However, their effective integration into clinical workflows is hindered by physicians' difficulties in perceiving and trusting LLM capabilities, which often results in miscalibrated trust. Existing model evaluations primarily emphasize standardized benchmarks and predefined tasks, offering limited insights into clinical reasoning practices. Moreover, research on human-AI collaboration has rarely examined physicians' perceptions of LLMs' clinical reasoning capability. In this work, we investigate how physicians perceive LLMs' capabilities in the clinical reasoning process. We designed clinical cases, collected the corresponding analyses, and obtained evaluations from physicians (N=37) to quantitatively represent their perceived LLM diagnostic capabilities. By comparing the perceived evaluations with benchmark performance, our study highlights the aspects of clinical reasoning that physicians value and underscores the limitations of benchmark-based evaluation. We further discuss the implications of opportunities for enhancing trustworthy collaboration between physicians and LLMs in LLM-supported clinical reasoning.

TL;DR: 针对HCI等领域研究者数据匿名化实施困难的问题，提出通过红蓝队对抗模拟重识别攻击的方法来指导数据保护实践


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究人员在数据匿名化方面存在困难，主要是因为缺乏清晰、可操作的指导。针对这一挑战，研究旨在探索一种有效的方法来帮助研究人员更好地进行数据匿名化和发布。

Method: 采用红蓝队对抗技术，模拟重识别攻击：一支团队尝试重新识别数据，另一支团队则努力防止此类识别。将该方法应用于一项混合方法研究中收集的数据。

Result: 提供了可供研究人员在实际数据匿名化和发布过程中使用的红队对抗材料。通过应用这一方法，获得了关于数据保护实践的有价值经验。

Conclusion: 红蓝队对抗方法为研究人员提供了一个实用的数据匿名化指导框架，有助于提升数据保护实践的质量，并为未来研究提供了可扩展的工具和方法论。

Abstract: Recently, the data protection practices of researchers in human-computer interaction and elsewhere have gained attention. Initial results suggest that researchers struggle with anonymization, partly due to a lack of clear, actionable guidance. In this work, we propose simulating re-identification attacks using the approach of red teaming versus blue teaming: a technique commonly employed in security testing, where one team tries to re-identify data, and the other team tries to prevent it. We discuss our experience applying this method to data collected in a mixed-methods study in human-centered privacy. We present usable materials for researchers to apply red teaming when anonymizing and publishing their studies' data.

Abstract: Autonomy and independent navigation are vital to daily life but remain challenging for individuals with blindness. Robotic systems can enhance mobility and confidence by providing intelligent navigation assistance. However, fully autonomous systems may reduce users' sense of control, even when they wish to remain actively involved. Although collaboration between user and robot has been recognized as important, little is known about how perceptions of this relationship change with repeated use. We present a repeated exposure study with six blind participants who interacted with a navigation-assistive robot in a real-world museum. Participants completed tasks such as navigating crowds, approaching lines, and encountering obstacles. Findings show that participants refined their strategies over time, developing clearer preferences about when to rely on the robot versus act independently. This work provides insights into how strategies and preferences evolve with repeated interaction and offers design implications for robots that adapt to user needs over time.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ELF，一种无编码器的ECG语言模型，使用单层投影层替代复杂编码器，在多个数据集上达到或超越现有最先进模型，并揭示了当前评估方法和ELM设计中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ECG语言模型大多基于视觉语言模型架构，依赖预训练的ECG编码器，增加了结构和训练复杂性。为了简化架构、降低训练难度，研究者设计了一种无编码器的ECG语言模型。

Method: 方法包括：1) 用单层投影层直接替换复杂的ECG编码器，与大型语言模型联合训练；2) 在五个数据集上对比评估ELF与现有ELM；3) 测试添加架构偏置是否提升性能；4) 分析模型依赖信息来源（基准伪影、语言先验与ECG信息）。

Result: 1) ELF在性能上匹配或超越使用更复杂编码器和训练流水线的现有ELM；2) 单线性投影层仍保持竞争力，添加架构偏置未明显改善性能；3) 分析显示ELF和其他ELM往往更依赖基准伪影和语言先验，而非ECG信息本身。

Conclusion: 无编码器ECG语言模型ELF展示了解码ECG的简单高效方法，同时揭示了当前ECG语言模型评估和设计中的根本问题：过度依赖非ECG信息源，需要更严谨的评估实践。

Abstract: ECG-Language Models (ELMs) extend recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automated ECG interpretation. However, most ELMs follow Vision-Language Model (VLM) designs and depend on pretrained ECG encoders, adding architectural and training complexity. Inspired by encoder-free VLMs, we introduce ELF, an encoder-free ELM that replaces the ECG encoder with a single projection layer trained jointly with the LLM. Across five datasets, ELF matches or exceeds state-of-the-art ELMs that use far more complex encoders and training pipelines. We also test whether adding architectural biases to ELF improves performance and find that the single linear projection remains competitive. Finally, we show that ELF, and potentially other ELMs, often rely more on benchmark artifacts and language priors than ECG-derived information, highlighting limitations in current evaluation practices and ELM design. All data and code is available at https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.

Abstract: Missing-modality information on e-commerce platforms, such as absent product images or textual descriptions, often arises from annotation errors or incomplete metadata, impairing both product presentation and downstream applications such as recommendation systems. Motivated by the multimodal generative capabilities of recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), this work investigates a fundamental yet underexplored question: can MLLMs generate missing modalities for products in e-commerce scenarios? We propose the Missing Modality Product Completion Benchmark (MMPCBench), which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.
  We further evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families across nine real-world e-commerce categories, focusing on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks. Experimental results show that while MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel- or patch-level alignment. In addition, performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, and we observe no trivial correlation between model size and performance, in contrast to trends commonly reported in mainstream benchmarks. We also explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with this task. GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion. Overall, these findings expose the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation and represent an early step toward more effective missing-modality product completion.

Abstract: Bandwidth constraints in live streaming require video codecs to balance compression strength and frame rate, yet the perceptual consequences of this trade-off remain underexplored. We present the high frame rate live streaming (HFR-LS) dataset, comprising 384 subject-rated 1080p videos encoded at multiple target bitrates by systematically varying compression strength and frame rate. A single-stimulus, hidden-reference subjective study shows that frame rate has a noticeable effect on perceived quality, and interacts with both bitrate and source content. The HFR-LS dataset is available at https://github.com/real-hjq/HFR-LS to facilitate research on bitrate-constrained live streaming.
