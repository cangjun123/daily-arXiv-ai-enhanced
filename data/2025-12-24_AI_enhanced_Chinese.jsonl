This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines.

These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE.

We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction.

Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs.

Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\\% and degrading safety-critical communication.

Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, since preferences of each user may vary, existing under-specified formulations often lead to suboptimal results that fail to align with individual user needs. We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, there are few studies that explore its potential for predicting student behavior in a procedural training environment. This paper presents a collective student model, which is built from past student logs. These logs are firstly grouped into clusters. Then an extended automaton is created for each cluster based on the sequences of events found in the cluster logs. The main objective of this model is to predict the actions of new students for improving the tutoring feedback provided by an intelligent tutoring system. The proposed model has been validated using student logs collected in a 3D virtual laboratory for teaching biotechnology. As a result of this validation, we concluded that the model can provide reasonably good predictions and can support tutoring feedback that is better adapted to each student type.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\u03b5$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u707e\u540e\u6551\u63f4\u7269\u8d44\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u914d\u9001\u6548\u7387\uff08\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u884c\u9a76\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u5206\u914d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u5c3c\u7cfb\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u5927\u707e\u5bb3\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u7f6e\u7269\u8d44\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u7269\u8d44\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08MIP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u03b5-\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed9\u5b9a\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u9001\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b5. \u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08Branch-and-Price\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "1. \u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1aMIP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff1b2. \u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u6551\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8634%\uff1b3. \u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u5bbd\u677e\u6216\u6781\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e2d\u7b49\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u707e\u540e\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u7269\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Establishing Baselines for Foundation Models in Educational Discourse", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in educational technologies for a variety of tasks, from generating instructional materials and assisting with assessment design to tutoring. While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To investigate how technology workers navigate these humanlike qualities and anticipate emergent harms, we conducted focus groups with 30 professionals across six job functions (ML engineering, product policy, UX research and design, product management, technology writing, and communications). Our findings reveal an unsettled knowledge environment surrounding humanlike generative AI, where workers' varying perspectives illuminate a range of potential risks for individuals, knowledge work fields, and society. We argue that workers require comprehensive support, including clearer conceptions of ``humanlikeness'' to effectively mitigate these risks.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions.

Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively.

In fact, the most common way to help a human with a pattern interpretation is through a graphic. In 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training the student interaction is more varied and complex than in traditional e-learning environments. Therefore, the visualization and interpretation of students' behaviors becomes a challenge. This motivated us to design the visualization of a collective student model built from student logs taken from 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training. This paper presents the design decisions that enable a suitable visualization of this model to instructors as well as a web tool that implements this visualization and is intended: to help instructors to improve their own teaching; and to enhance the tutoring strategy of an Intelligent Tutoring System. Then, this paper illustrates, with three detailed examples, how this tool can be used to those educational purposes. Next, the paper presents an experiment for validating the utility of the tool. In this experiment we show how the tool can help to modify the tutoring strategy of a 3D virtual laboratory. In this way, it is shown that the proposed visualization of the model can serve to improve the performance of students in 2D/3D virtual environments for procedural training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Shekhovtsov"], "title": "RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check", "comment": null, "summary": "We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.\n  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.\n  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.\n  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86RANSAC\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7403\u9762\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9MAGSAC++\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86MAGSAC++\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u62df\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fRANSAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u7684MAGSAC++\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7403\u9762\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2) \u5728\u7a33\u5065\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7edf\u4e00\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u548cM\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b3) \u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ee\u9898\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6216\u5c0f\u968f\u673a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6765\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) MAGSAC++\u7684\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b58\u5728\u539f\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9ad8\u65af-\u5747\u5300\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5185\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\uff1b3) MAGSAC++\u5e76\u4e0d\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5bf9\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e5f\u4e0d\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MAGSAC++\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7a33\u5065\u62df\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6279\u5224\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues.

While their responses often sound fluent and natural, they can also carry subtle tone biases such as sounding overly polite, cheerful, or cautious even when neutrality is expected. These tendencies can influence how users perceive trust, empathy, and fairness in dialogue. In this study, we explore tone bias as a hidden behavioral trait of large language models. The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues.

These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis.

We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS).

The aim of this paper is (1) to demonstrate a feasible mixed-method study design with controlled and uncontrolled study periods within a firm setting, (2) to give first insights from complementary behavioral and subjective experience data on developers' interaction with GitHub Copilot and (3) to compare the impact of interaction types (no Copilot use, in-code suggestions, chat prompts or both in-code suggestions and chat prompts) on efficiency, accuracy and perceived workload whilst working on different task categories. Results of the controlled sessions in this study indicate that moderate use of either in-code suggestions or chat prompts improves efficiency (task duration) and reduces perceived workload compared to not using Copilot, while excessive or combined use lessens these benefits. Accuracy (task completion) profits from chat interaction. In general, subjective perception of workload aligns with objective behavioral data in this study. During the uncontrolled period of the study, both higher cognitive load and productivity were perceived when interacting with AI during everyday working tasks.

Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain.

However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\\%.

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan.

Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint.

During this workshop, participants will experience a structured three-phase methodology: creating a human-led narrative foundation, identifying strategic gaps, and collaborating on AI enhancements. The workshop combines theoretical foundations with intensive hands-on practice, enabling participants to create compelling HCI visual narratives that demonstrate effective human-AI partnership. Through sequential art techniques, storyboarding exercises, and guided AI integration, attendees learn to communicate complex interactive concepts, accessibility solutions, and user experience flows while preserving narrative coherence and creative vision.

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via M\u00f6bius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs.

Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating.

To address this limitation, we present RESPOND, a structured decision-making framework for LLM-driven agents grounded in explicit risk patterns. RESPOND represents each ego-centric scene using a unified 5 by 3 matrix that encodes spatial topology and road constraints, enabling consistent and reliable retrieval of spatial risk configurations. Based on this representation, a hybrid rule and LLM decision pipeline is developed with a two-tier memory mechanism. In high-risk contexts, exact pattern matching enables rapid and safe reuse of verified actions, while in low-risk contexts, sub-pattern matching supports personalized driving style adaptation. In addition, a pattern-aware reflection mechanism abstracts tactical corrections from crash and near-miss frames to update structured memory, achieving one-crash-to-generalize learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RESPOND. In highway-env, RESPOND outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and reinforcement learning based driving agents while producing substantially fewer collisions. With step-wise human feedback, the agent acquires a Sporty driving style within approximately 20 decision steps through sub-pattern abstraction. For real-world validation, RESPOND is evaluated on 53 high-risk cut-in scenarios extracted from the HighD dataset.

Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations.

To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RetroPrompt\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bb0\u5fc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u9075\u5faa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5178\u578b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "RetroPrompt\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u7528\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRetroPrompt\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6b7b\u8bb0\u786c\u80cc\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "RetroPrompt\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives.

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks.

Constraint solvers enforce structural and perceptual validity, but the rules they require are difficult to author and too rigid to capture situated design knowledge. Large language models require no formal rules and can reason about contextual nuance, but they prioritize popular conventions over empirically grounded best practices. We address this tension by proposing a cataloging scheme that structures visualization design knowledge as natural-language guidelines with semantically typed metadata. This allows experts to author knowledge that machines can query. An expert study ($N=18$) indicates that practitioners routinely adapt heuristics to situational factors such as audience and communicative intent. To capture this reasoning, guideline sections specify not only advice but also the contexts where it applies, exceptions that invalidate it, and the sources from which it derives. We demonstrate the scheme's expressiveness by cataloging 744 guidelines drawn from cognitive science, accessibility standards, data journalism, and research on rhetorical aspects of visual communication. We embed guideline sections in a vector space, opening the knowledge itself to structural analysis. This reveals conflicting advice across sources and transferable principles between domains. Rather than replacing constraint-based tools, our scheme provides what they lack: situated guidance that generative systems can retrieve to ground their reasoning, users can verify against cited sources, and experts can author as knowledge evolves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u5e26\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ee5\u8c03\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u8f83\u4e3a\u50f5\u5316\uff09\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840\u4e14\u504f\u5411\u6d41\u884c\u60ef\u4f8b\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f20\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u53c8\u4fbf\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76ee\u5f55\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u8fbe\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u4f8b\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u7b49\u8bed\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u5357\uff1b\u4ece\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6536\u96c6\u4e86744\u6761\u6307\u5357\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u7814\u7a76\uff08N=18\uff09\u8868\u660e\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5e38\u6839\u636e\u53d7\u4f17\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u610f\u56fe\u7b49\u60c5\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u8c03\u6574\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u5411\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u95f4\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u51b2\u7a81\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u6240\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u7d22\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u5bf9\u7167\u5f15\u7528\u6765\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e5f\u80fd\u968f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6f14\u8fdb\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance.

This is the author accepted manuscript", "summary": "As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aCNN\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u75c5\u5bb3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8699.99%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u56fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u519c\u4e1a\u5927\u56fd\uff0c\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u662f\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u70ed\u5e26\u6c34\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u70ad\u75bd\u75c5\u548c\u679c\u8747\u611f\u67d3\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u54c1\u8d28\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u6536\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CNN\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fCNN-ML\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728GFDD24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea699.99%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u679c\u8747\u611f\u67d3\u3001\u70ad\u75bd\u75c5", "conclusion": "CNN-ML\u7ea7\u8054\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u756a\u77f3\u69b4\u75c5\u5bb3\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf"}}

This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u6570\u5b66\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u6307\u5bfc\u5e26\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5c06\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5143\u5bf9\u9519\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728MetaMathQA\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5f15\u5165\u7d27\u51d1\u7684MathVerifier\u5c06\u5019\u9009\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u516d\u7ef4\u9519\u8bef\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u6027\u548c\u8352\u8c2c\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4fe1\u53f7\u7528\u4e8e\u6316\u6398\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7ecf\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d", "result": "\u57281.5B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen2.5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u6743DPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u975e\u52a0\u6743DPO\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6570\u503c\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u80fd\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9519\u8bef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

The inclusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) plays a central role in this shift, yet its influence on job satisfaction remains underexplored. In response, this study developed a human-centered measurement model for evaluating job satisfaction in BIM work environments by adapting Hackman and Oldham's Job Characteristics Model for the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry to create a survey that captured industry perspectives on BIM use and job satisfaction. The model uses Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the survey results and identify what dimensions of BIM-related work affect job satisfaction. While it was hypothesized that BIM use increases job satisfaction, the results show that only some dimensions of BIM use positively impact BIM job satisfaction; the use of BIM does not guarantee an increase in overall job satisfaction. Additionally, more frequent BIM use was not associated with higher satisfaction levels. These findings suggest that in the AEC industry, sustainable job satisfaction depends less on technological autonomy and more on human-centric factors, particularly collaboration and meaningful engagement within digital workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality.

To evaluate automatic systems for such a task, a versatile and realistic evaluation corpus is needed. Therefore, we create and present a corpus of cross-lingual dialogues between individuals without a common language who were facilitated by automatic simultaneous speech translation. The corpus consists of 5 hours of speech recordings with ASR and gold transcripts in 12 original languages and automatic and corrected translations into English. For the purposes of research into cross-lingual summarization, our corpus also includes written summaries (minutes) of the meetings.\n  Moreover, we propose automatic detection of misunderstandings. For an overview of this task and its complexity, we attempt to quantify misunderstandings in cross-lingual meetings. We annotate misunderstandings manually and also test the ability of current large language models to detect them automatically.

However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

DOI: 10.1109/TIFS.2025.3610254", "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation.

This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes.

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively).

This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

We address this gap for Bangla by introducing BanglaRiddleEval, a benchmark of 1,244 traditional Bangla riddles instantiated across four tasks (4,976 riddle-task artifacts in total). Using an LLM-based pipeline, we generate Chain-of-Thought explanations, semantically coherent distractors, and fine-grained ambiguity annotations, and evaluate a diverse suite of open-source and closed-source models under different prompting strategies. Models achieve moderate semantic overlap on generative QA but low correctness, MCQ accuracy peaks at only about 56% versus an 83% human baseline, and ambiguity resolution ranges from roughly 26% to 68%, with high-quality explanations confined to the strongest models. These results show that current LLMs capture some cues needed for Bangla riddle reasoning but remain far from human-level performance, establishing BanglaRiddleEval as a challenging new benchmark for low-resource figurative reasoning.

Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios.

Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Experimental results show that Step-DeepResearch (32B) scores 61.4% on Scale AI Research Rubrics. On ADR-Bench, it significantly outperforms comparable models and rivals SOTA closed-source models like OpenAI and Gemini DeepResearch.

However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $\u03b7^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $\u03b1=0.05$ threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \\citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u53d6\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529bTransformer\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u6602\u8d35\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8LLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u5c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u662f\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u901a\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u83b7\u53d6\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fdb\u884c\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528RADLADS\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u5747\u5300\u4ea4\u9519\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u95e8\u8bca\u65ad\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u914d\u65b9\u7ed3\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction.

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bohrium+SciMaster\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c4\u6a21\u5316agentic science\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u7528\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u89c4\u6a21\u5316agentic science\u9762\u4e34\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u6267\u884c\u96be\u4ee5\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u539f\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u5f3a\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u7528\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBohrium\u4f5c\u4e3aAI4S\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u7684HuggingFace\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002SciMaster\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u6392\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u5f62\u6210\u957f\u671f\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u677f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc711\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u79d1\u5b66\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c4\u6a21\u5316agentic science\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cBohrium+SciMaster\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u3001\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5371\u91cd\u60a3\u8005\u4f11\u514b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u672a\u663e\u793aLLMs\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f11\u514b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d17,294\u6b21ICU\u4f4f\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4f\u9662\u65f6\u95f4>24\u5c0f\u65f6\u548c\u4f11\u514b\u6307\u6570>0.7\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa355\u4f8b\u6b63\u5e38\u548c87\u4f8b\u5f02\u5e38\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86GatorTron-Base\u3001Llama 8B\u3001Mistral 7B\u7b49LLMs\u4e0eBioBERT\u3001DocBERT\u7b49SLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u7126\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "GatorTron-Base\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8680.5%\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u770bLLMs\u548cSLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u975e\u5929\u751f\u4f18\u4e8eSLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u672a\u6765LLMs\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c5\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Cube available at https://github.com/dana-23/cube-bench", "summary": "We introduce Cube Bench, a Rubik's-cube benchmark for evaluating spatial and sequential reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking.

Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation.

We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation.

However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models.

Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\\leq95\\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images.

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal.

However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge.

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM.

However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits.

While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME).

Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes.

This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes.

To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models.

However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization.

However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations.

To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability.

However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum.

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process.

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail.

They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis.

At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning.

However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.\n  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.\n  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.\n  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability.

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDETACH\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2-\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u9002\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u62c5\u5fe7\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u867d\u5177\u6709\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDETACH\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u805a\u7c7b\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5efa\u7acb\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u7b80\u5355\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u56f0\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u5728Opportunity++\u548cHWU-USP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDETACH\u76f8\u6bd4\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0-\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3-\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "DETACH\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5916\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cftransition\u6837\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u5185\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u7684transition\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u88ab\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30episode\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u6298\u6263\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97transition\u7684\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u5f97\u5206\u7684transition\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709transition\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTBSD\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5e73\u6ed1\u80cc\u666f\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u5b66\u4e60\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "method": "\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a1)\u5b66\u4e60\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u5468\u671f\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2)\u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u57fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "TBSD\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027"}}

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa NeuralCrop \u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u578b\uff08GGCMs\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u53d8\u5316\u6c14\u5019\u6761\u4ef6\u4f5c\u7269\u4ea7\u91cf\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "NeuralCrop \u9996\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u7ade\u4e89\u6027 GGCM \u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u89e3\u6790\u91cd\u8981\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "NeuralCrop \u5728\u573a\u5730\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u79cd\u690d\u533a\u57df\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb GGCMs\u30022000-2019 \u5e74\u95f4\uff0cNeuralCrop \u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u5c0f\u9ea6\u533a\u548c\u7f8e\u56fd\u7389\u7c73\u5e26\u5e74\u9645\u4ea7\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5e72\u65f1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u5c24\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u6761\u4ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6df7\u5408\u4f5c\u7269\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4f5c\u7269\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u589e\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4ea7\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness.

While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch.

This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u8fd0\u884c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u503c\u9690\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5b9e\u4f53\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.\n  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.\n  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.\n  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.\n  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.\n  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.\n  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e30\u5bcc\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u4e3a\u4e94\u7ae0\uff0c\u6bcf\u7ae0\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u51fa\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e09\u7ae0\u4ecb\u7ecdSpatial-Reasoning Bert\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3a2D\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u7b2c\u56db\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u672f\u8bed\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u73b0\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u89e3\u5256\u56fe\u8c31\u76843D\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e94\u7ae0\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u8c13\u8bcd\uff1b\u7b2c\u516d\u7ae0\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e03\u7ae0\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7fRGB\u6a21\u578b\u6a21\u4eff\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aSpatial-Reasoning Bert\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u7801\uff1b\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u7684\u53ef\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff1b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6280\u672f\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8d21\u732e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u672c\u89e3\u8bfb\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u878d\u5408\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory.

First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose.

However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior.

We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.\n  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.\n  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.

Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC.

Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks.

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling.

ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios.

The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive \"thinking\" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $\u03b1$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Simply replacing shared normalization with task-specific variants already yields competitive performance, questioning the need for complex designs. Building on this insight, we propose Task-Specific Sigmoid Batch Normalization (TS$\u03c3$BN), a lightweight mechanism that enables tasks to softly allocate network capacity while fully sharing feature extractors.

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them.

Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails.

Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
