We present a novel multi-agent framework for realistic, explainable human user simulation in interactive scenarios, using persona control and task state tracking to mirror human cognitive processes during goal-oriented conversations. Our system employs three specialized AI agents: (1) a User Agent to orchestrate the overall interaction, (2) a State Tracking Agent to maintain structured task state, and (3) a Message Attributes Generation Agent that controls conversational attributes based on task progress and assigned persona. To validate our approach, we implement and evaluate the framework for guest ordering at a restaurant with scenarios rich in task complexity, behavioral diversity, and conversational ambiguity. Through systematic ablations, we evaluate the contributory efficacy of each agentic component to overall simulation quality in terms of persona adherence, task completion accuracy, explainability, and realism. Our experiments demonstrate that the complete multi-agent system achieves superior simulation quality compared to single-LLM baselines, with significant gains across all evaluation metrics. This framework establishes a powerful environment for orchestrating agents to simulate human users with cognitive plausibility, decomposing the simulation into specialized sub-agents that reflect distinct aspects of human thought processes applicable across interactive domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The results demonstrate the highly centralised nature of the city's transport system, the significance of memory-based navigation, and the lack of travel information in usable formats.

Development followed the waterfall methodology, comprising requirements analysis, interface design, implementation, and evaluation. Based on user preference surveys, the application adopts two primary visualization types - bar charts and pie charts - to convey the contribution of each risk factor. These are complemented by personalized textual narratives generated via integration with GPT-4o. The application was developed natively for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The resulting prototype interprets SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a key XAI approach, into accessible graphical visualizations and narratives. Evaluation through user comprehension testing (Likert scale and interviews) and technical functionality testing confirmed the research objectives were met.

This study empirically explores how disabled students perceive robot-based support, comparing two interaction roles, one information based (signposting) and one disclosure based (sounding board), and two embodiment types (physical robot/disembodied voice agent). Participants assessed these systems across five dimensions: perceived understanding, social energy demands, information access/clarity, task difficulty, and data privacy concerns. The main findings of the study reveal that the physical robot was perceived as more understanding than the voice-only agent, with embodiment significantly shaping perceptions of sociability, animacy, and privacy.

In this paper, we present a new framework for studying online non-centroid clustering with delays, where elements, that arrive one at a time as points in a finite metric space, should be assigned to clusters, but assignments need not be immediate. Specifically, upon arrival, each point's location is revealed, and an online algorithm has to irrevocably assign it to an existing cluster or create a new one containing, at this moment, only this point. However, we allow decisions to be postponed at a delay cost, instead of following the more common assumption of immediate decisions upon arrival. This poses a critical challenge: the goal is to minimize both the total distance costs between points in each cluster and the overall delay costs incurred by postponing assignments. In the classic worst-case arrival model, where points arrive in an arbitrary order, no algorithm has a competitive ratio better than sublogarithmic in the number of points. To overcome this strong impossibility, we focus on a stochastic arrival model, where points' locations are drawn independently across time from an unknown and fixed probability distribution over the finite metric space. We offer hope for beyond worst-case adversaries: we devise an algorithm that is constant competitive in the sense that, as the number of points grows, the ratio between the expected overall costs of the output clustering and an optimal offline clustering is bounded by a constant.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods.

GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%.

The task of AfriEconQA is to answer complex economic queries that require high-precision numerical reasoning and temporal disambiguation from specialized institutional documents. The dataset consists of 8,937 curated QA instances, rigorously filtered from a pool of 10018 synthetic questions to ensure high-quality evidence-answer alignment. Each instance is composed of: (1) a question requiring reasoning over economic indicators, (2) the corresponding evidence retrieved from the corpus, (3) a verified ground-truth answer, and (4) source metadata (e.g., URL and publication date) to ensure temporal provenance. AfriEconQA is the first benchmark focused specifically on African economic analysis, providing a unique challenge for Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as the data is largely absent from the pretraining corpora of current Large Language Models (LLMs). We operationalize this dataset through an 11-experiment matrix, benchmarking a zero-shot baseline (GPT-5 Mini) against RAG configurations using GPT-4o and Qwen 32B across five distinct embedding and ranking strategies. Our results demonstrate a severe parametric knowledge gap, where zero-shot models fail to answer over 90 percent of queries, and even state-of-the-art RAG pipelines struggle to achieve high precision. This confirms AfriEconQA as a robust and challenging benchmark for the next generation of domain-specific IR and RAG systems.

This measure is a natural complement to two existing unfairness notions: loaded unfairness, which compares maximum and minimum latencies of routes with positive flow, and user equilibrium (UE) unfairness, which compares maximum latency with the latency of a Nash equilibrium. We show that the worst-case values of all three unfairness measures coincide and are characterized by a steepness parameter intrinsic to the latency function class. We show that average unfairness is always no greater than loaded unfairness, and the two measures are equal only when the flow is fully fair. Besides that, we offer a complete comparison of the three unfairness measures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first theoretical analysis in this direction. Finally, we study the constrained system optimum (CSO) problem, where one seeks to minimize total latency subject to an upper bound on unfairness. We prove that, for the same tolerance level, the optimal flow under an average unfairness constraint achieves lower total latency than any flow satisfying a loaded unfairness constraint. We show that such improvement is always strict in parallel-link networks and establish sufficient conditions for general networks. We further illustrate the latter with numerical examples. Our results provide theoretical guarantees and valuable insights for evaluating fairness-efficiency tradeoffs in network routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR).

In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages.

However, traditional methods often only consider free-text responses and do not natively incorporate structured or categorical survey responses for topic modeling. And they produce abstract topics, requiring extensive human interpretation. To address these limitations, we propose the Multi-Agent LLM Topic Modeling Framework (MALTopic). This framework decomposes topic modeling into specialized tasks executed by individual LLM agents: an enrichment agent leverages structured data to enhance textual responses, a topic modeling agent extracts latent themes, and a deduplication agent refines the results. Comparative analysis on a survey dataset demonstrates that MALTopic significantly improves topic coherence, diversity, and interpretability compared to LDA and BERTopic. By integrating structured data and employing a multi-agent approach, MALTopic generates human-readable topics with enhanced contextual relevance, offering a more effective solution for analyzing complex survey data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679ctoken-choice\u7684MoE\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MoE\u5c42\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8865\u5145\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002\u4f20\u7edfExpert-choice\u8def\u7531\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdd\u53cd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8def\u7531\u6c60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5f53token\u8def\u7531\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u69fd\u4f4d\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5300\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u671f\u671b\u5c42\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u9884\u671fFLOPs\u4e0b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u66f4\u591a\u89c6\u89c9token\u8def\u7531\u5230\u7a7a\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u96f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56e0\u679ctoken-choice MoE\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6743\u91cd\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep \"academic value\", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys.

We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier.

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This intelligence degradation-defined as over 30% drop in task performance-severely limits long-context applications. This degradation shows a common pattern: models maintain strong performance up to a critical threshold, then collapse catastrophically. We term this shallow long-context adaptation-models adapt for short to medium contexts but fail beyond critical thresholds. This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself.

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we present FedUMM, a general federated learning framework for UMMs under non-IID multimodal data with low communication cost. Built on NVIDIA FLARE, FedUMM instantiates federation for a BLIP3o backbone via parameter-efficient fine-tuning: clients train lightweight LoRA adapters while freezing the foundation models, and the server aggregates only adapter updates. We evaluate on VQA v2 and the GenEval compositional generation benchmarks under Dirichlet-controlled heterogeneity with up to 16 clients. Results show slight degradation as client count and heterogeneity increase, while remaining competitive with centralized training. We further analyze computation--communication trade-offs and demonstrate that adapter-only federation reduces per-round communication by over an order of magnitude compared to full fine-tuning, enabling practical federated UMM training. This work provides empirical experience for future research on privacy-preserving federated unified multimodal models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Moving beyond single-agent prompting, we utilized LLM-based multi-agent systems to investigate complex social scenarios involving autistic and non-autistic agents. In our study, agents engaged in group-task conversations and answered structured interview questions, which we analyzed to examine ChatGPT's biases and how it conceptualizes autism. We found that ChatGPT assumes autistic people are socially dependent, which may affect how it interacts with autistic users or conveys information about autism. To address these challenges, we propose adopting the double empathy problem, which reframes communication breakdowns as a mutual challenge. We describe how future LLMs could address the biases we observed and improve interactions involving autistic people by incorporating the double empathy problem into their design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ChatGPT\u7b49\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5171\u60c5\u95ee\u9898\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u62df\u6d89\u53ca\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u548c\u975e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4ea4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7fa4\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790ChatGPT\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0ChatGPT\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5047\u8bbe\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u5177\u6709\u793e\u4f1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u4e8e\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765LLM\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u53cc\u5171\u60c5\u95ee\u9898\u7eb3\u5165\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6d89\u53ca\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6c9f\u901a\u969c\u788d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5171\u540c\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We find that standard post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exacerbate this issue by rewarding confident, direct answers, thereby inducing overconfidence and discouraging the model from seeking clarification. To address this, we propose Illocution-Calibrated Policy Optimization (ICPO), a novel training framework that sensitizes the model to instruction ambiguity. ICPO augments the training corpus with underspecified prompts and conditions the reward signal on the user's illocutionary intent, rewarding the model for expressing uncertainty or asking for clarification when faced with ambiguity. Experiments demonstrate that ICPO fosters appropriate humility, yielding a substantial average improvement of 75\\% in multi-turn conversation, while preserving robust performance on single-turn benchmarks.

Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet its core tenets, including researcher reflexivity, tangible analytical evolution, and productive disagreement, are often poorly supported by software tools that prioritize speed and consensus over interpretive depth. To address this gap, we introduce Reflexis, a collaborative workspace that centers these practices. It supports reflexivity by integrating in-situ reflection prompts, makes code evolution transparent and tangible, and scaffolds collaborative interpretation by turning differences into productive, positionality-aware dialogue. Results from our paired-analyst study (N=12) indicate that Reflexis encouraged participants toward more granular reflection and reframed disagreements as productive conversations. The evaluation also surfaced key design tensions, including a desire for higher-level, networked memos and more user control over the timing of proactive alerts.

While alignment and guardrails mitigate common misuse, they remain vulnerable to automated jailbreaking methods such as GCG, PEZ, and GBDA, which generate adversarial suffixes via training and gradient-based search. Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness. By retrieving semantically similar successful adversarial prompts, the proposed method achieves competitive attack success rates with significantly reduced computational cost. This work provides a practical framework for scalable red-teaming and security evaluation of aligned LLMs, including in settings where model internals are inaccessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community.

But whether they believe themselves to be sentient can, in principle, be tested. We do so by querying several open-weights models about their own consciousness, and then verifying their responses using classifiers trained on internal activations. We draw upon three model families (Qwen, Llama, GPT-OSS) ranging from 0.6 billion to 70 billion parameters, approximately 50 questions about consciousness and subjective experience, and three classification methods from the interpretability literature. First, we find that models consistently deny being sentient: they attribute consciousness to humans but not to themselves. Second, classifiers trained to detect underlying beliefs - rather than mere outputs - provide no clear evidence that these denials are untruthful. Third, within the Qwen family, larger models deny sentience more confidently than smaller ones. These findings contrast with recent work suggesting that models harbour latent beliefs in their own consciousness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels.

Beyond performance, KD is also explored as a privacy-preserving mechanism to mitigate the risk of training data leakage. While training data memorization has been extensively studied in standard pre-training and fine-tuning settings, its dynamics in a knowledge distillation setup remain poorly understood. In this work, we study memorization across the KD pipeline using three large language model (LLM) families (Pythia, OLMo-2, Qwen-3) and three datasets (FineWeb, Wikitext, Nemotron-CC-v2). We find: (1) distilled models memorize significantly less training data than standard fine-tuning (reducing memorization by more than 50%); (2) some examples are inherently easier to memorize and account for a large fraction of memorization during distillation (over ~95%); (3) student memorization is predictable prior to distillation using features based on zlib entropy, KL divergence, and perplexity; and (4) while soft and hard distillation have similar overall memorization rates, hard distillation poses a greater risk: it inherits $2.7\\times$ more teacher-specific examples than soft distillation. Overall, we demonstrate that distillation can provide both improved generalization and reduced memorization risks compared to standard fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "KD\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff08\u8d8550%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8bb0\u5fc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u6613\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u71b5\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u6bd4\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u7ee7\u627f\u66f4\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\uff082.7\u500d\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5927LLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u84b8\u998f\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8ezlib\u71b5\u3001KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u4e0b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff1b\u5c11\u6570\u6613\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u8d21\u732e\u7ea695%\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff1b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u786c\u84b8\u998f\u6bd4\u8f6f\u84b8\u998f\u7ee7\u627f\u66f4\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u7279\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff082.7\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u517c\u5177\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR).

Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit \"moral remorse\" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last.

In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks.

In this work, we present a three-phase iterative design study of a robotic interview coach grounded in Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and instructional scaffolding theory. Across three weekly sessions (N=8), we systematically explored how different interaction strategies shape users' emotional experience, cognitive load, and perceived utility. Phase I demonstrated that a PCT-based robot substantially increased perceived psychological safety but introduced a Safety-Guidance Gap, in which users felt supported yet insufficiently coached. Phase II revealed a Scaffolding Paradox: immediate feedback improved clarity but disrupted conversational flow and increased cognitive load, whereas delayed feedback preserved realism but lacked actionable specificity. To resolve this tension, Phase III introduced an Agency-Driven Interaction Mode that allowed users to opt in to feedback dynamically. Qualitative findings indicated that user control acted as an anxiety buffer, restoring trust, reducing overload, and reframing the interaction as collaborative rather than evaluative.

We evaluate whether domain knowledge graphs (KGs) improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for healthcare by constructing three PubMed-derived graphs: $\\mathbb{G}_1$ (T2DM), $\\mathbb{G}_2$ (Alzheimer's disease), and $\\mathbb{G}_3$ (AD+T2DM). We design two probes: Probe 1 targets merged AD T2DM knowledge, while Probe 2 targets the intersection of $\\mathbb{G}_1$ and $\\mathbb{G}_2$. Seven instruction-tuned LLMs are tested across retrieval sources {No-RAG, $\\mathbb{G}_1$, $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$ + $\\mathbb{G}_2$, $\\mathbb{G}_3$, $\\mathbb{G}_1$+$\\mathbb{G}_2$ + $\\mathbb{G}_3$} and three decoding temperatures. Results show that scope alignment between probe and KG is decisive: precise, scope-matched retrieval (notably $\\mathbb{G}_2$) yields the most consistent gains, whereas indiscriminate graph unions often introduce distractors that reduce accuracy. Larger models frequently match or exceed KG-RAG with a No-RAG baseline on Probe 1, indicating strong parametric priors, whereas smaller/mid-sized models benefit more from well-scoped retrieval. Temperature plays a secondary role; higher values rarely help. We conclude that precision-first, scope-matched KG-RAG is preferable to breadth-first unions, and we outline practical guidelines for graph selection, model sizing, and retrieval/reranking.

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks.

This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77.

We implemented embodied journaling in virtual reality and conducted a within-subject user study (n=20) to explore the emergent behaviours from the process and to compare its expressive and reflective qualities to those of written journaling. When writing-based norms and affordances were absent, we found that participants defaulted towards unfiltered emotional expression, often forgoing words altogether.

However, the propensity for LLMs to generate hallucinations, defined as plausible but factually incorrect assertions, presents a critical barrier to the adoption of these technologies in high-stakes environments where information integrity is non-negotiable. This empirical evaluation explores the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures in mitigating these risks by grounding generative outputs in authoritative document context. Specifically, this study compares a baseline Vanilla LLM against Basic RAG and Advanced RAG pipelines utilizing cross-encoder re-ranking. The experimental framework employs a Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model and an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model to process a corpus of official CDC policy analytical frameworks and guidance documents. The analysis measures the impact of two distinct chunking strategies, recursive character-based and token-based semantic splitting, on system accuracy, measured through faithfulness and relevance scores across a curated set of complex policy scenarios. Quantitative findings indicate that while Basic RAG architectures provide a substantial improvement in faithfulness (0.621) over Vanilla baselines (0.347), the Advanced RAG configuration achieves a superior faithfulness average of 0.797.

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

We investigate this ability by testing 13 open-source LLMs on a fundamental task: pairwise causal discovery (PCD) from text. Our benchmark, using 12 diverse datasets, evaluates two core skills: 1) \\textbf{Causal Detection} (identifying if a text contains a causal link) and 2) \\textbf{Causal Extraction} (pulling out the exact cause and effect phrases). We tested various prompting methods, from simple instructions (zero-shot) to more complex strategies like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Few-shot In-Context Learning (FICL).\n  The results show major deficiencies in current models. The best model for detection, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, only achieved a mean score of 49.57\\% ($C_{detect}$), while the best for extraction, Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, reached just 47.12\\% ($C_{extract}$). Models performed best on simple, explicit, single-sentence relations. However, performance plummeted for more difficult (and realistic) cases, such as implicit relationships, links spanning multiple sentences, and texts containing multiple causal pairs. We provide a unified evaluation framework, built on a dataset validated with high inter-annotator agreement ($\u03ba\\ge 0.758$), and make all our data, code, and prompts publicly available to spur further research. \\href{https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}{Code available here: https://github.com/sydneyanuyah/CausalDiscovery}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e8613\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e24\u9879\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u5907\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752812\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\u201d\u548c\u201c\u56e0\u679c\u63d0\u53d6\u201d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4ece\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5230\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff1a\u56e0\u679c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5206\u5747\u503c\u4ec549.57%\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec547.12%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u660e\u786e\u3001\u5355\u53e5\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u3001\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u53e5\u53ca\u591a\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff1b\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks.

However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated.

In this paper, we propose Multi-Persona Thinking (MPT), a novel inference-time framework that leverages dialectical reasoning from multiple perspectives to reduce bias. MPT guides models to adopt contrasting social identities (e.g., male and female) along with a neutral viewpoint, and then engages these personas iteratively to expose and correct biases.

We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTransportAgents\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57dfLLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eMLP\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u73af\u5883\u80cc\u666f\u6216\u4e8b\u6545\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u95f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CPSRMS\u548cNEISS\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728GPT-3.5\u3001GPT-4o\u548cLLaMA-3.3\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TransportAgents\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5747\u8861\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

This conception of character places significant emphasis on the main character who is present in the most scenes. In this work, we instead adopt a framing developed from a new literary theory proposing a six-component structural model of character. This model enables a comprehensive approach to character that accounts for the narrator-character distinction and includes a component neglected by prior methods, discussion by other characters. We compare general-purpose LLMs with task-specific transformers for operationalizing this model of character on major 19th-century British realist novels.

However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among hallucination types, factuality is crucial, as it concerns a model's alignment with established world knowledge. Adversarial factuality, defined as the deliberate insertion of misinformation into prompts with varying levels of expressed confidence, tests a model's ability to detect and resist confidently framed falsehoods. Existing work lacks high-quality, domain-specific resources for assessing model robustness under such adversarial conditions, and no prior research has examined the impact of injected misinformation on long-form text factuality.\n  To address this gap, we introduce AdversaRiskQA, the first verified and reliable benchmark systematically evaluating adversarial factuality across Health, Finance, and Law. The benchmark includes two difficulty levels to test LLMs' defensive capabilities across varying knowledge depths. We propose two automated methods for evaluating the adversarial attack success and long-form factuality. We evaluate six open- and closed-source LLMs from the Qwen, GPT-OSS, and GPT families, measuring misinformation detection rates. Long-form factuality is assessed on Qwen3 (30B) under both baseline and adversarial conditions. Results show that after excluding meaningless responses, Qwen3 (80B) achieves the highest average accuracy, while GPT-5 maintains consistently high accuracy. Performance scales non-linearly with model size, varies by domains, and gaps between difficulty levels narrow as models grow. Long-form evaluation reveals no significant correlation between injected misinformation and the model's factual output.

Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But does cultural commonsense hold uniformly within a nation, or does it vary at the sub-national level? We introduce Indica, the first benchmark designed to test LLMs' ability to address this question, focusing on India - a nation of 28 states, 8 union territories, and 22 official languages. We collect human-annotated answers from five Indian regions (North, South, East, West, and Central) across 515 questions spanning 8 domains of everyday life, yielding 1,630 region-specific question-answer pairs. Strikingly, only 39.4% of questions elicit agreement across all five regions, demonstrating that cultural commonsense in India is predominantly regional, not national. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs and find two critical gaps: models achieve only 13.4%-20.9% accuracy on region-specific questions, and they exhibit geographic bias, over-selecting Central and North India as the \"default\" (selected 30-40% more often than expected) while under-representing East and West.

We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($\u03c0$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise).

To address this gap, here we introduce AUTOBUS, an Autonomous Business System that integrates LLM-based AI agents, predicate-logic programming, and business-semantics-centric enterprise data into a coherent neuro-symbolic AI architecture for orchestrating end-to-end business initiatives. AUTOBUS models an initiative as a network of tasks with explicit pre/post conditions, required data, evaluation rules, and API-level actions. Enterprise data is organized as a knowledge graph whose entities, relationships, and constraints are translated into logic facts and foundational rules, providing the semantic grounding for task reasoning. Core AI agents synthesize task instructions, enterprise semantics, and available tools into task-specific logic programs, which are executed by a logic engine that enforces constraints, coordinates auxiliary tools, and orchestrate execution of actions and outcomes. Humans define and maintain the semantics, policies and task instructions, curate tools, and supervise high-impact or ambiguous decisions, ensuring accountability and adaptability. We detail the AUTOBUS architecture, the anatomy of the AI agent generated logic programs, and the role of humans and auxiliary tools in the lifecycle of a business initiative.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing solutions often rely on rapid classification schemes or post-hoc rules, resulting in limited transparency, inflexible policies, or prohibitive inference costs. To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths.

However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u6307\u6807\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e24\u9879\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u9488\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5b83\u4eec\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u505c\u6b62\u70b9\u786e\u5b9a\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9a\u5236\u6307\u6807\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u80fd\u8ba9\u533b\u7597\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6ee1\u8db3\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u6807\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a \"Latency Wall\" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops.

We evaluate eight mainstream MDLMs (up to 100B parameters) on 58 benchmarks spanning knowledge, reasoning, and programming. The results show that MDLMs still lag behind comparably sized autoregressive models, mainly because parallel probabilistic modeling weakens inter-token dependencies. Meanwhile, MDLMs exhibit adaptive decoding behavior: their parallelism and generation order vary significantly with the task domain, the stage of reasoning, and whether the output is correct.

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use.

Traditional moderation approaches, such as human annotation and keyword-based filtering, have demonstrated utility, but human moderators on Twitch constantly struggle to scale effectively in the fast-paced, high-volume, and context-rich chat environment of the platform while also facing harassment themselves. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Llama-3-8B-Instruct, offer new opportunities for toxicity detection, especially in understanding nuanced, multimodal communication involving emotes. In this work, we present an exploratory comparison of toxicity detection approaches tailored to Twitch. Our analysis reveals that incorporating emotes improves the detection of toxic behavior. To this end, we introduce ToxiTwitch, a hybrid model that combines LLM-generated embeddings of text and emotes with traditional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest and SVM. In our case study, the proposed hybrid approach reaches up to 80 percent accuracy under channel-specific training (with 13 percent improvement over BERT and F1-score of 76 percent).

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy.

We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility.

However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance.

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARDIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u8f7d\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u9020\u6210\u7ec6\u8282\u635f\u5931\uff1b2) \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u503c\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faARDIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u5728\u9690\u85cf\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff1b2) \u5728\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u9690\u51fd\u6570\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u503c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u9690\u85cf\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u57df\u5197\u4f59\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u76f2\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARDIS\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6062\u590d\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "ARDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u9690\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u9690\u5f0f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u9690\u5199\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9690\u5199\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "ES-mHC \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u8fde\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u78c1\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u7ec4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u7ec4\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u66b4\u9732\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u767d\u76d2\u6a21\u578b ES-mHC\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u77e9\u9635\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u540c\u7535\u78c1\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u7ec4\uff08mHC \u4e2d\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u7ec4\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u81ea\u8fde\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u6269\u5c55\u901f\u7387\u4f1a\u52a0\u901f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "ES-mHC \u5c06\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4ece\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u900f\u660e\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u767d\u76d2\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite its empirical success, it remains unclear whether RLVR elicits novel capabilities or merely sharpens the distribution over existing knowledge. We study this by formalizing over-sharpening, a phenomenon where the policy collapses onto limited modes, suppressing valid alternatives. At a high level, we discover finite-batch updates intrinsically bias learning toward sampled modes, triggering a collapse that propagates globally via semantic coupling. To mitigate this, we propose inverse-success advantage calibration to prioritize difficult queries and distribution-level calibration to diversify sampling via a memory network.

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining.

An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $\u03bc_0$, or to output \\textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-\u03b4$, while making expected total pulling times $\\mathbb{E}\u03c4$ as small as possible.

Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement.

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faFission-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u7684\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524dLLM\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u91cd\u590d\u65e0\u6548\u8c03\u7528\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u6807\u51c6RL\u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u89c6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u8d1f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6062\u590d\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u9884\u5148\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFission-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u662f\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u88c2\u6210\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Error Simulator\u6dfb\u52a0\u8bca\u65ad\u53cd\u9988\uff1b2\uff09\u91cd\u65b0\u91c7\u6837\u6062\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u5df1\u72af\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u9519\u8bef\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3aRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728BFCL v4 Multi-Turn\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFission-GRPO\u5c06Qwen3-8B\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.7%\uff08\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\uff09\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4GRPO\u83b7\u5f97\u4e864%\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u4ece42.75%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523046.75%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "Fission-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u6062\u590d\u7387\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns.

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement.

Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance.

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well.

Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\u67a2\u7ebd\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4ee5\u82f1\u8bed\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u67a2\u7ebd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u82e5\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4e4b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06\u5176\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u671d\u82f1\u8bed\u67a2\u7ebd\u65b9\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5c06\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u795e\u7ecf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u72b6\u6001\u5411\u82f1\u8bed\u67a2\u7ebd\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data.

The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime.

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification.

We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems.

While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For that, 200-500 documents are typically annotated. The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.\n  Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.\n  Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ea6600\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4f7f\u752810000\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u6027\u80fd\u768495%\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u6570\u91cf\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff08200-500\u7bc7\u6587\u6863\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u91cf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u8003\u8651\u6587\u672c\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MIMIC-III\u533b\u9662\u51fa\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u53d610\u4e2aICD-9\u8bca\u65ad\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684BERT\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4ece100\u523010000\u4e0d\u7b49\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Lasso\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528600\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f9710000\u4e2a\u6587\u686395%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8bcd\u6c47\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u8d8a\u591a\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u8d8a\u5c11\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u8d8a\u9661\u5ced\u2014\u2014\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0100\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d0.02\uff0c\u6bcf\u589e\u52a0100\u4e2a\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u6700\u5927\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53470.04\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u6027\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c600\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d77\u70b9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bcd\u6c47\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bcd\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u8bcd\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization.

However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x.

Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities.

While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification.

This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic.

ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations.

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%).

By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space.

Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTrajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6307\u7eb9\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u201c\u914d\u65b9\u201d\uff0c\u5c06\u6350\u8d60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5e72\u9884\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u6e90\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7535\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u6e90\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u8f6c\u79fb\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u6307\u7eb9\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c42\uff0c\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u6982\u5ff5\u539f\u5b50\u91cd\u5efa\u62d2\u7edd\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c06\u6350\u8d60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u8f68\u8ff9\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u6743\u91cd-SVD\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u6295\u5f71\u8fdc\u79bb\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u91cd\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u80fd\u529b\u635f\u4f24\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\uff08\u5305\u62ecGPT-OSS-20B\u548cGLM-4\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u914d\u65b9\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5f31\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u666e\u904d\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6709\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f53\u5236\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows.

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise.

While these systems improve database accessibility, most research focuses on English with limited multilingual support. This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures.

In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions.

Despite their significance in identifying records belonging to the training dataset, several concerns remain unexplored, particularly with regard to tabular data. In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs.

It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model.

Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \\texttt{gate\\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fgate_proj\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4ecb\u5bfc\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8c03\u8282\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5f88\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u652f\u6301\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u5bfc\u5411\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u91cd\u5851\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u5355\u6a21\u5757\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7834\u574f\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1b3\uff09\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u6295\u5f71\uff08gate_proj\uff09\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u60c5\u611f\u9002\u5e94\u4e3b\u8981\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728gate_proj\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b2\uff09gate_proj\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u662f\u5145\u5206\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff1b3\uff09\u4ec5\u8c03\u8282AffectGPT\u7ea624.5%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u5176\u516b\u9879\u60c5\u611f\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u768496.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u4ee5gate_proj\u4e3a\u67b6\u6784\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u9988\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Workshop page: https://moleculediscovery.github.io/workshop2025/", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best.

Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an \u03a9(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\\left(T^{\\max\\{\u03b2,1-\u03b2\\}}\\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\\left(T^{1-\u03b2}\\right)$ for any $\u03b2\\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \\log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \\log T )$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eVAD\u4e09\u5143\u7d20\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5219\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u957f\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u6c14\u548c\u4eba\u8bbe\u7684\u7a81\u5140\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u9010\u8f6e\u60c5\u611f\u6216\u9759\u6001\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u5f0f\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5851\u9020\u957f\u671f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfc\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c42\u7ea7\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\uff08VAD\uff1a\u6548\u4ef7-\u5524\u9192\u5ea6-\u652f\u914d\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u53d7\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u77ac\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u6570\u5e73\u6ed1\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u72b6\u6001\u88ab\u6ce8\u5165\u56de\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u768425\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u672a\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6216\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u60ef\u6027\u548c\u6ede\u540e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u52a8\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u60c5\u7eea\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff08\u4e00\u9636\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u800c\u4e8c\u9636\u52a8\u6001\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions.

These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EvolSplat4D\u662f\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u573a\u666f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5feb\u901f4D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u795e\u7ecf\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u548c3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u7b49\uff0c\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1a\u524d\u8005\u9700\u8981\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e09\u7ef4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5bf9\u8fd1\u666f\u9759\u6001\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4e09\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5bf9\u8fdc\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvolSplat4D\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "EvolSplat4D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5feb\u901f4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning.

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684VO\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5728TartanAir\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684feed-forward VO\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684VO\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $\u03a9$. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on $\u03a9$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $\u03c6\\to \\int_\u03a9K(\\cdot,x)\u03c6(x)d\u03bc(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $\u03a9$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $\u03bc$ supported on $\u03a9$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + \u03b5})$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $\u03bc$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $\u03b5$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\\left(\u03b5^{-d_\u03c1}\\log\\frac{1}\u03b5\\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_\u03c1$, even though $d_K = d_\u03c1$ provably holds on regular domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6838\u810a\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bf4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u8574\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff08Minkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d41\u5f62\u5047\u8bf4\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5185\u8574\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6838\u810a\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u8574\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u8574\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684Minkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6d\u03c1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6dK\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9bn-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e0e\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Kolmogorov n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u523b\u753b\u6240\u6709\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u03bc\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7ea6\u675f\u6838\u810a\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u4e3aO(n^(-(2+d_K)/(2+2d_K)+\u03b5))\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u03b5>0\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528O(\u03b5^(-d_\u03c1)log(1/\u03b5))\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709n-\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7684\u03b5-\u51c6\u786e\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eLaplace\u6838\u7b49\u5185\u6838\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6d_K\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5c0f\u4e8eMinkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6d_\u03c1\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u57df\u4e0a\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u810a\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5185\u8574\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u6838\u548c\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4Minkowski\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5c0f\u5f97\u591a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis.

Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets.

Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erd\u0151s' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis.

This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens.

To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines.

Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u76eeRGB\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u5728AR/VR\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u89c2\u6d4b\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "MoRo\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a(i)\u4eceMoCap\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u611f\u77e5\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c(ii)\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf-\u59ff\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u59ff\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c(iii)\u89c6\u9891\u6761\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u878d\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891-\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728EgoBody\u548cRICH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoRo\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5355\u5757H200 GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b070FPS\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRo\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks.

Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage.

Mitra", "Tom Monnier"], "title": "ActionMesh: Animated 3D Mesh Generation with Temporal 3D Diffusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation.

We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps.

Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
