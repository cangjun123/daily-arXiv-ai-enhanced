R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit (1937) using computational text analysis. Dialogue was extracted with regular expressions, then preprocessed, and scored using the NRC-VAD lexicon to quantify emotional dimensions. The results show that the dialogue maintains a generally positive (high valence) and calm (low arousal) tone, with a gradually increasing sense of agency (dominance) as the story progresses. These patterns reflect the novel's emotional rhythm: moments of danger and excitement are regularly balanced by humor, camaraderie, and relief. Visualizations -- including emotional trajectory graphs and word clouds -- highlight how Tolkien's language cycles between tension and comfort. By combining computational tools with literary interpretation, this study demonstrates how digital methods can uncover subtle emotional structures in literature, revealing the steady rhythm and emotional modulation that shape the storytelling in The Hobbit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As research increasingly leverages audio-visual materials to analyze the display of emotions, the emergence of multimodal generative AI promises great advances. However, we lack evidence about the effectiveness of multimodal AI in emotion analysis. This paper addresses this gap by evaluating current multimodal large language models (mLLMs) in video-based analysis of emotional arousal in two complementary data sets of human-labeled video recordings. I find that under ideal circumstances, mLLMs' emotional arousal ratings are highly reliable and show little to know indication of demographic bias. However, in recordings of speakers in real-world parliamentary debates, mLLMs' arousal ratings fail to deliver on this promise with potential negative consequences for downstream statistical inferences. This study therefore underscores the need for continued, thorough evaluation of emerging generative AI methods in political analysis and contributes a suitable replicable framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u8d77\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u60c5\u7eea\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5173\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u8d77\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f55\u5236\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb2\u8bdd\u8005\u5f55\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5524\u8d77\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8bae\u4f1a\u8fa9\u8bba\u5f55\u97f3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5524\u8d77\u8bc4\u5206\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6df1\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u5174\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5408\u9002\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time, which is incompatible with sequential interactions. In contrast, humans can listen, think, and act asynchronously: we begin thinking about the problem while reading it and continue thinking while formulating the answer. In this work, we augment LLMs capable of reasoning to operate in a similar way without additional training. Our method uses the properties of rotary embeddings to enable LLMs built for sequential interactions to simultaneously think, listen, and generate outputs. We evaluate our approach on math, commonsense, and safety reasoning and find that it can generate accurate thinking-augmented answers in real time, reducing time to first non-thinking token from minutes to <= 5s. and the overall real-time delays by 6-11x.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \\mathrm{erf}(\u03b1x + s)$, where $\\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A Progressive Investigation", "comment": "Code is released at https://github.com/Ivan-Tang-3D/3DGen-R1", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation.

Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\uff08\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u6848\u8bc4\u5ba1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u63d0\u4ea4\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u6848\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6392\u540d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u6a61\u6811\u5cad\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u65af\u6ce2\u83b1\u7533\u4e2d\u5b50\u6e90\u4e09\u4e2a\u5149\u675f\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u548c\u53d1\u8868\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6392\u540d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u66fc\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u03c1\u7ea60.2-0.8\uff0c\u79fb\u966410%\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u540e\u53ef\u8fbe\u22650.5\uff09\u3002LLMs\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u53d1\u8868\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5ba1\u8005\uff0c\u800c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002LLMs\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u6848\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u6848\u8bc4\u5ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u53d6\u4ee3\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects. A differentiable conjugate heat-transfer model is discretized and embedded into an end-to-end learning pipeline optimized using historical plant data from the 50 MW Andasol 3 solar field.\n  The model accurately reconstructs loop temperatures (RMSE $<2^\\circ$C) and produces physically meaningful estimates of loop imbalances and receiver heat losses.

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks. We evaluate our method on challenging, long-horizon offline goal-conditioned tasks and show that it reliably outperforms prior methods.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps. Ablations show DaSH is robust to low-resource settings and lack of relevant datasets, making it suitable for scalable and adaptive dataset selection in practical multi-source learning workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods. Following recent encouraging progress on NFs, we hope our work will draw further attention to this classical paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet there is still no comprehensive benchmark that holistically assesses the progress toward this goal. In this work, we introduce MMSI-Video-Bench, a fully human-annotated benchmark for video-based spatial intelligence in MLLMs. It operationalizes a four-level framework, Perception, Planning, Prediction, and Cross-Video Reasoning, through 1,106 questions grounded in 1,278 clips from 25 datasets and in-house videos. Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

We introduce BabyVLM-V2, a developmentally grounded framework for infant-inspired vision-language modeling that extensively improves upon BabyVLM-V1 through a longitudinal, multifaceted pretraining set, a versatile model, and, most importantly, DevCV Toolbox for cognitive evaluation. The pretraining set maximizes coverage while minimizing curation of a longitudinal, infant-centric audiovisual corpus, yielding video-utterance, image-utterance, and multi-turn conversational data that mirror infant experiences. DevCV Toolbox adapts all vision-related measures of the recently released NIH Baby Toolbox into a benchmark suite of ten multimodal tasks, covering spatial reasoning, memory, and vocabulary understanding aligned with early children's capabilities. Experimental results show that a compact model pretrained from scratch can achieve competitive performance on DevCV Toolbox, outperforming GPT-4o on some tasks.

Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can process additional modalities and sensors such as RGB-D frames, IMU-based egomotion, and Radar Doppler measurements, when available. One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates.

Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consistency tasks. Our method separately represents space, time, and view conditions, enabling flexible combinations of these inputs. For example, OmniView can synthesize novel views from static, dynamic, and multiview inputs, extrapolate trajectories forward and backward in time, and create videos from text or image prompts with full camera control. OmniView is competitive with task-specific models across diverse benchmarks and metrics, improving image quality scores among camera-conditioned diffusion models by up to 33\\% in multiview NVS LLFF dataset, 60\\% in dynamic NVS Neural 3D Video benchmark, 20\\% in static camera control on RE-10K, and reducing camera trajectory errors by 4x in text-conditioned video generation.

Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline. Adding to conversations around challenges in grounding textual and visual reasoning, Mull-Tokens offers a simple solution to abstractly think in multiple modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecdMull-Tokens\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728token\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u4ea4\u66ff\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u6216\u9ad8\u6602\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMull-Tokens\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728token\u6765\u627f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u81ea\u7531\u8f6c\u6362\uff1b2) \u501f\u9274\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff1b3) \u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u518d\u4ec5\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u57284\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u89e3\u8c1c\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0cMull-Tokens\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u4ea4\u9519\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347+3%\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u8c1c\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347+16%", "conclusion": "Mull-Tokens\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u601d\u7ef4\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b80\u5355\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728token\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and enhance it by leveraging image datasets and collected de-occlusion datasets for much more diverse open-set occlusion patterns. Then, we propose a unified pose estimation model that integrates global and local mechanisms for both self-attention and cross-attention to improve accuracy. Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model.
