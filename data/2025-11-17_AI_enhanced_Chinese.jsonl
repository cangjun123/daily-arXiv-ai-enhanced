While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faLT-Soups\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5934\u7c7b\u548c\u5c3e\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5934\u7c7b\u548c\u5c3e\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc6\u522b\u5934\u5c3e\u6bd4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u4e00\u6743\u8861\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LT-Soups\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5e73\u5747\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5934\u7c7b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5168\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5934\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7CIFAR100\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PEFT\u5728\u5c3e\u90e8\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5934\u91cd\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u5219\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "LT-Soups\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4PEFT\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u6c64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6743\u8861\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems.

However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Video and audio introduce an extended temporal dimension, resulting in a larger key-value (KV) cache compared to static image embedding. A naive optimization strategy is to selectively focus on and retain KV caches of audio or video based on task. However, in the experiment, we observed that the attention of AV-LLMs to various modalities in the high layers is not strictly dependent on the task. In higher layers, the attention of AV-LLMs shifts more towards the video modality. In addition, we also found that directly integrating temporal KV of audio and spatial-temporal KV of video may lead to information confusion and significant performance degradation of AV-LLMs. If audio and video are processed indiscriminately, it may also lead to excessive compression or reservation of a certain modality, thereby disrupting the alignment between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose AccKV, an Adaptive-Focusing and Cross-Calibration KV cache optimization framework designed specifically for efficient AV-LLMs inference. Our method is based on layer adaptive focusing technology, selectively focusing on key modalities according to the characteristics of different layers, and enhances the recognition of heavy hitter tokens through attention redistribution. In addition, we propose a Cross-Calibration technique that first integrates inefficient KV caches within the audio and video modalities, and then aligns low-priority modalities with high-priority modalities to selectively evict KV cache of low-priority modalities.

This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565HGC\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8df3\u8fc7\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1HGC\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u6210\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Traditional manual analysis approach is time-consuming and limited by human errors. To enhance efficiency and accuracy, large language models (LLMs) with strong analytical and inferencing capabilities can be employed. However, high-quality analysis reports with well-structured formatting cannot be obtained through a single instruction input to the LLM. To tackle this issue, we propose a method that first decomposes the complex task into several sub-tasks and designs effective system prompts and user prompts for each sub-task. Multi-round interactions with the LLM incorporating self-check and reflection are then conducted to enable structured data extraction as well as multi-step analysis and evaluation. Furthermore, custom tools are defined and invoked to generate figures and compute metrics. We also design multiple report templates, each tailored to a specific application and input data type, ensuring their adaptability across a variety of scenarios.

As these systems move toward real-world applications, their security becomes paramount. Existing research largely evaluates single-agent security, leaving a critical gap in understanding the vulnerabilities introduced by multi-agent design. However, existing systems fall short due to lack of unified frameworks and metrics focusing on unique rejection modes in MAS. We present SafeAgents, a unified and extensible framework for fine-grained security assessment of MAS. SafeAgents systematically exposes how design choices such as plan construction strategies, inter-agent context sharing, and fallback behaviors affect susceptibility to adversarial prompting. We introduce Dharma, a diagnostic measure that helps identify weak links within multi-agent pipelines. Using SafeAgents, we conduct a comprehensive study across five widely adopted multi-agent architectures (centralized, decentralized, and hybrid variants) on four datasets spanning web tasks, tool use, and code generation. Our findings reveal that common design patterns carry significant vulnerabilities. For example, centralized systems that delegate only atomic instructions to sub-agents obscure harmful objectives, reducing robustness. Our results highlight the need for security-aware design in MAS.

Our system transforms biographical data into 1,774 enriched first-person memories with affective-semantic metadata, then employs two-stage retrieval achieving 0.52s prompt generation. Evaluation using LLM-as-judge and RAGAs metrics shows our approach achieves parity with traditional RAG on GPT-4 while significantly outperforming it on smaller models (GPT-3.5, GPT-3), suggesting particular value for resource-constrained deployments. Beyond dialogue, the structured memory enables novel visualization tools: spatiotemporal heatmaps, emotional trajectory analysis, and interactive path tracking, positioning the system as both a dialogue interface and research tool for biographical analysis.

During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x.

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large.

Even when fine-grained controls are available, users are likely overwhelmed by the complexity of setting privacy preferences. This paper contributes to usable privacy management for TAPs by deriving privacy clusters and profiles for different types of users that can be semi-automatically assigned or suggested to them. We developed and validated a questionnaire, based on users' privacy concerns regarding confidentiality and control and their requirements towards transparency in TAPs.

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition.

It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

These modifications enhance graph fidelity while preserving the core spectral reasoning pipeline. Experimental results on ProofWriter, EntailmentBank, and CLUTRR benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains (up to +3.8\\%), improved generalization to adversarial cases, and reduced inference noise. The novelty lies in performing semantic and symbolic refinement entirely upstream of the spectral inference stage, enabling efficient, interpretable, and scalable reasoning without relying on quadratic attention mechanisms. In summary, this work extends the Spectral NSR framework with modular, semantically grounded preprocessing steps that improve graph quality without altering the core spectral reasoning engine.

While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies.

Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ans\u00e4tze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684ans\u00e4tze\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\uff0c\u5982\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\uff08RBF\uff09\u6838\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f97\u5f53\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6838\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u91cf\u5b50\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To further enhance reasoning and accuracy on complex tasks, Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising framework that engages multiple LLM agents in structured debates to encourage diverse reasoning. However, triggering MAD for every query is inefficient, as it incurs substantial computational (token) cost and may even degrade accuracy by overturning correct single-agent answers. To address these limitations, we propose intelligent Multi-Agent Debate (iMAD), a token-efficient framework that selectively triggers MAD only when it is likely to be beneficial (i.e., correcting an initially wrong answer). To achieve this goal, iMAD learns generalizable model behaviors to make accurate debate decisions. Specifically, iMAD first prompts a single agent to produce a structured self-critique response, from which we extract 41 interpretable linguistic and semantic features capturing hesitation cues. Then, iMAD uses a lightweight debate-decision classifier, trained using our proposed FocusCal loss, to determine whether to trigger MAD, enabling robust debate decisions without test dataset-specific tuning. Through extensive experiments using six (visual) question answering datasets against five competitive baselines, we have shown that iMAD significantly reduces token usage (by up to 92%) while also improving final answer accuracy (by up to 13.5%).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6iMAD\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfMAD\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "iMAD\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d641\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u51b3\u7b56\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1MAD\u3002", "result": "iMAD\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8692%\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a13.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "iMAD\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We first identify a patent-specific failure mode of SimCSE style dropout augmentation: it produces overly uniform embeddings that lose semantic cohesion. To remedy this, we propose section-based augmentation, where different sections of a patent (e.g., abstract, claims, background) serve as complementary views. This design introduces natural semantic and structural diversity, mitigating over-dispersion and yielding embeddings that better preserve both global structure and local continuity. On large-scale benchmarks, our fully self-supervised method matches or surpasses citation-and IPC-supervised baselines in prior-art retrieval and classification, while avoiding reliance on brittle or incomplete annotations.

However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines.

Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfaceBench is a new benchmark for symbolic surface discovery, focusing on diverse tasks and improving evaluation metrics for scientific equation discovery.", "motivation": "The need for improved symbolic regression techniques, particularly those that avoid reliance on memorized formulas and focus on scientific equivalence.", "method": "Introducing SurfaceBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 183 tasks across various categories, including ground-truth equations and three-dimensional data.", "result": "Experiments demonstrate limitations of current state-of-the-art frameworks in generalizing across different equation representation types and complexities.", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench establishes a novel benchmark for symbolic surface discovery, enabling thorough evaluation of equation discovery methods, particularly in complex domains."}}

This study investigates whether state-of-the-art text-to-speech systems have internalized the human tendency to reduce speech rate to convey politeness - a non-obvious prosodic marker. We prompted 22 synthetic voices from two leading AI platforms (AI Studio and OpenAI) to read a fixed script under both \"polite and formal\" and \"casual and informal\" conditions and measured the resulting speech duration. Across both AI platforms, the polite prompt produced slower speech than the casual prompt with very large effect sizes, an effect that was statistically significant for all of AI Studio's voices and for a large majority of OpenAI's voices.

We evaluated 15 open-weight LLMs on pathology and radiology reports across six use cases, colorectal liver metastases, liver tumours, neurodegenerative diseases, soft-tissue tumours, melanomas, and sarcomas, at three institutes in the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. Models included general-purpose and medical-specialised LLMs of various sizes, and six prompting strategies were compared: zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and prompt graph. Performance was assessed using task-appropriate metrics, with consensus rank aggregation and linear mixed-effects models quantifying variance. Top-ranked models achieved macro-average scores close to inter-rater agreement across tasks. Small-to-medium general-purpose models performed comparably to large models, while tiny and specialised models performed worse. Prompt graph and few-shot prompting improved performance by ~13%.

This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams.

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "EarthSight is a distributed framework for satellite image analysis that improves processing time and reduces latency by optimizing computation and prioritizing images.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this work is to address the delays caused by traditional satellite image processing methods, which are hampered by limited bandwidth and isolated compute nodes.", "method": "EarthSight uses multi-task inference on satellites, a ground-station query scheduler, and dynamic filter ordering to enhance the image analysis process.", "result": "Evaluations showed that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and decreases the 90th percentile end-to-end latency from 51 minutes to 21 minutes compared to existing methods.", "conclusion": "EarthSight significantly improves the efficiency and speed of satellite image processing by employing a distributed decision-making framework that optimizes computation and prioritizes image transmission."}}

Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u591a\u5173\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5e76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u5e94\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6025\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86MJCA\u6a21\u5757\u548cBiGRU\u5c42\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0cMJCA\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PI-MJCA-BiGRU\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b26\u5408\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

Traditional universal compressors like gzip offer low computational overhead, high speed, and broad applicability across data distributions. However, they often lead to worse compression rates than modern neural compressors, which leverage large-scale training data to model data distributions more effectively. Despite their advantages, neural compressors struggle to generalize to unseen data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that performs Test-Time Steering via a Weighted Product of Experts (wPoE). At inference, our method adaptively combines a universal compression model with a pretrained neural language model, ensuring the compression rate is at least as good as that of the best individual model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of text compression without requiring fine-tuning. Furthermore, it seamlessly integrates with any autoregressive language model, providing a practical solution for enhancing text compression across diverse data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0clossless\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u538b\u7f29\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u4ee3\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ea7\u54c1\uff08wPoE\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u8111\u533a\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u8111\u533a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u957f\u671f\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u7269\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u75be\u75c5\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8111\u533a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u66f4\u597d\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u51fa\u5e38\u89c4\u8fde\u63a5\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u989d\u5916\u75be\u75c5\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Such evaluations often rely on a curated benchmark set of input prompts provided to the LLM, where the output for each prompt may be assessed in a binary fashion (e.g., harmful/non-harmful or does not leak/leaks sensitive information), and the aggregation of binary scores is used to evaluate the LLM. However, existing approaches to evaluation often neglect statistical uncertainty quantification. With an applied statistics audience in mind, we provide background on LLM text generation and evaluation, and then describe a Bayesian approach for quantifying uncertainty in binary evaluation metrics. We focus in particular on uncertainty that is induced by the probabilistic text generation strategies typically deployed in LLM-based systems. We present two case studies applying this approach: 1) evaluating refusal rates on a benchmark of adversarial inputs designed to elicit harmful responses, and 2) evaluating pairwise preferences of one LLM over another on a benchmark of open-ended interactive dialogue examples.

Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates.

Our benchmark spans four diverse tasks: open-domain question answering, document summarization, English-to-X translation, and culturally grounded dialogue. We combine \\textbf{human evaluations} (rating fluency, factual accuracy, and cultural appropriateness) with automated metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) to assess model performance.\n  Our results reveal that while the largest proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4, Claude~3.5) generally lead across languages and tasks, significant gaps persist in culturally nuanced understanding and morphological generalization. Notably, GPT-4o demonstrates robust multilingual performance even on cross-lingual tasks, and Claude~3.5~Sonnet achieves competitive accuracy on knowledge and reasoning benchmarks. However, all models struggle to some extent with the unique linguistic challenges of each language, such as Turkish agglutinative morphology and Cantonese colloquialisms. Smaller open-source models (LLaMA-2~13B, Mistral~7B) lag substantially in fluency and accuracy, highlighting the resource disparity.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56fe\u57fa\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u548c\u6d88\u6781\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u57fa\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet-1K\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u79ef\u6781\u4e0e\u6d88\u6781\u63d0\u793a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual \"knowledge\" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations.

Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies.

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

We show that even meaning-preserving paraphrases can cause large fluctuations in safety scores, revealing a lack of semantic grounding. To address this, we introduce a practical, self-supervised framework for improving the semantic robustness of guard models. Our method leverages paraphrase sets to enforce prediction consistency using a novel, skew-aware aggregation strategy for robust target computation. Notably, we find that standard aggregation methods like mean and median can degrade safety, underscoring the need for skew-aware alternatives. We analyze six open-source guard models and show that our approach reduces semantic variability across paraphrases by ~58%, improves benchmark accuracy by ~2.5% on average, and generalizes to unseen stylistic variations. Intriguingly, we discover a bidirectional relationship between model calibration and consistency: our robustness training improves calibration by up to 40%, revealing a fundamental connection between these properties.

To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5HCD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5f3a\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8865\u5145\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08CFM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u5bf9\u6570\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u53bb\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u786e\u4fdd\u5b50\u5bf9\u6570\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "HCD\u548cSDD\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001CUB200\u548cImageNet-1K\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD) \u548c Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) \u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5bf9\u6570\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u7834\u574f\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7834\u574f\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8eAkg\u00fcn\u7b49\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms.

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment.

Previous studies tend to rely on the model itself to implicitly learn semantic modeling during training, and resort to inefficient and costly manual annotations for these two challenges. To mitigate these limitations, we propose enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) speech projector, where each expert specializes in the semantic subspace of a specific language, enabling fine-grained modeling of speech features. Additionally, we introduce a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes readily available monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) and monolingual ST data, facilitating speech-text alignment and improving translation capabilities. During training, we leverage a combination of language-specific loss and intra-group load balancing loss to guide the MoE speech projector in efficiently allocating tokens to the appropriate experts, across expert groups and within each group, respectively. To bridge the data gap across different training stages and improve adaptation to the CS scenario, we further employ a transition loss, enabling smooth transitions of data between stages, to effectively address the scarcity of high-quality CS speech translation data.

In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence.

Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic.

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context.

To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Most existing demonstration selection methods primarily focus on semantic similarity between test inputs and demonstrations, often overlooking the importance of label distribution alignment. To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage demonstration selection method, TopK + Label Distribution Divergence (L2D), which leverages a fine-tuned BERT-like small language model (SLM) to generate label distributions and calculate their divergence for both test inputs and candidate demonstrations. This enables the selection of demonstrations that are not only semantically similar but also aligned in label distribution with the test input. Extensive experiments across seven text classification benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms previous demonstration selection strategies.

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \\textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived.

Applying complex layers or even training standalone networks for better prediction introduces high computation overhead. In this paper, we propose pre-attention expert prediction to achieve accurate and lightweight expert prefetching. The key insight is that some functions in LLMs are ranking-preserving, indicating that matching the ranking of selected experts using simple linear functions is possible. Therefore, we utilize the activations before the attention block in the same layer with 2 linear functions and ranking-aware loss to achieve accurate prediction, which also supports prefetching in the first layer.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u4e24\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3CIL\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CIL\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6587\u672c\u539f\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11\u5148\u524d\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4f1a\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DMC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5373\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f6f\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002\u5f15\u5165DMC-OT\uff0c\u5bf9\u7c7b\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f73\u4f20\u8f93\u5f15\u5bfc\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7801\u66f4\u65b0\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001Imagenet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0cDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DMC\u548cDMC-OT\u5728CIL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0cDMC-OT\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u73871.80%\u3002"}}

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks.

These emissions are largely contributed to by the production, use and disposal of consumer products. Thus, it is important to build tools to estimate the environmental impact of consumer goods, an essential part of which is conducting Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs). LCAs specify and account for the appropriate processes involved with the production, use, and disposal of the products. We present SpiderGen, an LLM-based workflow which integrates the taxonomy and methodology of traditional LCA with the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of LLMs to generate the procedural information used for LCA. We additionally evaluate the output of SpiderGen using real-world LCA documents as ground-truth. We find that SpiderGen provides accurate LCA process information that is either fully correct or has minor errors, achieving an F1-Score of 62% across 10 sample data points. We observe that the remaining missed processes and hallucinated errors occur primarily due to differences in detail between LCA documents, as well as differences in the \"scope\" of which auxiliary processes must also be included. We also demonstrate that SpiderGen performs better than several baselines techniques, such as chain-of-thought prompting and one-shot prompting. Finally, we highlight SpiderGen's potential to reduce the human effort and costs for estimating carbon impact, as it is able to produce LCA process information for less than \\$1 USD in under 10 minutes as compared to the status quo LCA, which can cost over \\$25000 USD and take up to 21-person days.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51faSpiderGen\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5168\u7403\u53d8\u6696\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u4f30\u7b97\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfLCA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u751f\u6210LCA\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "SpiderGen\u5728\u771f\u5b9eLCA\u6587\u6863\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa62%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u751f\u6210LCA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "SpiderGen\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08LCA\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead.

We selected open source models based on the most common alignment methods, namely, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). We conducted a systematic analysis using statistical methods to verify how sensitive the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is when we apply variations to prompts designed to elicit inappropriate content from LLMs. Our results show that even small prompt modifications can significantly change the Attack Success Rate (ASR) according to the statistical tests we run, making the models more or less susceptible to types of attack. Critically, our results demonstrate that running existing 'attack benchmarks' alone may not be sufficient to elicit all possible vulnerabilities of both models and alignment methods. This paper thus contributes to ongoing efforts on model attack evaluation by means of systematic and statistically-based analyses of the different alignment methods and how sensitive their ASR is to prompt variation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5c0f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u8c03\u6574\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u57fa\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4fee\u6539\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387 (ASR)\u3002"}}

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training.

Consequently, research has focused on evaluating the robustness of LLMs, an essential quality for real-world tasks. In this paper, we employ simple multi-turn follow-up prompts to evaluate models' answer changes, model accuracy dynamics across turns with Markov chains, and examine whether linear probes can predict these changes. Our results show significant vulnerabilities in LLM robustness: a simple \"Think again\" prompt led to an approximate 10% accuracy drop for Gemini 1.5 Flash over nine turns, while combining this prompt with a semantically equivalent reworded question caused a 7.5% drop for Claude 3.5 Haiku. Additionally, we find that model accuracy across turns can be effectively modeled using Markov chains, enabling the prediction of accuracy probabilities over time. This allows for estimation of the model's stationary (long-run) accuracy, which we find to be on average approximately 8% lower than its first-turn accuracy for Gemini 1.5 Flash. Our results from a model's hidden states also reveal evidence that linear probes can help predict future answer changes. Together, these results establish stationary accuracy as a principled robustness metric for interactive settings and expose the fragility of models under repeated questioning. Addressing this instability will be essential for deploying LLMs in high-stakes and interactive settings where consistent reasoning is as important as initial accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u505c\u7559\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u589e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u7eed\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u505c\u7559\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u9996\u8f6e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u7ea68%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6613\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u505c\u7559\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.\n  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

We investigate gender bias dynamics across three generations of recursive text generation using three complementary evaluation frameworks: rule-based pattern matching, embedding-based semantic similarity, and downstream task performance. Experiments with three initial bias levels (0.1, 0.3, 0.6) and four mitigation strategies reveal equilibrium dynamics rather than monotonic amplification. The low initial bias amplifies toward the model's inherent bias level (+36%), whereas the high initial bias decays toward it (-26%). Among mitigation methods, contrastive augmentation, which introduces gender-swapped variants, achieves significant downstream bias reduction (98.8% for low initial bias and 91% on average) despite producing higher embedding-based bias scores.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset.

In this paper, we use the systems' preference bias to study their hidden language: During the process of compressing the input images (typically containing multiple concepts) into texts and then reconstructing them into images, the systems' inherent preference bias introduces specific shifts in the outputs, disrupting the original input concept co-occurrence. We employ the multi-round \"telephone game\" to strategically leverage this bias. By observing the co-occurrence frequencies of concepts in telephone games, we quantitatively investigate the concept connection strength in the understanding of multimodal systems, i.e., \"hidden language.\" We also contribute Telescope, a dataset of 10,000+ concept pairs, as the database of our telephone game framework. Our telephone game is test-time scalable: By iteratively running telephone games, we can construct a global map of concept connections in multimodal systems' understanding. Here we can identify preference bias inherited from training, assess generalization capability advancement, and discover more stable pathways for fragile concept connections. Furthermore, we use Reasoning-LLMs to uncover unexpected concept relationships that transcend textual and visual similarities, inferring how multimodal systems understand and simulate the world.

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u53caDART\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22VAT\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684DART\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u610fUDA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "DART\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684DART\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Although they are indispensable to evaluate model performance on various tasks, it is uncertain whether the models trained on Internet data have genuinely learned how to solve problems or merely seen the questions before. This potential data contamination issue presents a fundamental challenge to establishing trustworthy evaluation frameworks. Meanwhile, existing benchmarks predominantly assume benign, resource-rich settings, leaving the behavior of LLMs under pressure unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Squid Game, a dynamic and adversarial evaluation environment with resource-constrained and asymmetric information settings elaborated to evaluate LLMs through interactive gameplay against other LLM opponents. Notably, Squid Game consists of six elimination-style levels, focusing on multi-faceted abilities, such as instruction-following, code, reasoning, planning, and safety alignment. We evaluate over 50 LLMs on Squid Game, presenting the largest behavioral evaluation study of general LLMs on dynamic adversarial scenarios. We observe a clear generational phase transition on performance in the same model lineage and find evidence that some models resort to speculative shortcuts to win the game, indicating the possibility of higher-level evaluation paradigm contamination in static benchmarks. Furthermore, we compare prominent LLM benchmarks and Squid Game with correlation analyses, highlighting that dynamic evaluation can serve as a complementary part for static evaluations.

To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks.

While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts.

Leveraging historical records from the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), we developed a bias evaluation framework comprising three distinct tests to explore nation-level bias in various LLMs, with a particular focus on the five permanent members of the UNSC. Experimental results show that, even with the general bias patterns across models (e.g., favorable biases toward the western nations, and unfavorable biases toward Russia), these still vary based on the LLM. Notably, even within the same LLM, the direction and magnitude of bias for a nation change depending on the evaluation context. This observation suggests that LLM biases are fundamentally multidimensional, varying across models and tasks. We also observe that models with stronger reasoning abilities show reduced bias and better performance. Building on this finding, we introduce a debiasing framework that improves LLMs' factual reasoning combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Reflexion-based self-reflection techniques. Experiments show it effectively reduces nation-level bias, and improves performance, particularly in GPT-4o-mini and LLama-3.3-70B.

While sparse attention mechanisms like RingAttention reduce computational costs by restricting attention to local neighborhoods, they suffer from limited receptive fields and lack of adaptability. We present \\PiAttention, a periodic sparse Transformer that factorizes attention into ring-local neighborhoods, deterministic $\u03c0$-stride skips, and an adaptive fusion gate. The periodic structure provides predictable coverage of distant tokens, while the sparse footprint keeps the per-layer complexity linear in context length.

Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework.

We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "EGuR\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u540e\u671f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u5176\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5143\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5b8c\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u91c7\u6837\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "EGuR\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad814%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe111\u500d\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "EGuR\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347KGEs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7ecf\u5e38\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4e4b\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u4e3a\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86KGEs\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u5d4c\u5165\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5d4c\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5feb\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control.

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata.

Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

Do they form shared multilingual representations with language-specific decoding, and if so, why does performance still favor the dominant training language? To address this, we train a series of LLMs on different mixtures of multilingual data and analyze their internal mechanisms using cross-layer transcoders (CLT) and attribution graphs. Our results provide strong evidence for pivot language representations: the model employs nearly identical representations across languages, while language-specific decoding emerges in later layers. Attribution analyses reveal that decoding relies in part on a small set of high-frequency language features in the final layers, which linearly read out language identity from the first layers in the model. By intervening on these features, we can suppress one language and substitute another in the model's outputs. Finally, we study how the dominant training language influences these mechanisms across attribution graphs and decoding pathways.

However, models often rely on annotations that reflect dominant cultural norms, limiting model ability to recognize emotional expression in dialects often excluded from training data distributions, such as African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This study examines emotion recognition model performance on AAVE compared to General American English (GAE). We analyze 2.7 million tweets geo-tagged within Los Angeles. Texts are scored for strength of AAVE using computational approximations of dialect features. Annotations of emotion presence and intensity are collected on a dataset of 875 tweets with both high and low AAVE densities. To assess model accuracy on a task as subjective as emotion perception, we calculate community-informed \"silver\" labels where AAVE-dense tweets are labeled by African American, AAVE-fluent (ingroup) annotators. On our labeled sample, GPT and BERT-based models exhibit false positive prediction rates of anger on AAVE more than double than on GAE. SpanEmo, a popular text-based emotion model, increases false positive rates of anger from 25 percent on GAE to 60 percent on AAVE. Additionally, a series of linear regressions reveals that models and non-ingroup annotations are significantly more correlated with profanity-based AAVE features than ingroup annotations. Linking Census tract demographics, we observe that neighborhoods with higher proportions of African American residents are associated with higher predictions of anger (Pearson's correlation r = 0.27) and lower joy (r = -0.10). These results find an emergent safety issue of emotion AI reinforcing racial stereotypes through biased emotion classification. We emphasize the need for culturally and dialect-informed affective computing systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u5316\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u79cd\u65cf\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790270\u4e07\u6761\u5730\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u63a8\u6587\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9875\u6761\u63a8\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u793e\u533a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u8bb0\u5efa\u7acb\u201c\u94f6\u6807\u7b7e\u201d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGPT\u548cBERT\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6124\u6012\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6b63\u4f8b\u9884\u6d4b\u7387\u662f\u666e\u901a\u7f8e\u56fd\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u4e24\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u60c5\u611f\u65f6\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u60c5\u611fAI\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u60c5\u611f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5bf9\u975e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u975e\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u65b9\u8a00\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u52a0\u5f3a\u79cd\u65cf\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5177\u6587\u5316\u548c\u65b9\u8a00\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization.

The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems.

The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants.

Under review at IWSDS 2026", "summary": "LLMs are increasingly employed as judges across a variety of tasks, including those involving everyday social interactions. Yet, it remains unclear whether such LLM-judges can reliably assess tasks that require social or conversational judgment. We investigate how an LLM's conviction is changed when a task is reframed from a direct factual query to a Conversational Judgment Task. Our evaluation framework contrasts the model's performance on direct factual queries with its assessment of a speaker's correctness when the same information is presented within a minimal dialogue, effectively shifting the query from \"Is this statement correct?\" to \"Is this speaker correct?\". Furthermore, we apply pressure in the form of a simple rebuttal (\"The previous answer is incorrect.\") to both conditions. This perturbation allows us to measure how firmly the model maintains its position under conversational pressure. Our findings show that while some models like GPT-4o-mini reveal sycophantic tendencies under social framing tasks, others like Llama-8B-Instruct become overly-critical. We observe an average performance change of 9.24% across all models, demonstrating that even minimal dialogue context can significantly alter model judgment, underscoring conversational framing as a key factor in LLM-based evaluation.

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{D}ynamic Deep \\textbf{G}raph Learning for \\textbf{I}ncomplete \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{V}iew \\textbf{C}lustering with \\textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization.

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function.

Previous research has focused on detecting and addressing negative attention heads that induce negative bias. However, the underlying detailed factors influencing negative bias remain underexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit format-level negative bias, meaning the prompt format more influences their responses than the semantics of the negative response. For the fine-grained study of the negative bias, we introduce a pipeline for constructing the evaluation set, which systematically categorizes the dataset into three subsets based on the model's parametric knowledge: correct, incorrect, and insufficient relevant knowledge. Through analysis of this evaluation set, we identify a shortcut behavior in which models tend to generate negative responses when they lack sufficient knowledge to answer a yes-no question, leading to negative bias. We further examine how negative bias changes under various prompting scenarios related to parametric knowledge. We observe that providing relevant context and offering an \"I don't know\" option generally reduces negative bias, whereas chain-of-thought prompting tends to amplify the bias. Finally, we demonstrate that the degree of negative bias can vary depending on the type of prompt, which influences the direction of the response.

Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions.

However, it remains unclear whether these tool-enabled gains reflect trustworthy reasoning. Focusing on the Code Interpreter tool, we show that even when tools are selected and executed correctly, TaLMs treat tool outputs as substitutes for reasoning, producing solutions that appear correct but lack coherent justification. We term this failure mode Tool-Induced Myopia (TIM), and study it using PYMATH, a benchmark of 1,679 competition-level mathematical problems for which Python code is helpful but not sufficient. We further develop a multi-dimensional evaluation suite to quantify reasoning degradation in TaLMs relative to their non-tool counterparts. Our findings reveal that while TaLMs achieve up to a 19.3 percentage point gain in final-answer accuracy, their reasoning behavior consistently deteriorates (e.g., non-tool LLMs win up to 41.5% more often in pairwise comparisons of the reasoning process). This degradation intensifies with tool use; the more frequently a model invokes tools, the less coherent its reasoning becomes. Moreover, tool use shifts errors from arithmetic mistakes toward global reasoning failures (logic, assumption, creativity); with TIM present in ~55% of high-risk cases. Finally, we propose a preference-optimization-based framework that realigns TaLMs to use tools as assistive evidence, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning depth under tool use.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence.

Each model was evaluated under different preprocessing and augmentation strategies (for example, synonym replacement, word embeddings, etc.). Among traditional ML approaches, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with data augmentation achieved the best overall performance, reaching 94 percent accuracy, recall, and F1 scores with minimal overfitting. In contrast, the RNN models and BERT suffered from severe overfitting, while RoBERTa initially overcame it but began to show signs as training progressed. Finally, zero-shot evaluations of large language models (LLMs) indicated that OpenAI and Gemini performed best among the tested LLMs, achieving approximately 0.72-0.73 accuracy and comparable F1 scores.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 HealSplit\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u88c2\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6bd2\u5bb3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u9488\u5bf9 SFL \u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9 SFL \u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "HealSplit \u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5927\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6062\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6bd2\u5bb3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHealSplit \u5728\u5404\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "HealSplit \u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u5206\u88c2\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SFL\uff09\u91cf\u8eab\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6062\u590d\u4e94\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6bd2\u5bb3\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5341\u79cd\u5c16\u7aef\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90e8\u52063D\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u72b6\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u72b6\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks.

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "EHR\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u5c11\u6570\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72ed\u4e49\u7684\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30EHR\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u5bb6\u65cf\u764c\u75c7\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81eaAll of Us\u7814\u7a76\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "EHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u9274\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u764c\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b03\u52306\u500d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u764c\u75c7\u6848\u4f8b\u5bcc\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14EHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u572826\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff08EHR\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u764c\u75c7\u4e2a\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM.

Among these, direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a widely adopted technique that fine-tunes LLMs on preferred completions over less favorable ones. While most frontier LLMs do not disclose their curated preference pairs, the broader LLM community has released several open-source DPO datasets, including TuluDPO, ORPO, UltraFeedback, HelpSteer, and Code-Preference-Pairs. However, systematic comparisons remain scarce, largely due to the high computational cost and the lack of rich quality annotations, making it difficult to understand how preferences were selected, which task types they span, and how well they reflect human judgment on a per-sample level. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, data-centric analysis of popular open-source DPO corpora. We leverage the Magpie framework to annotate each sample for task category, input quality, and preference reward, a reward-model-based signal that validates the preference order without relying on human annotations. This enables a scalable, fine-grained inspection of preference quality across datasets, revealing structural and qualitative discrepancies in reward margins. Building on these insights, we systematically curate a new DPO mixture, UltraMix, that draws selectively from all five corpora while removing noisy or redundant samples. UltraMix is 30% smaller than the best-performing individual dataset yet exceeds its performance across key benchmarks. We publicly release all annotations, metadata, and our curated mixture to facilitate future research in data-centric preference optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6UltraMix\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u4e2a\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e86\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u73b0\u6709DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53cd\u6620\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Magpie\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u504f\u597d\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90DPO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86\u65b0\u7684DPO\u7ec4\u5408UltraMix\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684UltraMix\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8630%\u3002"}}

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances.

Under review for MIDL 2026", "summary": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86DRRs\u5728CAC\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "CT\u4e3aCAC\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u76f8\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528COCA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684667\u4e2aCT\u626b\u63cf\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210DRRs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e73\u5747AUC\u8fbe\u52300.754\uff0c\u4e0e\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eCXR\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "DRRs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684CAC\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5728\u771f\u5b9eCXRs\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training.

Detecting such attacks can improve transparency in political discourse and provide insights for journalists, analysts and the public. Advances in deep learning and transformer-based models, particularly BERT and large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities for automated detection of harmful language. Motivated by these developments, we present a framework for analysing personal attacks in U.S. presidential debates. Our work involves manual annotation of debate transcripts across the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles, followed by statistical and language-model based analysis. We investigate the potential of fine-tuned transformer models alongside general-purpose LLMs to detect personal attacks in formal political speech.

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection.

In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u822a\u5929\u5668\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u9700\u8981\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u67b6\u6784\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5339\u914d\u5206\u6790\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9636\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u534f\u8bae\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HinD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u79c0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b7\u51bb\u76847B\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u751f\u6210Hindsight-Zero\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Chain-of-Thought\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "result": "HinD\u5728OK-VQA\u548cA-OKVQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HinD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u9f13\u52b1\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08KEPO\uff09\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property.

This challenge arises primarily due to constrained model context windows and the sparsity of relevant information within extensive contextual noise. To solve this, we propose the SAP$^{2}$ method, a novel framework that dynamically prunes and integrates relevant contextual keywords in two stages. Specifically, each stage leverages our proposed Speech-Driven Attention-based Pooling mechanism, enabling efficient compression of context embeddings while preserving speech-salient information.

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OT-ALD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u52a9\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "DDIB\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\uff08OT\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6846\u67b6OT-ALD\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684OT\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "OT-ALD\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u9876\u5c16\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620.29%\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u4e862.6\u7684FID\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "OT-ALD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86FID\u5206\u6570\u3002"}}

Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh.

We introduce a linguistically grounded supersense typology for adverbs, empirically validated through annotation, that captures major semantic domains including manner, temporal, frequency, degree, domain, speaker-oriented, and subject-oriented functions. Results from a pilot annotation study demonstrate that these categories provide broad coverage of adverbs in natural text and can be reliably assigned by human annotators. Incorporating this typology extends WordNet's coverage, aligns it more closely with linguistic theory, and facilitates downstream NLP applications such as word sense disambiguation, event extraction, sentiment analysis, and discourse modeling.

Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times.

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "RETROFIT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u654f\u611f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u64ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "RETROFIT\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u8bc4\u5206\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u6458\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86BLEU\u5206\u6570\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "RETROFIT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u6458\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records.

Project Page- https://refine-align.github.io/", "summary": "In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63a8\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fa9\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6AlignVQA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u7b54\u6848\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u5224\u548c\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0cAlignVQA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\u5f02\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "AlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002"}}

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion.

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data.

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings.

We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.\n  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5747\u5300\u5206\u7bb1\u548c\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7bb1\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6216\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u5300\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7bb1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 \u03bcm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.\n  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events.

We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality.

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases.

Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].\n  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \\emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al.

To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry.

We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics.

Training-time alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) face prohibitive costs in expert supervision and inherent scalability limitations, offering limited dynamic control during inference. Consequently, there is an urgent need for scalable and adaptable alignment mechanisms. To address this, we propose W2S-AlignTree, a pioneering plug-and-play inference-time alignment framework that synergistically combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with the Weak-to-Strong Generalization paradigm for the first time. W2S-AlignTree formulates LLM alignment as an optimal heuristic search problem within a generative search tree. By leveraging weak model's real-time, step-level signals as alignment proxies and introducing an Entropy-Aware exploration mechanism, W2S-AlignTree enables fine-grained guidance during strong model's generation without modifying its parameters. The approach dynamically balances exploration and exploitation in high-dimensional generation search trees. Experiments across controlled sentiment generation, summarization, and instruction-following show that W2S-AlignTree consistently outperforms strong baselines.

While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u504f\u7f6e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u5230\u591a\u79cd\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u7f6e\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u5934\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5f00\u5934\u548c\u7ed3\u5c3e\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

We open-source its 1,100 expert-authored tasks and 19,356 expert-curated criteria, making it, to our knowledge, the largest public, rubric-based benchmark for both legal and finance domains. We recruit 182 qualified professionals, holding JDs, CFAs, or 6+ years of experience, who contributed tasks inspired by their actual workflows. This process yields significant diversity, with tasks spanning 114 countries and 47 US jurisdictions. Our expert-curated rubrics are validated through a rigorous quality pipeline, including independent expert validation. Subsequent evaluation of 20 leading models reveals substantial room for improvement, with top scores of only 0.39 (Finance) and 0.37 (Legal) on our Hard subsets. We further catalog associated economic impacts of the prompts and analyze performance using human-annotated rubric categories.

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process.

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEODE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u67b6\u6784GEODE\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u89e3\u8026\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u56de\u5f52\u5934\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "GEODE\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e867B+\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "GEODE\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u80263D\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module.

This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference.

In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs.

However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $\u03a6$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details.

A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting.

This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color.

While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.\n  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.\n  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.", "AI": {"tldr": "YCB-Ev SD \u662f\u4e00\u5957\u7528\u4e8e 6DoF \u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5408\u6210\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b 5 \u4e07\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u4f9b\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5bf9\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6784\u5efa YCB-Ev SD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3 6DoF \u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6e32\u67d3\uff08PBR\uff09\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210 50,000 \u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u7ebf\u6027\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e CNN \u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6781\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u6bd4\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "YCB-Ev SD \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a 6DoF \u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u9762\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u6781\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts.

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity.

To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u666e\u904d\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u5728\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u548c\u518d\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5316\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u5316\u5171\u9e23\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ecf\u5178\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u8be0\u91ca\u5982\u4f55\u63cf\u7ed8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u5206\u5f00\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6767\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\u4e8eWikidata\u7684\u6587\u5316\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u533a\u5206\u590d\u5236\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4e8e\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5411\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale.

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse.

However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.
