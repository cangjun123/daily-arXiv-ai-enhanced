### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了时间增强YOLOv5和CBAM在水下物体检测中的作用，结果表明T-YOLOv5明显提高了检测准确性，而CBAM进一步提升了在复杂场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究空间时间建模和空间注意力机制在深度学习模型中对于水下物体检测的有效性。

Method: 评估时间增强版YOLOv5变体T-YOLOv5与标准YOLOv5的性能，并开发增强版T-YOLOv5，加入卷积块注意力模块（CBAM）。

Result: YOLOv5的mAP@50-95为0.563，而T-YOLOv5和带CBAM的T-YOLOv5的mAP@50-95分别为0.813和0.811，显示出它们在检测复杂物体时的优越准确性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: T-YOLOv5显著提高了对比标准YOLOv5的检测可靠性，而带有CBAM的T-YOLOv5在复杂场景下进一步提升了性能，但在简单场景中准确性有所下降。

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569)
*Wen Xie,Yanjun Zhu,Gijs Overgoor,Yakov Bart,Agata Lapedriza Garcia,Sarah Ostadabbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化视频广告剪辑框架，强调音频在广告中的作用，并开发了新的数据集AdSum204，通过实验表明该模型在多个指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告商通常在单一活动中需要不同时长的同一广告的多个版本，而传统方法人工选择和重新编辑视频广告的过程十分费时费力。

Method: 构建双流音视频融合模型，定义视频帧重要性，并在新创建的AdSum204数据集上进行大量实验。

Result: 提出了一种基于视频摘要技术的自动化视频广告剪辑框架，首次将视频剪辑视为广告特定的镜头选择问题，并开发了一个双流音视频融合模型，预测视频帧的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入针对广告的镜头选择和音频融合模型，显著提升了广告剪辑的效率，且在新数据集上的表现优于当前技术。

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

### [3] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO方法通过在训练中条件化多奖励模型，改善了图像生成质量并提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的文本到图像生成模型使用大型未整理的数据集，未能很好地满足用户偏好，而后处理方式限制了多样性和语义保真度。

Method: 在训练过程中通过多个奖励模型对文本生成的图像进行条件化，直接学习用户偏好。

Result: 提出的MIRO方法显著提升了生成图像的视觉质量，并加快了训练速度。

Conclusion: MIRO在GenEval基准测试和用户偏好评分上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [4] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，并通过BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集进行评估，证明了特定领域训练的必要性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电动自行车的流行，骑自行车者的脆弱性加剧，因此需要改进汽车感知技术以增强自行车安全。

Method: 使用多传感器'SenseBike'研究平台开发和评估一种针对自行车的3D LiDAR分割方法，并引入BikeScenes-lidarseg数据集进行模型性能评估。

Result: 通过在BikeScenes数据集上微调模型，我们实现了63.6%的平均交集并联（mIoU），明显超越了仅使用SemanticKITTI预训练所获得的13.8%。

Conclusion: 我们指出了自行车安装的感知系统在硬件限制下所面临的主要挑战，并贡献了BikeScenes数据集以推进骑行者中心的LiDAR分割研究。

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [5] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种机器学习方法用于扫描隧道显微镜图像修复和超分辨率，解决了尖端退化和数据采集缓慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到尖端退化和慢速数据采集对STM的限制，基于机器学习的方法可以为图像修复和超分辨率提供有效解决方案。

Method: 利用36张Si(001):H的实验图像数据集训练多种先进的流匹配和扩散模型，结合物理信息生成合成数据。

Result: 量化评估表明，模型能够有效修复图像，并将图像采集时间减少两到四倍，准确重建稀疏采样数据的图像。

Conclusion: 该框架有可能显著提高扫描隧道显微镜的实验效率，减少尖端调理频率，并提升现有高速度STM系统的帧率。

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [6] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无反演框架的流分解与聚合方法，解决了传统流模型在图像编辑中的限制，提升了输出的语义一致性和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决反演过程不精确和编辑过程中的梯度纠缠问题，提出新的流模型编辑框架。

Method: 通过将目标提示进行语义分解，计算每个子提示的独立流，并通过投影和软聚合机制进行集成，提升编辑质量。

Result: 所 提方法在语义表达和特征解耦上均表现优于现有的零-shot 方法。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，所提方法在语义忠实度和属性解耦方面优于现有的零-shot 编辑方法。

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

### [7] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究人员提出了一种名为"Brain-IT"的新方法，通过利用大脑的交互变换器（BIT）重建人们通过fMRI脑部记录所见图像，显著改善了图像重建的忠实度，且所需数据量大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现有的图像重建方法中，尽管有一些进展，但仍无法高效忠实地重建人们通过fMRI记录所见图像，因此有必要提出一种新的方法来改善这一点。

Method: 该方法采用脑交互变换器（BIT），通过共享功能集群和模型组件，针对不同受试者进行有效的信息整合，指导图像重建过程。

Result: 通过使用仅1小时的fMRI数据，该方法实现的图像重建结果与训练使用完整40小时记录的现有方法相当，展示了其有效性和数据利用效率。

Conclusion: Brain-IT方法通过实现功能性脑小体之间的有效互动，实现了高保真图像重建，并在视觉效果和标准客观指标上超越了现有的先进方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [8] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于SAM 2.1的模型，实现了在限制条件下的实时肿瘤追踪，并在TrackRAD2025挑战中获得优异成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对TrackRAD2025挑战，解决在数据稀缺条件下进行实时肿瘤追踪的需求。

Method: 采用IMPACT相似性度量的无监督配准与基于基础模型的分割方法相结合，结合目标提示进行训练。最终选用的模型是SAM 2.1，基于首个注释切片的掩码提示进行微调。

Result: 模型在隐藏测试集上取得0.8794的Dice评分，在TrackRAD2025挑战中排名第六。

Conclusion: 该模型在TrackRAD2025挑战中表现出色，证明了基础模型在MRI引导的放疗中进行实时肿瘤追踪的强大潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [9] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的Hilbert选择扫描机制，以提高Mamba框架在低光图像增强中的性能，同时减小资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在有效探索特征空间，捕捉复杂的细节，提高整体覆盖度，并减少信息不一致性，优化空间局部性以捕捉细微的局部交互，同时保持处理长距离依赖的能力。

Method: 通过增加Mamba框架的扫描模式的Hausdorff维度，采用新颖的Hilbert选择扫描机制，来增强Mamba框架。

Result: 在公开基准测试上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法显著提升了现有Mamba基础的低光图像增强方法的定量指标和定性视觉保真度，同时减少了计算资源消耗和缩短了推断时间。

Conclusion: 这一策略不仅推动了低光图像增强领域的前沿发展，同时在更广泛的Mamba技术应用领域也展现了潜在的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAVE是首个针对真实世界视觉异常的基准，揭示了先进视觉语言模型在异常检测和推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉领域在现实世界异常检测上的挑战依然存在，现有方法无法充分捕捉真实世界异常的复杂性和不可预测性。

Method: 提出了CAVE基准，涉及三个开放任务：异常描述、解释和理由提供，并配备细致的标注，涵盖异常的视觉表现、复杂性、严重性和常见性。

Result: 通过CAVE的测试，显示出最先进的视觉语言模型在视觉异常感知和常识推理方面表现不佳，尽管使用了高阶提示策略。

Conclusion: CAVE基准为异常检测和常识推理的研究提供了重要资源，并揭示了现有视觉语言模型在这些任务上的不足。

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 虽然现有多模态大型语言模型取得了显著进展，但复杂视频的时间动态理解仍存在巨大挑战。本文提出的Video-LLM架构通过在视觉编码器中引入时间注意力显著提高了模型在视频问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视频中的复杂时间动态是一个重大挑战，而现有的视频语言模型在时间理解方面存在关键局限性。

Method: 在视觉编码器中直接引入分层时间注意模块，以更好地捕捉行动的进展和帧之间的关系。

Result: 提出了一种引入分层时间注意模块的新的视频LLM架构，以改善视频理解能力。

Conclusion: 通过增强视觉编码器的时间结构，本文所提的方法有效弥补了视频理解中的关键缺口，提升了模型在行动识别方面的准确性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL是一种新的灵活的学习框架，能够在超声图像中以高效的方式进行骨骼区域的分割，尤其适合标注数据稀缺的医疗影像领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对儿童骨折的超声图像自动分割需求，提高诊断准确性及治疗计划的实效性，同时克服专家注释时间成本高的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为FlexICL的基于上下文学习的新框架，用于在超声图像中分割骨骼区域，专注于少量专家注释的帧进行模型训练。

Result: FlexICL在四个手腕和肘部超声数据集上的表现俱佳，仅使用5%的训练图像，超越了目前最先进的视觉ICL模型和传统分割模型。

Conclusion: FlexICL展示了极高的图像分割性能，特别是在标注数据稀缺的情况下，这是超声医学影像领域的一个重要进展。

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法结合视觉语言模型动态生成负提示，优化去噪过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发展更灵活的负提示生成策略，以克服传统方法的局限性。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型在扩散模型的去噪过程中动态生成消极提示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上进行评估，展示了负指导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在提高去噪过程中的负指导强度与文本-图像对齐之间的平衡方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

TL;DR: 本研究提出PReMA攻击，展示了多模态扩散模型在图像与文本对齐不足下的脆弱性，能够通过修改输入图像生成不当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于多模态扩散模型的易受攻击性，本研究旨在揭示其在文本与图像生成中的对齐问题，以防止生成不当内容。

Method: 提出了PReMA，一种通过仅生成对抗图像而攻击模型输出的新型方法。

Result: 本论文探讨了多模态扩散模型（例如文本到图像模型）在面对对抗样本时的脆弱性，揭示了现有模型在文本与图像模态之间的对齐不足，导致生成不当或不安全内容的风险。提出了一种新型攻击方法Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack（PReMA），其通过修改输入图像并结合特定提示来操纵生成内容，而不影响提示本身。这一方法利用对抗图像独特地改变模型输出，与之前主要生成对抗提示的方法不同。通过在图像修复和风格转移任务中全面评估，各种模型的结果证实了PReMA的有效性。

Conclusion: PReMA攻击方法显著威胁多模态扩散模型的完整性，尤其是在固定提示的图像编辑应用中表现突出。

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Motivation: 研究视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）在不同视角下对同一事件的时间理解的一致性。

Method: 提出了View-GRPO，一种新颖的强化学习框架，用于增强特定视角的时间推理能力并促进跨视角理解的一致性。

Result: 提出了EgoExo-Con（Consistency）基准，以评估现有模型在处理同步视频时的一致性和准确性。

Conclusion: EgoExo-Con基准揭示了当前Video-LLMs在保持一致性方面的局限性，并提出了有效的改进途径。

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 解决传统视图合成方法在相机姿态估计中遇到的计算瓶颈和误差传播问题

Method: 提出一个统一框架，联合优化3D高斯点和相机姿态

Result: 在多个数据集上表现出显著优于现有COLMAP-free技术的重建质量，并超越标准COLMAP基准

Conclusion: 该方法在处理大视角变化和稀疏特征分布的复杂场景中表现出色，显示了其优越性。

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的E2E驾驶基准测试缺乏对复杂长期边缘案例的评估，现有的评价指标无法有效捕捉多模态驾驶的特性。因此，我们需要一个新颖的数据集和评估方法来填补这些空白。

Method: 提出新的开放式评价指标Rater Feedback Score (RFS)，并发布针对WOD-E2E验证集的评估偏好标签。

Result: WOD-E2E数据集包含4021个驾驶片段，专门针对发生频率低于0.03%的长期边缘场景进行策划，并提供详细的状态和环境信息。

Conclusion: 通过引入WOD-E2E数据集及新的评估指标RFS，我们希望推动自主驾驶领域的研究，发展出能够应对复杂现实场景的增强型自主驾驶系统。

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Result: FullPart在3D部件生成的实验中展示了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FullPart框架在3D部件生成中表现出色，尤其在细节生成方面超越了先前方法。

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Conclusion: BasicAVSR在视频超分辨率任务中，展现了出色的性能和广泛的适应性，显著优于现有的方法。

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM基准的推出为多模态多轮对话的研究提供了新的评估标准和改进空间，特别是在可穿戴设备环境下。

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

Conclusion: MoTDiff通过条件扩散框架和新训练方法，能够精确识别细粒度的运动轨迹，保持运动路径整体形状与位置的一致性，且在模糊图像去模糊和编码曝光摄影中表现优异。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

Conclusion: 该方法在估计精度和速度上显著优于之前的模型，有效推动了草图到姿态的研究。

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Conclusion: 目前的多模态系统在视觉和语义关联方面表现良好，但在时间连续性和因果理解方面仍存在根本性缺陷。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

TL;DR: CATG是一个新的规划框架，可以有效解决轨迹生成中的多模态崩溃和安全约束问题，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模仿学习和生成方法在生成多样的轨迹假设和适应安全约束方面存在局限性，因此需要一个新的方法来改善这些问题。

Method: 提出了CATG框架，该框架通过显式建模流匹配过程来实施约束，并在生成过程中灵活地调整控制信号。

Result: CATG在NavSim v2挑战中获得第二名，并且以51.31的EPDMS分数获得创新奖。

Conclusion: CATG是一个新的规划框架，通过显式约束流匹配来解决自动驾驶中的多模态崩溃问题，并确保生成的轨迹满足安全和运动学规则。

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大规模情境和动态环境下，灵活监测地球表面的AEOS星座调度问题，现有方法未能有效解决复杂性，导致现实表现不足。

Method: 提出了AEOS-Former，一种基于Transformer的调度模型，结合了约束感知的注意力机制和内部约束模块，以应对复杂的调度场景。

Result: 结合AEOS-Bench基准套件，AEOS-Former在任务完成和能效方面表现优于基线模型，实验结果和消融研究验证了各组成部分的重要性。

Conclusion: AEOS-Bench是首个真实世界星座调度的基准，AEOS-Former通过内部约束模块提供了有效的调度解决方案。

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG驱动图像重建方法常常忽视空间注意机制，限制了生成图像的保真度和语义一致性。

Method: 使用自适应思维映射器进行EEG特征提取，并通过低秩适应微调稳定扩散模型，将神经信号与视觉语义对齐，同时使用ControlNet分支在显著性图上进行条件生成。

Result: 我们提出了一种双条件框架，通过结合EEG嵌入和空间显著性图来增强图像生成。

Conclusion: 结果表明，关注先验解决了EEG的模糊性，实现了高保真重建，并在医学诊断和神经自适应接口方面具有应用前景。

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench为长视频生成提供了全面可靠的评估平台，并指出了未来方法改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

TL;DR: A-TPT是一种新型的测试时间提示调优框架，通过引入角度多样性改善大规模视觉语言模型的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在文本特征分散不足导致的校准性能问题，提升模型的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 引入角度多样性，通过最大化单位超球面上文本特征的最小成对角距，来促使文本特征分布的均匀性。

Result: 本文提出了一种新的测试时间提示调优（TPT）框架——A-TPT，旨在通过引入角度多样性来提高大规模视觉语言模型（VLMs）在无标签数据任务上的适应能力。研究表明，当前的方法在文本特征的分离度和校准性能上存在不足，而A-TPT通过最大化单位超球面上特征的最小成对角距，从而实现文本特征的均匀分布，显著减少整体平均校准误差，同时保持较高的准确性。实验结果显示，A-TPT在自然分布变化和医疗数据集上表现出色，验证了鼓励角度多样性的重要性。

Conclusion: A-TPT通过最大化文本特征之间的最小成对角距，显著提高VLM在测试时间适配中的校准能力，尤其是在面对自然分布变化和医疗数据时表现突出。

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将现有的3D重建模型应用于点跟踪任务，以提高在动态场景中的跟踪效果。

Method: 结合重建损失、动态对应训练和可见性头，使用小量合成数据对MASt3R进行微调，仅在包含查询点的帧对中训练和评估。

Result: 提出了一种通过三维基础对应进行点跟踪的方法，在多个数据集上实现了竞争力或优越的点跟踪结果。

Conclusion: 通过动态和静态点对应的混合，所提出的PointSt3R在点跟踪任务上表现出色，特别是在动态场景中。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了FineGrainedAD框架，通过多级细粒度语义字幕提升少样本异常检测的性能，实验结果表明在相关数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的FSAD方法因缺乏详细的文本描述而导致语义错位和定位性能不佳，本研究旨在通过提供更丰富的语义信息来改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了多级细粒度语义字幕（MFSC），并基于此构建了FineGrainedAD框架，包含多级可学习提示（MLLP）和多级语义对齐（MLSA）两大组件。

Result: 该研究提出了一种名为FineGrainedAD的框架，通过多级细粒度语义字幕（MFSC）提升少样本异常检测（FSAD）的性能。当前FSAD方法主要依赖视觉-语言模型（VLM）的泛化能力，以特征相似性检测异常区域，但由于文本描述不足，导致图像描述和局部视觉异常之间的语义错位，从而影响定位性能。针对这一问题，MFSC引入多级、细粒度的文本描述，并基于此开发了FineGrainedAD框架。该框架包含两个组件：多级可学习提示（MLLP）和多级语义对齐（MLSA），旨在通过引入细粒度语义和区域聚合策略，提升异常定位的准确性。实验结果显示，在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上，FineGrainedAD在少样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD框架显著提高了少样本异常检测任务中异常定位的准确性，尤其是在数据集MVTec-AD和VisA上。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中对象-上下文快捷方式的问题，提高其在不同环境下的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种轻量级的反事实方法，为去偏和可靠的多模态推理提供了实用的因果途径。

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 识别并解决大型视觉语言模型在自我改进过程中对简单查询的过度依赖，以提升其对复杂推理任务的处理能力。

Result: 本论文探讨了大型视觉语言模型 (LVLMs) 中自我改进的应用，指出在学习和提升推理能力的过程中，模型在简单查询上表现优异，但在复杂查询上却存在瓶颈，导致优化不平衡。这种现象称为"马太效应"，因此，模型在自我改进中面临更复杂推理任务的障碍。为了解决此问题，作者提出了四种有效策略，从再分布和轨迹重采样两个方面入手，以实现头尾平衡。实验表明，这些方法在视觉推理任务中显著提升了模型的能力。

Conclusion: 提出的策略成功改善了大型视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现，减少了优化不平衡问题。

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: 尽管扩展搜索空间未见效果，模型在不同验证下仍展现出良好的适应性，证明了自适应检测器的潜力。

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉问答模型在转向远程感测、医学影像等领域时泛化能力显著下降，因此需要一个灵活、低成本的跨域适应方案。

Method: 通过引入领域分类器和双适配器机制，CATCH能够动态调整图像类型和特征，无需重新训练主模型。

Result: 在MathVQA、MedVQA-RAD和ChartQA等四个基准测试上，CATCH在不重训练主模型的情况下，实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: CATCH框架在多个领域特定的视觉问答基准测试中显示出了一致的性能提升，能够实现跨域的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at
https://github.com/baaivision/Emu3.5 to support community research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据驱动的机器学习技术的进步，希望通过更强的数据先验来提高计算超分辨率的效果。

Method: 使用引导条件流匹配学习改进的数据先验进行超分辨率重建。

Result: ResMatching在BioSR数据集上的评估中表现出与七个基线方法的竞争力，达到数据保真度与感知现实性之间的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ResMatching方法在各个测试用例中均表现出色，能够提供数据不确定性评估。这为未来用户提供了拒绝不确定预测的指导。

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

TL;DR: 本论文介绍了一种新的深度学习模型CYPRESS，用于高分辨率农田油菜产量预测，优于传统方法，通过多时相卫星图像生成像素级产量图，为精细农业提供更可操作的工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确及时的作物产量预测对全球粮食安全和现代农业管理至关重要，传统方法缺乏所需的可扩展性和精细度。

Method: 利用预训练的大规模地理空间基础模型(Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M)进行细致的回归任务，以变换多时相卫星图像为像素级产量图。

Result: 在加拿大草原的综合数据集上进行评估，CYPRESS显示出优于现有深度学习基础的产量预测模型的表现。

Conclusion: CYPRESS展示了在高分辨率、场内油菜产量预测中的优越性能，为精细农业提供了一种可行的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对事件相机的令牌化方法Spiking Patches，显著提高了推理速度，同时保持了高准确性，为事件驱动视觉新方向铺平了道路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对事件相机的独特特性进行令牌化，以弥补传统帧和体素表示的时序和空间稀疏性损失。

Method: 使用Spiking Patches对事件进行令牌化，评估其在手势识别和物体检测中的表现，结合GNN、PCN和Transformer进行实验。

Result: Spiking Patches令牌的推理速度比体素令牌快最多3.4倍，比帧快最多10.4倍，且在手势识别和物体检测方面具有相等或更高的准确性。

Conclusion: Spiking Patches在事件相机的事件表示中实现了高效的令牌化，保持了空间稀疏性并提高了推理速度，同时不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Abstract: To address the challenges in UAV object detection, such as complex
backgrounds, severe occlusion, dense small objects, and varying lighting

algorithm specifically designed for small objects in UAV imagery. In the
backbone network, we introduce the Partially-Aware Detail Focus (PADF) Module
to enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the
Median-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the
model's ability to capture small-object details and contextual information.
Furthermore,we incorporate Focaler-SIoU to strengthen the model's bounding box
matching capability and increase its sensitivity to small-object features,
thereby further enhancing detection accuracy and robustness. Compared with
RT-DETR, our PT-DETR achieves mAP improvements of 1.6% and 1.7% on the

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

TL;DR: 本研究首次评估48种深度学习光流模型在海冰漂移估计中的应用，成果显示模型性能显著优于传统方法，提供了高精度的运动估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于海冰漂移对北极导航、气候研究和操作预报至关重要，传统光流方法在复杂情况下的准确度有限，因此探索使用先进的深度学习技术以提升海冰漂移估计的准确性成为必要。

Method: 我们对48种深度学习光流模型进行了大规模基准测试，使用RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR海冰图像和GNSS跟踪浮标进行评估，分析了模型的终点误差(EPE)和Fl指标。

Result: 本研究展示了将深度学习光流模型应用于海冰漂移估计的首个大规模基准。通过对48种深度学习光流模型的评估，我们发现多个模型达到了亚公里的准确度，显著提高了复杂情境中的运动估计准确性。新的光流法能够在北极遥感中高效捕捉区域漂移模式，为导航和气候建模提供了新的可能性。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，基于深度学习的光流方法在海冰漂移估计中展现出高效性和准确性，为未来的导航和气候研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

reducing unplanned breakdown costs. Server-based inference minimizes the
computational load on industrial process control systems (PLCs), supporting
scalable deployment across production lines with minimal additional resources.
By jointly analyzing sensor data from data acquisition systems and visual
inputs, the system identifies the location and probable root causes of
failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

extension to massive-scale environments, and recent progress toward
near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

Result: 本研究介绍了SteerVLM，这是一种轻量级引导模块，旨在指导视觉-语言模型（VLMs）生成更符合预期指令的输出。该方法通过学习配对提示的潜在嵌入，动态调整连接语言模态与图像上下文的激活，从而实现对复杂输出语义的细粒度实时控制，而无需修改模型权重，同时保留对次要任务的性能表现。我们的引导模块学习参数仅占原VLM大小的0.14%。该模块通过维度激活调制和层间自适应引导获得模型控制，而无需预先提取静态向量或手动调整干预点。此外，我们还介绍了VNIA（视觉叙事意图对齐），这是一个专门创建的多模态数据集，旨在促进VLM引导技术的发展和评估。我们的方法在引导和幻觉缓解基准测试中优于现有干预技术，并通过激活工程提出了一种强健的多模态模型控制解决方案。

Conclusion: SteerVLM提供了一种有效的方式来控制VLM输出，显示出优于现有技术的性能，是多模态模型控制的一种创新解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of

focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM

outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 当前视频到4D的方法需要手动标注的相机姿态，这在野外视频中既费力又脆弱，因此需要一种无需姿态标签的方法来合成4D内容。

Method: 提出了一种无姿态、基于轨迹到相机的框架，通过渲染至固定虚拟相机而不是显式轨迹预测，从而将相机控制与场景建模分离；并使用条件视频修复模型进行缺失区域的修复。

Conclusion: SEE4D在跨视角视频生成和稀疏重建基准测试中表现出色，相比于依赖于姿态或轨迹的基线方法，具有更好的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

Motivation: 通过图像标注学习视觉特征，提升下游视觉任务的表现，且不依赖于序列中每个标记的位置，从而减少对辅助目标的需求。

Method: 使用图像条件的掩码扩散语言模型进行图像标注，称为掩码扩散标注（MDC）。在训练过程中，随机选择比例对每个图像-标题对中的文本标记进行掩码处理，并训练一个条件于视觉特征的解码器以重建原始文本。

Result: 通过线性探测实验，证明所学习的视觉特征在多种学术规模的模型和数据集上与自回归和对比方法产出的视觉特征具有竞争力。

Conclusion: MDC方法在学习视觉特征方面表现出色，能够与传统方法相媲美，为视觉学习提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

Motivation: 探究视频生成模型在视觉推理场景中的零-shot 推理能力

Method: 进行实证研究

Result: 通过在12个维度上评估Veo-3的推理行为，发现其在短期空间一致性等方面表现出色，但在长期因果推理和抽象逻辑等方面存在局限性。

Conclusion: 当前的视频模型还未具备独立作为零-shot 推理器的可靠性，但与专门的推理模型结合时显示出积极的潜力。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过引入StreetMath基准，评估大语言模型在非自回归解码器中的近似推理能力，结果显示模型在近似任务上表现不佳且消耗更多资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究关注大语言模型在精确算术操作中的表现，但它们在快速、非正式数学运算中的近似推理能力仍未得到充分重视。

Method: 引入StreetMath基准测试，评估大语言模型在非自回归解码器模型中的近似推理能力，特别是在真实世界的数学近似场景下。

Result: 通过对不同LLM架构的广泛评估，我们发现大语言模型通常在需要进行近似推理的任务中仍尝试计算确切值或调用外部工具，并且在解决近似任务时消耗更多的tokens。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在近似算术操作中依赖于相对独立的神经组件，且其推理方式与人类在街头数学中不一样，不体现同样的认知节约。

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

Conclusion: LASTIST数据集为目标独立立场检测和时间演变立场检测任务提供了重要的资源，推动了韩语立场检测研究的发展。

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on

<details>

Motivation: 解决任务特定适配器在推理时引入的显著延迟问题，提高大语言模型的应用效率。

Method: 采用零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），在大语言模型基础上进行适配，同时进行多种规模的实验对比。

Result: 本论文提出了一种新的零延迟融合低秩适配器（zFLoRA），该适配器在大语言模型（LLM）基础上引入了零或可忽略的延迟开销。实验结果表明，zFLoRA在推理时对比基模型（低于1%的额外参数）所引入的计算开销显著降低，尽管这些参数数量看似微不足道。作者在不同任务（包括常识推理、数学推理和摘要对话）上对多种规模的LLM（1B、3B和7B）进行了实验，并在Samsung Galaxy S25+和NVIDIA H100平台上测量了延迟，结果显示zFLoRA适配器几乎没有引入延迟。

Conclusion: zFLoRA适配器在各种任务中表现优越，几乎没有延迟，为任务特定的响应提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在帮助专家克服在多项竞争目标下选择最佳选项的挑战，简化复杂偏好的表达。

Method: 通过两种迭代算法（LISTEN-U和LISTEN-T），LISTEN框架在不同任务上进行优化。

Result: 在航班预订、购物和考试安排等多项任务上评估，LISTEN-U在参数一致性上表现优异，而LISTEN-T则展现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LISTEN框架能够有效减少传统偏好采集的认知负担，并在多目标决策中表现良好。

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文模型在处理长文本时显示出优势，但训练数据中很多缺乏重要的长距离依赖，导致训练效率低下，因此需要有效的数据选择方法。

Method: LongFilter对比长上下文与短上下文的模型预测，评估长距离依赖所提供的信息增益，指导数据选择过程。

Result: 基于LLaMA-3-8B模型的实验表明，LongFilter能够高效筛选高质量数据，显著提升在HELMET、LongBench和RULER等基准上的表现。

Conclusion: LongFilter显著提升了长上下文语言模型的训练效率和性能，特别是在长距离依赖的数据选择方面。

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在内容审核中的广泛使用，理解其在个性化采纳过程中对公平性和中立性影响的合理性和必要性。

Method: 通过比较不同个性化模型在多种内容类型下的表现，分析其对有害内容分类的一致性和公平性影响。

Result: 个性化模型显示出不同的意识形态倾向，导致它们在对有害内容的标记一致性上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，个性化采纳可能会在大型语言模型输出中引入微妙的意识形态偏见，影响内容分类的公平性与一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

Motivation: 解决传统向量数据库方法在处理电子健康记录（EHR）时难以捕捉细微临床关系的问题。

Method: 开发了临床笔记问答评估平台，验证CLEAR方法在零样本大上下文推理和传统块基检索增强生成上的表现。

Result: CLEAR方法在12个临床笔记上测试，胜率为58.3%，语义相似度平均为0.878， 比使用广泛上下文处理减少了78%的标记数。

Conclusion: 实体意识检索方法在临床自然语言处理中的效率和准确性均有所提升，并为评估临床问答系统提供了可重复使用的基准框架。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

Motivation: 在无法检查大型语言模型的训练数据时，了解模型输出的内容以及其对训练数据的记忆显得尤为重要。

Method: RECAP采用反馈驱动的循环，通过初步提取与参考文本对比，识别差异并生成最小纠正提示，以改进后续生成。

Result: 在EchoTrace基准测试中，RECAP在提取版权文本时表现突出，GPT-4.1的平均ROUGE-L评分从0.38提高到0.47，增加近24%。

Conclusion: RECAP显著提高了大型语言模型对版权文本的提取效率，特别是与单次迭代方法相比，ROUGE-L评分大幅提升。

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

Motivation: 探讨多语言数据混合在大型预训练语言模型中的有效性及其对语言覆盖度与模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过训练1.1B和3B参数的语言模型，使用25至400种不同语言的多语言语料库。

Result: 本研究探讨了在预训练大型语言模型(LLMs)时，不同多语言数据混合的影响，尤其是语言覆盖度与模型性能之间的权衡问题。我们训练了1.1B和3B参数的LLMs，使用了不同的多语言语料库，语言数量从25到400不等。研究结果挑战了关于多语言训练的常见看法，发现结合英语和多语言数据并不一定会降低各自语言的性能，只要预训练语料中包含足够的标记。使用英语作为中介语言能够在不同语言家族间带来好处，而选择特定语言家族中的中介语言并不总是能提高该家族中语言的表现。最后，随着训练语言数量的增加，我们未观察到明显的"多语言性诅咒"现象。这表明，恰当平衡的多语言数据可以在不妥协性能的情况下增强语言模型的能力，即使在资源较少的情况下也能实现。

Conclusion: 适当平衡的多语言数据能够提升大型语言模型的能力而不损害性能，即使在低资源语言环境中也效果显著。

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

Result: 发现机器翻译系统在翻译过程中导致标签漂移，尤其在文化敏感领域显著；现代大语言模型在编码文化知识方面表现出更强的标签漂移特征；源语言和目标语言之间的文化相似性或差异性是标签保持的关键因素。

Conclusion: 忽视文化因素会导致标签准确性下降，并可能引发误解和文化冲突。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂数学推理中的不可靠性和验证机制缺失问题

Method: 引入SymCode框架进行可验证代码生成

Result: 在MATH-500和OlympiadBench基准测试中，SymCode显著提高了准确率，提升幅度高达13.6个百分点

Conclusion: SymCode通过将大型语言模型推理与确定性符号引擎结合，为更准确和可信的AI打下基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

Result: 本文提出了一种针对Amazon Web Services（AWS）开发的AI加速器Trainium的高性能矩阵乘法（matmul）设计，旨在优化大规模语言模型（LLM）的推理过程。通过结合内核融合和新颖的缓存策略，研究减少了软件管理内存层次结构中的数据移动，最大化了SRAM带宽，并避免了昂贵的矩阵转置操作。评估结果显示，本文的系统在训练和推理过程中显著优于AWS的最新状态，达到了平均1.35倍的加速，最终实现了平均1.66倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发出高性能的矩阵乘法算法，大幅提升了Trainium上的LLM推理速度，展示了Trainium架构的潜力。

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

TL;DR: 本论文提出了AttnCache框架，以提高大型语言模型在预填充推理阶段的性能，通过缓存类似的注意力图实现速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于许多实际工作负载只依赖于预填充阶段而不进行自回归解码，因此需要一种优化方法来提升该阶段的计算效率，减轻自注意力计算成为性能瓶颈的问题。

Method: 该方法基于观察到的相似性，建立一个注意力图记忆数据库，利用缓存和相似性搜索技术来识别和重用预缓存的注意力图。

Result: 本论文提出了一种名为AttnCache的框架，旨在加速大型语言模型（LLMs）在只执行预填充阶段推理时的性能。研究发现，不同语义的句子在各层和各头部的注意力图往往相似，因此可通过缓存和重用相似的注意力图来减少自注意力计算的开销。实验表明，AttnCache在CPU和GPU上均显著加速了推理速度，且几乎没有准确性损失。

Conclusion: 通过AttnCache框架，可以有效减少自注意力计算的开销，提升大语言模型的推理效率，同时保持准确性基本不变。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练框架SRL，用于解决小规模开放源码大语言模型在多步骤推理中的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模开放源码模型在多步骤推理中所面临的挑战，特别是现有方法的局限性。

Method: 通过将问题解决重新表述为生成逻辑“动作”的序列，训练模型在每个动作之前生成内部推理独白。

Result: SRL提供了基于专家动作的更丰富学习信号，即使在所有回合都是错误时也能鼓励灵活推理，最终提升模型性能。

Conclusion: SRL能够让小规模模型学习SFT或RLVR难以掌握的复杂问题，并在软件工程任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了PORTool，一种通过强化学习提高工具使用语言模型在动态环境中探索不同工具调用路径的能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具使用大语言模型在动态环境中表现有限，缺乏探索不同解决方案的能力。

Method: 使用强化学习鼓励模型生成多个工具调用路径，并为每一步分配基于其成功率的奖励。

Result: 在使用17种工具的实验中，PORTool展现出显著的准确性和工具调用步骤改善。

Conclusion: 实验表明，PORTool在准确性和工具调用步骤方面均显著优于其他训练方法。

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

Conclusion: 通过不同模型层的有针对性激活引导，手术引导方法克服了当前对齐技术的限制，实现知识转移与文化本地化之间的更好平衡。

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Method: 通过回顾性队列研究，使用基于变换器的自然语言处理管道从影像学报告中识别ITFs并提取结节特征。

Result: 在115,683名成人中，发现7.8%的ITFs，主要为结节，且与甲状腺活检、手术和癌症诊断有关，为确诊及后续管理的复杂性增添了挑战。

Conclusion: 意外甲状腺发现在影像学中常见，并与小型低风险癌症的检测级联反应紧密相关，表明需标准化报告和更具选择性的随访。

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在代码生成中的应用增加，量子编程作为一个需要与硬件设备互动的领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 我们开发了一个评估框架QCoder Benchmark，支持在量子模拟环境中评估LLMs，并使用来自编程竞赛的人类编写代码进行比较。

Result: 我们发布了QCoder Benchmark数据集和公共评估API，以支持进一步的研究。

Conclusion: 我们的实验表明，在量子编程基准上，先进的模型如GPT-4o的准确率仅为18.97%，而基于推理的模型o3达到了78%的准确率，超越了人类编写代码的平均成功率（39.98%）。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

Motivation: 提高大型语言模型的推理能力的同时，解决模型输出多样性不足的问题。

Method: 通过引入Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) 度量，策划多样化的解决方案集，并对模型进行微调以测试其有效性。

Result: 提出了一种新的训练范式1PNS，能够增加推理输出的多样性，并通过RPD度量推理路径的差异，从而提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 1PNS训练方法有效提升了模型输出的多样性和性能，验证了TTS技术的增强效果。

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了六种话语关系在说服文本中的重要性，尤其是在使用特定说服技巧时的作用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

Conclusion: 通过引入SDM激活层，本研究提高了语言模型在指令响应中的生成效果，并减少了模型的放弃率。

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 当前的LLM评估往往依赖单一指令模板，忽视了指令风格的敏感性，而这对于真实世界的应用至关重要。

Method: 通过系统性地将基准问题转化为多种指令风格，评估模型在这些不同风格下的响应表现。

Result: 实验表明，指令风格可能导致准确率最高变化达16.7个百分点，且指令风格的一致性与任务准确率具有很强的相关性。

Conclusion: RCScore提供了一种有原则的方法来评估指令的稳健性，强调了指令风格对模型表现的影响。

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

TL;DR: 本研究提出Token Timestep Allocation方法以解决扩散语言模型的更新遗忘问题，通过时间步调度实现标记的软性排序，提高了模型的可控性和流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型在实际控制过程中存在的更新遗忘问题，提高模型的可控性与生成文本的流畅性。

Method: 提出Token Timestep Allocation（TTA），实现每个标记的时间步调度，区分关键标记和不确定标记的处理方式。

Result: 本研究探讨了扩散语言模型（DLMs）在实际可控性方面的脆弱性，识别并正式描述了一种主要的失效模式——更新遗忘。研究表明，均匀且与上下文无关的更新会导致时间步的标记级波动，从而抹去早期的语义编辑，破坏累积细化过程，降低语言流畅性和连贯性。为了解决这一问题，提出了一个新的方法——Token Timestep Allocation（TTA），通过每个标记的时间步调度实现软性和语义的标记排序。TTA的实施可以是固定策略或基于任务信号的自适应策略。这种方法在推理阶段进行，无论是对不同的DLMs，还是在不同的监督来源中均适用。实验结果表明，TTA不仅提高了可控性和流畅性，在情感控制任务中，准确率提高了20%以上，困惑度减少近一半；在去毒化任务中，最大毒性和困惑度均有显著降低。这表明，通过时间步调配实现的软性排序是减轻更新遗忘、实现稳定和可控文本生成的关键因素。

Conclusion: TTA通过时间步调配有效缓解了更新遗忘问题，显著提升了扩散文本生成的稳定性和可控性。

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG通过多工具协作框架有效提高了全球RAG任务的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 探讨如何提高语言模型理解隐含意义的能力，特别是通过实用理论的提示来实现有效的上下文学习。

Method: 提出了一种将实用理论概述作为提示的方法，通过逐步推理过程指导语言模型理解隐含意义。

Result: 研究表明，使用实用理论作为提示显著提高语言模型在隐含意义理解任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 使用实用理论提示可以显著增强语言模型的推理能力，即使仅提及这些理论的名称也能带来性能提升。

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 研究发现预训练语言模型在区分借用词和本土词汇方面表现不佳，表明其对借用词存在偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言模型是否具备识别借用词的能力，以及这一能力对少数语言和语言保护的影响。

Method: 通过评估多个预训练语言模型在10种语言中的表现，研究借用词的识别能力。

Result: 这篇论文探讨了预训练语言模型在识别借用词方面的能力，特别是在双语社区中，这些社区的主要语言通常会对少数语言施加词汇压力。研究表明，尽管给出明确的指示和上下文信息，多种模型在区分借用词与本土词汇方面的表现仍然较差。这些发现支持了现代自然语言处理系统对借用词存在偏见的观点，且对发展少数语言的 NLP 工具和支持语言保护具有重要意义。

Conclusion: 现代自然语言处理系统在辨别借用词与本土词汇方面存在显著局限，影响了少数语言的保护和工具开发。

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Method: 控制性实证研究，比较五种知识蒸馏方法在CLIP和SigLIP2上的表现，评估其在特定任务中的有效性。

Result: 通过对五种蒸馏方法的系统研究，发现某些配置能够在减少模型大小的同时，保持或提升多语言检索的稳健性，而其他配置则未能维持跨任务的稳定性。

Conclusion: 整体准确率并不能揭示设计中的敏感权衡，必须考虑不同蒸馏配置的具体影响。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

Motivation: 希望找到更可靠的内部信号，以提升大型语言模型在生成过程中的推理能力，并克服传统方法对外部信号的依赖。

Method: 通过分析神经元激活行为，提出了一种新的无监督方法NAD，该方法通过激活稀疏性和交叉样本神经元一致性选择候选答案。

Result: NAD在数学和科学基准测试中与多数投票相匹配，在无法应用多数投票的开放式编码基准测试中，NAD的表现 consistently 优于Avg@64，并且通过早期修剪无前景轨迹，减少了99%的token使用。

Conclusion: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD)通过利用内部信号，实现了更高效和准确的无标签解码，显著降低了生成过程中的token使用，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

Motivation: 解释大型语言模型在处理数字信息时的表现矛盾，并量化其准确性的下限。

Method: 通过定量分析不同语言模型的数字处理机制，探索它们的准确性下限及其在隐藏状态和输入背景下的系统化表示。

Result: 本研究揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在处理数字信息时的表现和潜能。尽管这些模型在输出时常出现错误，但它们学习到的数字表示却是高度准确且系统化的，表现出强大的互换性和通用性。通过探究这些模型对数字的操作机制，我们能够识别出特定层导致输出错误的原因，并为每个LLM创建通用探测器，从而为进一步改进LLM架构指明方向。

Conclusion: 本研究为我们理解预训练LLM如何操作数字提供了基础，同时指出了改进LLM架构的潜在路径。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

Result: 8B-SCRIBE模型在相关性和可行性等关键维度上与大型模型的质量相当或更优，且学生对其感知与大模型相当。

Conclusion: SCRIBE框架通过结合领域特定工具与自反推理管道，提供了有效的学生反馈生成方案，证明了其在低资源和隐私敏感教育应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在经济学和心理学等专业领域表现不佳，通常需要深入的原则性理解，ACER旨在解决这一问题，提高模型在这些领域的表现。

Method: ACER通过生成课程大纲和根据布鲁姆分类法生成问答对，构建综合的教材式课程，以实现系统性主题覆盖和逐渐增加的难度，进行持续预训练。

Result: 在微观经济学等困难领域，ACER使准确率提高了5个百分点，并在所有目标领域观察到宏观平均改进3个百分点，同时在非目标领域也实现了交叉知识转移。

Conclusion: ACER是一种可扩展且有效的方法，可以缩小大型语言模型在专业领域与一般任务之间的差距。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，目前的LLMs在教育应用中仍然存在显著的提升空间，特别是在培养能力方面。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Conclusion: SSLC提供了一种高效的大语言模型部署方案，兼顾了性能和计算资源的优化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

Result: 本文介绍了DIVRIT，一个用于希伯来文元音符号化的创新系统。它将此任务视为零样本分类问题，从动态生成的候选集中为每个没有元音符号的单词选择最合适的元音符号化模式。DIVRIT的一个关键创新是使用希伯来视觉语言模型，将没有元音符号的文本处理为图像，使得元音符号信息能够直接嵌入输入的向量表示中。通过对多种配置的全面评估，研究表明该系统能够有效地进行元音符号化，而无需复杂的显式语言分析。在“oracle”设置下，DIVRIT在候选集中保证正确的元音符号形式，展现出高水平的准确性。此外，系统的架构和优化训练方法的战略增强显著提升了整体泛化能力。这些发现强调了视觉表示在自动化希伯来元音符号化中的前景。

Conclusion: DIVRIT系统可以有效实现希伯来文的自动元音符号化，并展示了视觉表示的潜力。

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

Result: 发现线性映射提取的是反复出现的、粗粒度的语义属性，而非独立的关系，这使得解码器具有较高的压缩性。

Conclusion: 线性关系解码在变换器语言模型中主要是基于属性的，而不是特定关系的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

Result: 本研究提出了一种名为CAST的动态树解码方法，旨在解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理时面临的延迟挑战。该方法通过综合考虑果GPU配置和批处理大小等因素，动态调整树结构，从而优化推理成本。实验结果表明，CAST的速度比传统解码方法快最多5.2倍，并且在多个任务中表现优于现有的最先进技术，提升幅度达到5%至20%。

Conclusion: CAST动态树解码方法显著提高了LLMs的推理速度和效率，且表现优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

Method: 对RedLLM和DecLLM进行全面比较，使用不同规模的预训练模型，并在指令调优后评估其性能和效率。

Result: RedLLM与DecLLM在不同模型规模下进行比较，显示出RedLLM在扩展性和任务性能上的优势。

Conclusion: RedLLM在多项下游任务上表现出与DecLLM相当甚至更好的效果，且推理效率显著提高。

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree框架通过高质量规则改善低资源领域适应，医疗问答表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数据敏感领域（如医疗）中缺乏高质量、特定领域训练语料的问题

Method: 提出Evontree框架，利用高质量的本体规则来提取、验证和增强领域知识

Result: 在医疗问答基准上进行广泛实验，显示出优于未修改模型和领先的监督基线，准确率提高了最多3.7%

Conclusion: Evontree证明了在低资源领域中增强LLMs的有效性、效率和稳健性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear是一种新型混合线性注意力架构，首次在多个场景中超越完整注意力机制，展示了更高的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个高效的混合线性注意力架构，以便在多个上下文和RL扩展范畴中超越传统的完整注意力机制。

Method: 使用Kimi Delta Attention（KDA）模块及定制的chunkwise算法，结合3B激活参数和48B总参数的Kimi Linear模型进行预训练。

Result: Kimi Linear在相同训练条件下，显著优于全MLA，同时KV缓存使用量减少高达75%，解码吞吐量最高可达6倍。

Conclusion: Kimi Linear在众多场景下优于完整注意力机制，显示出卓越的性能和效率，尤其适用于长输入和输出长度的任务。

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的解码过程依赖于手动调节超参数，限制了生成的灵活性和效率。

Method: 在标准变压器上增加轻量级头部，动态预测上下文特定的温度和top-p值，并与下一标记的logits一起输出。

Result: AutoDeco在八个基准测试上表现优异，且其性能与经过专业调优的基线相当，同时展现了通过自然语言指令控制解码的能力。

Conclusion: AutoDeco通过学习自我调节解码策略，显著提升了LLM的生成性能，开启了可操控和交互式解码的新范式。

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在社会中扮演的角色越来越重要，如何使其与人类价值观对齐成为一个关键研究领域。

Method: 通过实验分析Llama-3和Qwen-3模型，评估不同规模的模型在后期训练中的价值观对齐，考察监控偏好优化算法和数据集的效果。

Result: 本研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)与人类价值观的对齐问题，重点分析其在后期训练阶段的动态过程。通过对不同规模的Llama-3和Qwen-3模型进行实验，研究发现，监督微调(SFT)阶段通常确立模型的价值观，而后续的偏好优化则很少重新对齐这些价值观。此外，使用合成偏好数据集，研究显示不同的偏好优化算法会导致不同的价值观对齐结果，即使在偏好数据保持不变的情况下。

Conclusion: 研究结果为如何在后期训练中学习价值观提供了可操作的见解，并为数据选择、模型和算法的优化提供了指导，以改善与人类价值观的对齐。

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数学基准测试无法有效评估高性能的大型语言模型（LLM），因此需要一个新的、具有更高难度的数学推理基准。

Method: AMO-Bench包含50个经过专家交叉验证、完全原创的数学问题，问题只要求最终答案，便于自动评分和评估。

Result: AMO-Bench在26个大型语言模型上进行了实验测试，结果显示即使是表现最好的模型在AMO-Bench上也仅获得52.4%的准确率，多数模型的得分甚至低于40%。

Conclusion: AMO-Bench展示了现有大型语言模型在数学推理方面的不足，并提供了一个新的平台，以促进对语言模型推理能力的进一步研究。

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习面临模态不平衡和数据噪声的主要挑战，这影响了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: CAL基于模态贡献度量，结合信息量和置信度，设计了不对称梯度加速机制和贡献感知的压缩机制。

Result: 提出了一种创新的模态压缩范式，即贡献引导的不对称学习（CAL），显著提升了多模态信息融合的性能。

Conclusion: CAL在模态不平衡和噪声干扰方面显示出显著优势，是一个灵活高效的框架，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces two major challenges: modality imbalance and data
noise, which significantly affect the robustness and generalization ability of
models. Existing methods achieve modality balance by suppressing dominant
modalities, but they neglect the inherent differences in the information value
between modalities, potentially leading to convergence to suboptimal solutions.
This paper proposes an innovative modality compression paradigm,
Contribution-Guided Asymmetric Learning (CAL), which aims to enhance the
contribution of high-contribution modalities while compressing weak modalities
to increase their contribution, allowing both to improve the performance of
multimodal information fusion. CAL is based on a modality contribution metric
W^m combining the information quantity I(m) and confidence D(m), and it designs
an asymmetric gradient acceleration mechanism and a contribution-aware
Asymmetric Information Bottleneck (AIB) compression mechanism. The former
accelerates the gradient update of modalities, while the latter dynamically
compresses the noise of low-contribution modalities.
  On five benchmark datasets, including emotion recognition, scene recognition,
and event localization tasks, CAL has shown outstanding performance in
imbalanced fusion tasks and noise robustness tests. On CREMA-D, KS, and AVE,
CAL achieves 79.30%, 74.82%, and 74.21% accuracy, significantly outperforming
the existing state-of-the-art model ARL. In high-noise robustness tests, CAL
also achieved leading performance under various attack strategies on the
MVSA-Single and NYUD2 datasets. These results validate the significant
advantages of CAL in modality imbalance and noise interference. CAL, as a
flexible and efficient framework, is easy to transfer to other tasks and has
broad adaptability and potential application prospects.

Motivation: 探讨可穿戴传感器中时间分辨率对预测效用的影响，并提出一种新的分析方法。

Method: 引入HiMAE，自监督框架结合了掩蔽自编码与层次化卷积编码解码器，以实现多分辨率嵌入。

Result: HiMAE在分类、回归和生成基准测试中表现优异，相比现有模型在尺寸上更小，且能够在智能手表等设备上快速推理。

Conclusion: HiMAE作为一种高效的自监督学习方法，对可穿戴健康数据中的尺度敏感结构进行探索，显示出其在不同任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Motivation: 理解链式思维如何提高变换器的表现及其学习过程中的动态特性。

Method: 以符号推理任务为基础，调整任务复杂度和数据组成，通过两种训练设置来研究学习动态。

Result: 该研究探讨了链式思维（CoT）在训练变换器模型中的作用，尤其是在符号推理任务上。通过调整算法复杂度和数据组成，对两种训练设置进行比较：一种只输出最终答案，另一种在输出前生成CoT推理步骤。研究发现，尽管CoT通常会提升任务表现，但其效果受任务复杂度的影响。结果显示，模型的学习速度和形态与任务复杂度、数据分布以及CoT监督的有无密切相关。此外，早期训练阶段，模型常常可以给出正确答案，但在CoT步骤上可能存在不一致，后期则逐渐调整推理轨迹与答案一致。总的来说，该研究揭示了CoT协助加速模型泛化的潜力，但在更复杂的任务中，例如查找列表交集，难以突破。

Conclusion: 链式思维加速了模型泛化，但在面临更高算法复杂度的任务时仍然面临挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Conclusion: MemEIC在复杂的多模态问题上显著提高了性能，并有效保留先前的编辑，成为CCKE的新基准。

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Conclusion: FreLE算法通过频率正则化提高模型泛化能力，并在多个实验中显示出优越性能。

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

TL;DR: PRESTO是一种新颖的指令优化框架，通过利用软提示的预映像结构，实现了在相同查询预算下优化效率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何优化黑箱大语言模型的指令，利用预映像结构克服以往方法中的效率低下。

Method: 引入PREimage-informed inSTruction Optimization (PRESTO)框架，包含评分共享、基于预映像的初始化和评分一致性正则化三部分。

Result: 在33个指令优化任务中，PRESTO表现出色，显著提高了优化效率。

Conclusion: PRESTO利用预映像结构高效优化指令，相较于其他方法在相同查询预算下获得了14倍更多的评分数据，实验结果表明其优越的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

TL;DR: ScaleDiff是一个高效的框架，可以在无额外训练的情况下扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，使用Neighborhood Patch Attention机制和Latent Frequency Mixing。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在生成超出训练分辨率的图像时性能下降的问题，特别是在计算需求高或不兼容最新的扩散变换器模型的情况下。

Method: 提出一个无模型依赖且高效的框架（ScaleDiff）来扩展预训练扩散模型的分辨率，而无需额外训练。

Result: ScaleDiff在图像质量和推理速度方面，在训练无关的方法中表现出了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff在U-Net和扩散变换器架构上显示出卓越的性能，提供高质量的图像和快速的推理，证明了其在训练无关方法中的优势。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了\pi_{RL}框架，利用在线强化学习显著提升流基VLA的性能和泛化能力，通过两个RL算法开展强化学习探讨。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有研究探索了使用强化学习（RL）来自动化数据收集过程以扩展监督微调（SFT），但在流基VLA上应用大规模RL仍存在挑战，尤其是因迭代去噪而导致的不可处理的行动对数似然。

Method: \pi_{RL}实现了两个RL算法：Flow-Noise和Flow-SDE，分别通过建模去噪过程和整合智能体-环境交互来实现标准化的RL探索。

Result: 在LIBERO和ManiSkill基准上评估\pi_{RL}，结果显示其在少样本SFT上与\pi_0及\pi_{0.5}的提升幅度分别达到了57.6%至97.6%和77.1%至98.3%。在处理4352个任务的情况下，\pi_0和\pi_{0.5}也得到了分别41.6%至85.7%和40.0%至84.8%的提升。

Conclusion: 整体而言，\pi_{RL}在流基VLA上实现了显著的性能提升和更强的泛化能力，验证了在线RL的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

Method: 图论拓扑方法

Result: 通过Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC)提出的核心集构建算法选择代表性初始标签，并通过数据驱动的停止标准确定探索的足够性。引入局部图重连策略提升标签传播效率，保留稀疏性。实验表明，在低标签率下，该方法优于现有图基半监督基线。

Conclusion: 实验结果证明了所提方法在低标签率下的有效性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的任务驱动表示方法，显著提升了在复杂数据池中的主动学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最先进方法在处理复杂数据池时效果不佳，因为它们依赖于固定的无监督表示，未能捕获与任务相关的重要信息。

Method: 提出两种特定的策略来学习任务驱动的表示，一种是基于半监督学习，另一种是基于对初始无监督表示的监督微调。

Result: 通过定期更新任务驱动的表示，结合以前收集的标签，显著提高了主动学习的实证表现。

Conclusion: 采用任务驱动的表示方法可以显著提高主动学习在复杂数据池上的表现。

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

Result: 提出的MLT方法在性能上与监督嵌入相当，但参数数量和训练成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，MLT在处理数百万标识符时能够保持可逆性，同时在资源需求上更具优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub

Result: 三种GeoFM嵌入源的综合模型在87%的指标上超越了传统地理统计方法，总体预测表现良好。

Conclusion: 多种GeoFM来源的整合为增强常规健康信息系统提供了一种高效且有价值的工具。

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

<details>

Motivation: 指出现有InfoNCE作为MI估计的有效性不足，并寻求更准确的估计方法。

Method: 引入辅助锚类改进InfoNCE，并通过正确的评分规则进行了框架推广。

Result: 本文揭示了InfoNCE目标在 mutual information (MI) 估计中的不足之处，并提出了一种改进的方法——InfoNCE-anchor，以更准确地进行MI估计。改进方法引入了辅助锚类，确保了一致的密度比估计，并显著降低了偏差。此外，作者拓展了框架，使用正确的评分规则统一了广泛的对比目标。实验证明，使用log评分的InfoNCE-anchor在MI估计中表现最佳，但在自监督表示学习中，锚类并未提升下游任务的性能。

Conclusion: 对比表征学习的优点在于学习结构化密度比，而非单纯的准确MI估计。

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

Motivation: 研究在全适应性探索方法和纯贪婪策略之间的差距，以应对不频繁探索的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为INFEX的框架，该框架根据给定时间表执行基本的探索策略，同时在两次探索之间主要选择贪婪动作。

Result: INFEX达到了与标准高效算法相匹配的实例相关遗憾，并在理论分析和实证评估中显示出优越的性能和运行时改进。

Conclusion: INFEX框架通过在较少的时间点进行探索并在其他时间点选择贪婪动作，能够在保证性能的同时提高计算效率，为线性强盗问题提供了一种新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

Conclusion: 本文提出的双重MoE方法在METABRIC和GBSG乳腺癌数据集上显著提升了生存分析的预测性能。

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Method: 通过分析一个270M参数的变换器在棋局中的表现，比较不同层次的概念编码精度，并引入Chess960数据集测试概念的稳健性。

Result: 初层捕捉人类概念准确度高达85%，但深层层次尽管性能优越，其概念识别能力下降至50-65%；通过Chess960数据集，模型在消除开局理论后概念识别下降10-20%。

Conclusion: AI系统在优化性能的过程中，逐渐发展出与人类思维背离的智能形式，这为需要真正人机协作的创意AI应用带来了挑战。

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: 本研究的发现为理解知识蒸馏的工作机制及设计更好的去偏方法提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

TL;DR: Nirvana 是一种新型的专门通才模型，具有特殊的记忆机制和线性时间复杂度，能在不同任务中灵活调整以实现高效的性能，特别是在医学图像处理任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在结合广泛能力与专家级绩效，于是开发了Nirvana，以弥补传统大语言模型在专门领域表现的不足。

Method: 采用创新的专门记忆机制和任务感知记忆触发（Trigger）机制，使模型在处理任务时具备自我调整参数的能力。

Result: 实验结果显示Nirvana在多种自然语言建模基准上表现竞争力，并在MRI任务中实现高质量重建和精准的临床报告生成。

Conclusion: Nirvana模型在自然语言任务和医学任务上均表现出卓越的性能，特别是在MRI重建和临床报告生成方面，优于传统模型。

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用大语言模型的多阶段管道以提高漏洞引入提交识别的准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的二分法识别存在多个障碍，限制了其准确性和有效性。

Method: 提出一种综合性的多阶段管道，利用大语言模型（LLMs）来识别引入漏洞的提交（BIC）。

Result: 通过采用LLMs，我们的方法在准确性上比当前最先进的解决方案提高了超过38%，且比基于LLMs的基本方法提高了60%。

Conclusion: 综合性的多阶段管道是提高漏洞识别准确性的重要手段。

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SAFE工具，通过对模型预测进行分层评估，揭示了不同地理和社会属性对气候和天气预测模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的模型性能评估方法未能考虑人类发展和地理分布的不均匀性，导致对气候预测模型性能的理解不够全面。

Method: 通过开发SAFE工具，整合多种数据领域，并按照地域属性对气象模型的预测能力进行分层评估。

Result: 该论文提出了一种名为SAFE的工具，用于评估气候和天气模型在地球不同地理层次上的预测表现。通过考虑人类发展的非均匀分布，SAFE能够根据不同的属性（如国家、全球子区域、收入和土地覆盖）对预测结果进行分层分析。该研究使用SAFE对多种先进的气象预测模型进行基准测试，发现它们在各属性上的预测能力存在显著差异。这标志着在气候变量预测公正性方面迈出了重要一步。

Conclusion: SAFE工具使研究者能够更细致地评估气象模型的表现，并寻求提高模型公平性的途径。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

TL;DR: 本文提出LTE方法，通过利用LLMs之前自生成的错误答案，显著提高其解决问题的能力，克服了现有RLVR方法的探索停滞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RLVR方法在探索过程中停滞的问题，提高LLMs的推理能力。

Method: 提出LTE方法，利用LLMs之前自生成的错误答案进行训练，无需外部专家指导。

Result: 实验结果显示，LTE在多个数学基准上相较于常规GRPO平均提高了6.38的Pass@1和9.00的Pass@k。

Conclusion: LTE方法有效改善了LLMs的学习能力，并在多个数学基准上表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

TL;DR: 本研究提出的maxVSTAR能够在隐私保护的环境中自适应地提升基于WiFi CSI的人体活动识别精度，展示了其在动态环境下的在线模型适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WiFi CSI的人体活动识别在部署于边缘设备时因领域迁移而引起的性能下降问题。

Method: maxVSTAR通过闭环的视觉引导模型适配框架，利用YOLO模型提供实时活动标签，对CSI数据流进行在线微调。

Result: maxVSTAR在未经校准硬件上的实验中，从初始的93.52%的识别准确率下降到49.14%，经过一次视觉引导的适应周期后，识别准确率恢复至81.51%。

Conclusion: maxVSTAR展示了在隐私保护的物联网环境中，如何有效实现基于WiFi CSI的人体活动识别的动态自适应能力。

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

Result: MolBridge 是一种新颖的分子-文本学习框架，通过子结构感知对齐增强了分子信息的理解。它通过在分子描述对中增加从分子子结构和化学短语引出的对齐信号，提升了模型对细微区别的捕捉能力。MolBridge 采用对比学习与自我精炼机制，实现了有效的细粒度对齐，并在多项分子基准测试中超过了现有模型。

Conclusion: MolBridge 通过子结构感知的对齐机制显著改进了分子-文本学习，并在多项基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Conclusion: 在高度不平衡和时间不确定的数据场景中，模型简单性结合优化分段能够超越更复杂的架构。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

Result: 在两个现实数据集上评估结果显示GSTRL的优越性能。

Conclusion: GSTRL框架在现实世界数据集上表现优越，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>

Motivation: 随着数据驱动的AI的发展，精确的样本影响估计变得越来越重要，但标准方法不足以有效处理训练中的跨周期累积效应。

Method: 提出了一种轨迹感知的估计器ACC-SGD-IE，通过在训练过程中传播留一法扰动并在每一步更新累积影响状态。

Result: ACC-SGD-IE在多种数据集上测试，包括Adult、20 Newsgroups和MNIST，结果显示其在影响估计上更为准确，尤其在处理长周期训练时效果显著。

Conclusion: ACC-SGD-IE在影响估计的准确性上优于SGD-IE，特别在长训练周期内，对于数据清洗任务更有效。

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

Conclusion: 随机森林模型表现最佳，可用于识别导致再住院的关键因素，有助于减少再住院可能性，提高医疗质量并降低成本。

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

Conclusion: AISP 方法有效提高了大语言模型在测试时间的对齐性能，从而减少了对高昂计算成本的需求。

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上的输出与完全重训练模型相似，同时显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法在实际应用中有效解决了现有机器注销技术的可扩展性问题，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全和可靠的人工智能部署中，控制大型语言模型的特定行为同时保持其一般能力是一个核心挑战。

Method: 将行为调节公式化为朝向或远离目标行为方向的几何旋转，提出了自适应角度调节的选择变体，只旋转与目标特征对齐的激活，进一步增强稳定性和一致性。

Result: 引入了Angular Steering，一种通过在固定的二维子空间中旋转激活值来实现行为调节的灵活新方法。

Conclusion: Angular Steering在多个模型家族和规模上的实验表明，它能在保持语言建模性能的同时实现稳健的行为控制，体现了其灵活性、广泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

Conclusion: 我们的插值方案在多个模型和数据集上显示出相较基线方法的优势，能够更好地遍历高密度区域。

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

TL;DR: 本论文研究了离线偏好学习中的用户偏好聚类问题，提出了两种算法应对数据不平衡和样本噪声的挑战，并通过模拟验证了理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户交互有限或成本较高时，离线偏好学习变得必要，而现实世界中的偏好学习通常涉及具有不同偏好的用户。

Method: 研究了在离线情况下如何通过用户间的相似性聚合数据，并通过主动选择样本来对付数据不平衡问题。

Result: 提出了Off-C$^2$PL和A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL两种算法，分别针对纯离线设置和主动数据增强情境，以提高测试用户的效用。

Conclusion: 离线偏好学习面临用户偏好差异和数据不平衡的问题，提出的算法在有效性方面超越传统方法。

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Motivation: 探讨CLIP在处理对象、属性和关系的组合推理时的不足，并针对现有模型不能有效解释这一现象的问题提供解决方案。

Method: 建立了一种基于标记的因果表示学习框架，扩展了块可识别性理论，并证明了CLIP的对比目标可以在句子级和标记级SCM下恢复模态不变的潜变量。

Result: 提出了一种基于顺序语言标记的因果表示学习框架，该框架能够更好地理解和改进CLIP的组合推理能力。

Conclusion: CLIP在组合推理上的不足源于标记级别的组合非可识别性，而通过改进负样本挖掘策略可以提升其性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 响应数据存储和重放对隐私和安全限制的挑战，探索数据无关的持续学习方法。

Method: 提出逐层模型反演（PMI）以提高反演的效率，利用高斯分布对类特征建模，确保合成与真实特征的对齐。

Result: 本文探讨了持续学习（CL）的核心目标，即在不丢失对先前任务性能的情况下，逐步训练模型以应对新任务。由于隐私和安全的限制，存储和重放数据往往不可行，因此提出了数据无关的持续学习方法，旨在不依赖于以往数据更新模型。通过模型反演合成数据，从而实现重放功能，而不需要存储样本。本文还指出了模型反演在预测模型中面临的两个主要挑战：一是仅从压缩的输出标签生成输入会导致合成和真实数据之间的漂移，重放此类数据可能会侵蚀先前的知识；二是反演计算成本高昂，特别是在大规模模型如CLIP中。为提升效率，本文提出了逐层模型反演（PMI），通过对单层优化中更快收敛的灵感，PMI为全模型反演提供了强初始化，显著减少了迭代次数。同时，本文通过高斯分布建模类特征并对比模型，减轻特征偏移，确保合成特征与真实特征之间的对齐。结合PMI和特征建模，本文提出的方法通过生成伪图像，从语义感知的投影特征中有效进行新类的持续学习，在多种CL设置中取得了良好的效果和兼容性。

Conclusion: 通过结合逐层模型反演和高斯特征建模，本文的方法在不断学习新任务时表现出良好的效果，且适应多种持续学习环境。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

Method: 将支持向量机(SVM)训练表述为二次无约束优化(QUBO)问题，利用量子退火进行模型优化。

Result: 低精度的QUBO编码能够实现竞争力的分类准确率，并且增加比特深度并不总是能改善分类性能。

Conclusion: 选择合适的支持向量可能比参数的精确权重更为重要，量子退火有潜力提升SVM训练效率。

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

Result: 在仅需$L^4$界限的得分误差的情况下，结合扩散模型和退火Langevin动态实现了多项式时间的条件采样。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与Langevin动态的结合在后验采样上具有优势，能够在多项式时间内处理条件采样问题。

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对突发平流层加热（SSWs）进行准确和高效的预报是一项持续挑战。现有数值天气预报（NWP）系统在物理表征、初始化和计算需求方面存在局限性，而数据驱动的预报方法在复杂的SSWs动力学中尚未充分应用，尤其是在概率预报方面。

Method: 使用FM-Cast模型对1998年至2024年间18个主要SSW事件进行了评估，该模型能在20天内成功预测10个事件的发生、强度和形态，其表现优于50%的集合准确率，并在消费级GPU上仅需两分钟进行50成员、30天的预报。

Result: 开发了一种基于流匹配的生成式AI模型（FM-Cast），能够高效而精准地对平流层环流的时空演变进行概率预报。

Conclusion: FM-Cast模型不仅提供了高效的SSW概率预报，还加深了对大气气候动力学的理解，促进了相关科学工具的发展。

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep

Conclusion: CoLA-World成功实现了联合学习，匹配或超越了先前的两阶段方法，在视频仿真质量和后续视觉规划上表现优异，建立了该领域新范式。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: MRGC通过流形学习增强图凝缩的鲁棒性，确保在对抗攻击下的分类能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图凝缩方法在原始图受到扰动时性能下降明显，且现有的鲁棒图学习技术效果有限，急需改进鲁棒性。

Method: 提出一种新的流形约束鲁棒图凝缩框架（MRGC），采用流形学习模块优化图凝缩过程。

Result: 通过引入三种图数据流形学习模块，MRGC能使凝缩图保持在平滑、低维流形中，并最小化类别歧义。

Conclusion: MRGC能有效提升图凝缩的鲁棒性，维护分类复杂性降低的能力，适应各种对抗攻击场景。

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: ReSpec通过调节SD配置、演化drafter和按回滚奖励加权更新，使投机解码更有效地集成到RL中，显著提升了训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨如何有效地将投机解码(SD)集成到强化学习(RL)中，以提高大型语言模型(LLMs)的训练效率。

Method: 通过动态调整SD配置，利用知识蒸馏演化drafter，并根据回滚奖励加权更新。

Result: ReSpec系统在Qwen模型上实现了高达4.5倍的加速，同时保持奖励收敛和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ReSpec提供了一种实用的解决方案，可以有效地加速基于RL的大型语言模型适应过程。

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Motivation: 现有的数据选择方法缺乏理论支持和广泛适应性，本文旨在提供一种更为有效和可验证的方法来提升RLVR的性能。

Method: 使用影响函数进行数据选择，通过离线轨迹的影响估计和稀疏随机投影来管理高维梯度，最终形成CROPI框架。

Result: 本文提出了一种基于影响函数的理论方法，用于改进强化学习中具有可验证奖励（RLVR）的数据选择，进而提升大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力。通过离线影响估计和稀疏随机投影技术，研究人员开发了CROPI框架，显著加速了训练过程，并减少了数据使用量。

Conclusion: 影响基础的数据选择在强化学习中具有显著的潜力，可以有效提升大型语言模型的训练速度和效率。

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

Motivation: 为了解决资源受限环境中深度学习模型面临的OOD数据带来的可靠性挑战，探索无监督异常检测的应用。

Method: 比较了六种UAD方法，包括Deep SVDD等，评估其在PTB-XL和BUT QDB数据集上的表现。

Result: 本研究探讨了一种无监督异常检测（UAD）作为滤波机制，以提高深度学习模型在资源受限环境下的可靠性。研究比较了六种UAD方法在心血管疾病（CVD）检测中的表现，结果表明Deep SVDD在检测与效率之间取得了最佳平衡，并在真实部署模拟中显著提高了分类器的准确性。

Conclusion: 优化的UAD滤波器可以保护自动化ECG分析，提高心血管监测的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

Result: 本论文研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器学习模型和超参数选择中的应用，探讨其作为元学习者的潜力。通过将每个数据集转换为可解释的元数据，论文展示了如何使用LLM推荐模型及其超参数。研究了两种提示策略，一种是零样本模式，依赖于预训练知识，另一种是元信息增强模式，结合了过往任务中模型及其表现的示例。实验结果表明，LLMs能够利用数据集的元数据在无需搜索的情况下推荐竞争力的模型和超参数，且元信息增强提示的改进证明其具备元学习能力。结果强调了LLM作为轻量级通用助手在模型选择与超参数优化中潜在的新角色。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型可以作为轻量级的通用助手，帮助进行模型选择和超参数优化，显著提高推荐效果。

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: ICPO提供了一种可扩展、有效的强化学习和可验证奖励方法，为大型推理模型的训练和推理能力提升带来了新思路。

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

Result: 这篇论文探讨了序列建模中，参量记忆如何以几何视角存储原子事实的方式表现出来。作者指出，传统的共现查找过程并不能完全解释模型对于实体之间关系的理解，模型可能已经综合了自身的几何信息，包括那些并未直接共现的关系。文章还讨论了神经嵌入几何学的若干基本特性，认为尽管优化的是局部关联，优雅的几何形状仍然能够学到，并展示了与Node2Vec的相关性，指出几何结构的产生并非简单的优化结果。这一观察为实践者提供了更多机会来增强Transformer的记忆特性，并希望该几何视角能够激励研究者重新思考知识获取、容量、发现以及遗忘等领域的直觉。

Conclusion: 这篇论文提供了对序列建模中记忆的新理解，它强调了几何结构在模型性能中的重要性，并建议研究者们在相关领域重新审视传统直觉。

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

Result: 本文提出了一种世界模型，即内部模型，能够模拟世界的演变，根据过去的观察和行动预测未来。尽管目前的世界模型取得了迅速进展，但在长时间预测时仍显得脆弱，主要原因在于表示质量不高。作者探讨了是否通过改善表示学习来显著提升世界模型的性能。为了构建一个准确的世界模型，提出了几何正则化世界模型（GRWM），该模型确保沿着自然感知轨迹的连续点在潜在表示空间中保持接近，从而显著提高潜在表示的质量。GRWM具有即插即用的特性，仅需最小的结构修改，且可扩展到长轨迹，兼容多种潜在生成框架。在多种确定性3D环境中，GRWM显著提高了预测的保真度和稳定性，分析表明其优势源于学习了具有优越几何结构的潜在流形。这表明改善表示学习是实现稳健世界模型的有效途径，可以在不扩展动态模块的情况下提供可靠的长期预测。

Conclusion: 改善表示学习能够有效提升世界模型的稳健性，从而实现可靠的长期预测，而无需扩大动态模块。

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Conclusion: HOHL展现了在主动学习和缺乏几何结构的数据集中的出色表现，证明了其在多种学习环境中的灵活性和稳健性。

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

Conclusion: 使用FP16可以有效消除大语言模型强化学习微调中的不稳定性，从而实现更稳定的优化、更快的收敛速度和更强的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的模型Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM)，用于模拟非梯度场动力学，特别是在单细胞RNA和流体动力学中的应用，克服了当前方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在处理非梯度、周期性行为的真实世界系统时存在瓶颈，因此需要一种新的方法来捕捉这种复杂的动态。

Method: 通过设计和解决具有非零漂移参考过程的Schr"odinger桥问题，结合推断的速度与群体快照数据来学习非梯度场动力学。

Result: Curly-FM在单细胞、计算流体动力学和洋流等多个领域展示了优于现有方法的轨迹推断性能。

Conclusion: Curly-FM通过解决具有非零漂移的Schr"odinger桥问题，能够更好地学习非梯度、周期性的轨迹，从而扩展了流动匹配模型的应用范围。

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了在差分隐私下计算矩阵前$r$个奇异向量的跨度的问题，提出了一种基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的高效算法，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Hardt和Roth提出的问题，改进现有差分隐私算法在计算奇异向量时的效果。

Method: 采用基于奇异值分解和标准扰动机制的算法来进行差分隐私下的秩-$r$近似计算。

Result: 提出的算法在多个设置中超越了当前最优解，并在低相干性假设下有效解决图问题。

Conclusion: 该算法在保持差分隐私的同时，实现了有效的秩-$r$近似，尤其在稠密设置中表现出色，并且在高斯扰动下保持输入的相干性。

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合精度后训练量化方法LoRAQuant，旨在优化低秩适应 (LoRA) 的多个适配器在大规模场景下的有效使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对大规模加载多个轻量级适配器时，聚集的成本显著增加，因此需要提升其参数效率。

Method: 通过奇异值分解（SVD）对每个适配器进行重新参数化，将最重要的信息集中在特定的行和列上，从而实现更高精度的量化和超低位宽的量化。

Result: 在对LLaMA 2-7B、LLaMA 2-13B和Mistral 7B模型的数学推理、编码和摘要任务进行全面实验后，LoRAQuant显示出显著的比特数节省与相似或更高的任务性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，LoRAQuant在比其他量化方法更低的比特数下，实现了可比或更高的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

Method: 提出预算性延迟框架

Result: 在预算性延迟框架下，提出了针对双阶段和单阶段多个专家延迟设置的新算法，能够选择性地只查询部分专家，从而减少训练成本并保持预测准确性

Conclusion: 预算性延迟算法在多个领域的实证结果表明其有效性，能够在控制成本的同时保留高水平的预测性能。

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

Motivation: 解决大规模分布式机器学习中的通信瓶颈，提升梯度稀疏化的方法的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的梯度草图，实现了跨节点稀疏模式的对齐，防止了信息丢失，采用了证明过的收缩性质，并结合了动量误差反馈。

Result: 提出了ARC-Top-K，一种兼容All-Reduce的Top-K压缩算法，使得跨节点进行稀疏模式对齐，提升了通信效率和收敛性。

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K在保证全局信息的同时，能显著加快训练速度，并在准确率上与Top-K持平，提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

Result: 发现相同架构和数据集下，不同MU方法对随机种子选择高度敏感，影响算法性能评估。

Conclusion: 对机器遗忘(MU)算法的比较应考虑不同模型训练随机种子之间的变异性，以提高结果的代表性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

Method: 提出了一种简单的扰动机制，用于在纯差分隐私下释放$d$维协方差矩阵$m{	ext{Σ}}$。

Result: 该机制在所有$p$-Schatten范数方面达到了最佳已知误差，并且在谱范数下首次实现了理想的协方差估计。

Conclusion: 总的来说，该机制在保证隐私的同时，显著提高了协方差矩阵估计的精度，尤其对小数据集进行了有效的优化。

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of

Motivation: 现有的OTA-FL设计在异构无线场景下存在限制，且大多关注凸目标，而现代AI模型通常是高度非凸的。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的OTA-FL SGD更新方法，允许结构化的时间不变模型偏差，并减少更新方差。并设计了一种有效的逐步凸近似（SCA）算法。

Result: SCA方法加速了收敛，并提升了相较于以往OTA-FL基线的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过实验证明新设计在非凸图像分类任务中加速收敛并改善泛化能力。

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

Method: 提出了一种新的序列变换与混合精度量化方法（STaMP），在序列维度上应用线性变换以增强量化效果。

Result: STaMP 量化显著改善了低比特宽度激活量化，并补充了现有的激活和权重量化方法，包括最近的特征变换。

Conclusion: STaMP 量化方法有效利用语言和视觉数据中的局部相关性，从而在降低激活比特宽度的同时保持模型准确性。

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

Conclusion: 我们的采样方法通过考虑特征或 logits 的随机分布，提升了影响函数估计的准确性，同时大幅减少了计算时间和内存占用。

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on

compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that

Conclusion: 模型在学习不同置换的伪随机数生成器时，能够识别出不同的结构，并展示了通过小模块数据提升学习更大模数的必要性，此外发现了输入的旋转不变性聚类现象。

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Result: 这项研究通过对三种不同的增强现实导航辅助工具（屏幕指南针、屏幕雷达和实世界垂直箭头）的比较，探索了它们在用户搜索隐藏虚拟目标中的效果。结果显示，所有导航工具相比于控制条件都提高了搜索性能，且用户对实世界箭头的偏好最强。同时，用户对物理对象的记忆较少，表明他们对物理环境的关注度降低。

Abstract: Head-worn augmented reality (AR) is a hotly pursued and increasingly feasible
contender paradigm for replacing or complementing smartphones and watches for
continual information consumption. Here, we compare three different AR
navigation aids (on-screen compass, on-screen radar and in-world vertical
arrows) in a wide-area outdoor user study (n=24) where participants search for
hidden virtual target items amongst physical and virtual objects. We analyzed
participants' search task performance, movements, eye-gaze, survey responses
and object recall. There were two key findings. First, all navigational aids
enhanced search performance relative to a control condition, with some benefit
and strongest user preference for in-world arrows. Second, users recalled fewer
physical objects than virtual objects in the environment, suggesting reduced
awareness of the physical environment. Together, these findings suggest that
while navigational aids presented in AR can enhance search task performance,
users may pay less attention to the physical environment, which could have
undesirable side-effects.

Abstract: Augmented reality is projected to be a primary mode of information

while navigating a physical environment could impact user efficacy and safety,
and the implications of these demands are not well understood. Here, we
investigate the impact of virtual path guidance and augmentation density
(visual clutter) on search performance and memory. Participants walked along a
predefined path, searching for physical or virtual items. They experienced two
levels of augmentation density, and either walked freely or with enforced speed
and path guidance. Augmentation density impacted behavior and reduced awareness
of uncommon objects in the environment. Analysis of search task performance and
post-experiment item recall revealed differing attention to physical and
virtual objects. On the basis of these findings we outline considerations for

*Zhengtao Ma,Rafael Gomez,Togtokhtur Batbold,Zishuo Zhu,Yueteng Yu,Ronald Schroeter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过对盲人和低视力参与者的实地调查，揭示了全自动车辆使用中信任的形成过程及交互设计的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨盲人和低视力（BLV）乘客在全自动车辆（FAVs）中的交互需求，以改善他们的出行体验。

Method: 定性研究和主题分析

Result: 参与者对FAVs最初表现出较高的信任，但在乘坐过程中需要多层次、以价值为导向的信息来增强信任感。参与者倾向于使用语音交互，提示对触觉的重新评估，以及对尊重互动设计的重视。

Conclusion: 本研究强调在FAVs的设计中，需结合尊严感与实证研究，来有效解决BLV用户的出行挑战并维护其尊严。

Abstract: Fully automated vehicles (FAVs) hold promise for enhancing the mobility of
blind and low-vision (BLV) individuals. To understand the situated interaction
needs of BLV passengers, we conducted six on-road, and in-lab focus groups with
16 participants, immersing them in real-world driving conditions. Our thematic
analysis reveals that BLV participants express a high initial 'faith' in FAVs,
but require layered, value-sensitive information during the ride to cultivate
trust. The participants' modality preference for voice suggests re-evaluating
the role of haptics for BLV users in FAVs. Our findings show the importance of
a respectful interaction design in FAVs that both address BLV users' mobility
challenges and uphold their dignity. While others have advocated for a dignity
lens, our contribution lies in grounding this framework in empirical findings
and unpacking what it means to design for dignity in the context of FAVs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究正念对心理健康的益处，尤其是对神经质和心理病理指标的降低，但初学者在实践中存在困难。

Method: 使用互动视听分形与脑电图界面，实时分析用户的脑电图流并映射到虚拟现实环境中。

Result: 初步反馈表明，FractalBrain能够促进正念并提高用户的注意力。

Conclusion: FractalBrain系统展现出促进正念和增强注意力的潜力，具有个性化体验的优势。

Abstract: Mindfulness has been studied and practiced in enhancing psychological
well-being while reducing neuroticism and psychopathological indicators.
However, practicing mindfulness with continuous attention is challenging,
especially for beginners. In the proposed system, FractalBrain, we utilize an
interactive audiovisual fractal with a geometric repetitive pattern that has
been demonstrated to induce meditative effects. FractalBrain presents an
experience combining a surreal virtual reality (VR) program with an
electroencephalogram (EEG) interface. While viewing an ever-changing
fractal-inspired artwork in an immersive environment, the user's EEG stream is
analyzed and mapped into VR. These EEG data adaptively manipulates the
audiovisual parameters in real-time, generating a distinct experience for each
user. The pilot feedback suggests the potential of the FractalBrain to
facilitate mindfulness and enhance attention.

Motivation: 解决文本提示与用户交互之间的协同设计缺乏正式模型的问题，以改善人类与生成式人工智能之间的沟通效果。

Method: 通过迭代和演绎过程，开发IAI模型，并从以往工具中提炼出交互范式，以验证该模型的有效性与实用性。

Result: 提出了互动增强指令（IAI）模型，并验证其在设计表征和比较中的应用能力，提炼出12种原子交互范式。

Conclusion: IAI模型在促进生成式人工智能系统的设计与创新方面具有描述性、区分性和生成力，能够形塑未来的发展方向。

Abstract: Text prompt is the most common way for human-generative AI (GenAI)
communication. Though convenient, it is challenging to convey fine-grained and
referential intent. One promising solution is to combine text prompts with
precise GUI interactions, like brushing and clicking. However, there lacks a
formal model to model synergistic designs between prompts and interactions,
hindering their comparison and innovation. To fill this gap, via an iterative
and deductive process, we develop the Interaction-Augmented Instruction (IAI)
model, a compact entity-relation graph formalizing how the combination of
interactions and text prompts enhances human-generative AI communication. With
the model, we distill twelve recurring and composable atomic interaction
paradigms from prior tools, verifying our model's capability to facilitate
systematic design characterization and comparison. Case studies further
demonstrate the model's utility in applying, refining, and extending these
paradigms. These results illustrate our IAI model's descriptive,
discriminative, and generative power for shaping future GenAI systems.

Motivation: 探讨虚拟头像在医疗应用中的外观如何影响其适宜性和用户体验。

Method: 分析了六个不同特征的虚拟头像，评估了参与者对头像的评级与个人偏好的相关性。

Result: 发现头像的能力感是选择头像的关键因素，而人类相似度对健康数据共享的影响较小。

Conclusion: 头像设计在医疗应用中至关重要，应考虑如何利用其外观特征来改善用户互动。

Abstract: The appearance of a virtual avatar significantly influences its perceived
appropriateness and the user's experience, particularly in healthcare
applications. This study analyzed interactions with six avatars of varying
characteristics in a patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) application to
investigate correlations between avatar ratings and user preferences.
Forty-seven participants completed a healthcare survey involving 30 PROMIS
items (Global Health and Physical Function) and then rated the avatars on
warmth, competence, attractiveness, and human-likeness, as well as their
willingness to share personal data. The results showed that competence was the
most critical factor in avatar selection, while human-likeness had minimal
impact on health data disclosure. Gender did not significantly affect the
ratings, but clothing style played a key role, with male avatars in
professional attire rated higher in competence due to gender-stereotypical
expectations. In contrast, professional female avatars were rated lower in
warmth and attractiveness. These findings underline the importance of
thoughtful avatar design in healthcare applications to enhance user experience
and engagement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在大型虚拟环境中利用视觉干扰物动态调整行走增益的效率与舒适度。

Method: 通过在用户视野中放置视觉干扰物，并根据用户对这些干扰物的关注程度动态调整行走增益。

Result: 引入视觉干扰物显著提高了用户的行走增益阈值，同时保持用户的舒适感和接受度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效支持了重定向行走系统的应用，提升了用户在虚拟环境中的导航体验。

Abstract: Redirected walking utilizes gain adjustments within perceptual thresholds to
allow natural navigation in large scale virtual environments within confined
physical environments. Previous research has found that when users are
distracted by some scene elements, they are less sensitive to gain values.
However, the effects on detection thresholds have not been quantitatively
measured. In this paper, we present a novel method that dynamically adjusts
translation gain by leveraging visual distractors. We place distractors within
the user's field of view and apply a larger translation gain when their
attention is drawn to them. Because the magnitude of gain adjustment depends on
the user's level of engagement with the distractors, the redirection process
remains smooth and unobtrusive. To evaluate our method, we developed a task
oriented virtual environment for a user study. Results show that introducing
distractors in the virtual environment significantly raises users' translation
gain thresholds. Furthermore, assessments using the Simulator Sickness
Questionnaire and Igroup Presence Questionnaire indicate that the method
maintains user comfort and acceptance, supporting its effectiveness for RDW
systems.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了通过教练式LLM支持创造性工作的有效性，强调个体差异及角色导向对创造力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在大型语言模型的使用中，平衡提供指导与支持个体创造力之间的张力。

Method: 通过开发教练式大型语言模型（LLM）环境来支持创造性工作和问题解决，采用发散和聚合思维角色两种互补过程，同时通过控制实验评估其有效性和用户行为。

Result: 研究发现，用户对不同角色在支持创造力上的感知与客观表现可能存在差异，个体差异影响人们对发散与聚合角色的利用，反映出设计思维模型的互动模式。

Conclusion: 本研究为创造力支持系统提供了设计原则，推动人机合作工具的发展，以支持而非取代人类创造力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping creative work and
problem-solving; however, prior research suggests that they may diminish
unassisted creativity. To address this tension, a coach-like LLM environment
was developed that embodies divergent and convergent thinking personas as two
complementary processes. Effectiveness and user behavior were assessed through
a controlled experiment in which participants interacted with either persona,
while a control group engaged with a standard LLM providing direct answers.
  Notably, users' perceptions of which persona best supported their creativity
often diverged from objective performance measures. Trait-based analyses
revealed that individual differences predict when people utilize divergent
versus convergent personas, suggesting opportunities for adaptive sequencing.
Furthermore, interaction patterns reflected the design thinking model,
demonstrating how persona-guided support shapes creative problem-solving.
  Our findings provide design principles for creativity support systems that
strike a balance between exploration and convergence through persona-based
guidance and personalization. These insights advance human-AI collaboration
tools that scaffold rather than overshadow human creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在理解自信心如何影响个体选择依赖生成性人工智能给出的建议，并探讨这一过程的双向性。

Method: 通过两个研究（共500名参与者），探讨了自信心对向生成性人工智能寻求建议的影响及其后续对自信心的塑造。

Result: 结果显示，寻求建议的人在与AI互动后的自信心有所提升，而拒绝建议的人则增强了自我信心，且建议的接触增强了对AI及自我的信心。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了人类在与生成性人工智能互动时自信心的双向影响，反映了自我信心与AI建议的可靠性之间的动态关系。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can aid humans in a wide range of
tasks, but its effectiveness critically depends on users being able to evaluate
the accuracy of GenAI outputs and their own expertise. Here we asked how
confidence in self and GenAI contributes to decisions to seek and rely on
advice from GenAI ('prospective confidence'), and how advice-taking in turn
shapes this confidence ('retrospective confidence'). In a novel paradigm
involving text generation, participants formulated plans for events, and could
request advice from a GenAI (Study 1; N=200) or were randomly assigned to
receive advice (Study 2; N=300), which they could rely on or ignore. Advice
requests in Study 1 were related to higher prospective confidence in GenAI and
lower confidence in self. Advice-seekers showed increased retrospective
confidence in GenAI, while those who declined advice showed increased
confidence in self. Random assignment in Study 2 revealed that advice exposure
increases confidence in GenAI and in self, suggesting that GenAI advice-taking
causally boosts retrospective confidence. These results were mirrored in advice
reliance, operationalised as the textual similarity between GenAI advice and
participants' responses, with reliance associated with increased retrospective
confidence in both GenAI and self. Critically, participants who chose to
obtain/rely on advice provided more detailed responses (likely due to the
output's verbosity), but failed to check the output thoroughly, missing key
information. These findings underscore a key role for confidence in
interactions with GenAI, shaped by both prior beliefs about oneself and the
reliability of AI, and context-dependent exposure to advice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前国际象棋引擎提供精确但不透明的评估，典型用centipawn分数表示，难以理解单个棋子的贡献。

Method: 通过将棋子视为特征并系统性地去除它们来计算每个棋子的贡献。

Result: 提出了一种将SHAP应用于国际象棋分析的方法，能将引擎的评估归因于棋盘上的特定棋子。

Conclusion: 该方法为解释国际象棋引擎的评估提供了新的视角，并促进了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

TL;DR: 多模态大型语言模型对文本的偏好源于内部结构，而非仅由外部数据因素导致，视觉和文本键在注意力空间表现出显著的分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多模态大型语言模型在处理视觉-语言数据时对文本输入的偏好，以及这种偏好对模型推理能力的影响。

Method: 使用t-SNE和Jensen-Shannon散度等方法提取和分析LLaVA与Qwen2.5-VL的关键向量分布结构。

Result: 通过分析LLaVA和Qwen2.5-VL的关键向量，发现视觉和文本键在注意力空间中占据了明显不同的子空间，验证了内在的偏差假设。

Conclusion: 研究表明，文本偏差来源于注意力关键空间的内在不匹配，而不仅仅是数据不平衡等外部因素。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在主观任务评估中的可靠性问题，尤其是人类判断中复杂推理的隐含性。

Method: 提出一种人类与大型语言模型协作的框架，通过仅基于标签的注释推断思维痕迹，并使用重采样方法进行重建。

Result: 提出的框架在多个数据集上显著提高了大型语言模型与人类之间的一致性，同时改善了不同大型语言模型之间的协议。

Conclusion: 推断出的思维痕迹能够增强大型语言模型的可靠性，使得标签数据集可以扩展为包含思维痕迹的增强资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个两层框架，解释压缩过程如何通过因果模型选择影响智能的形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架未能明确解释压缩如何促使因果结构的发现，而不是肤浅的统计模式。

Method: 提出一个两层框架，使用信息理论和压缩原理解释智能与因果结构发现的关系。

Result: 建立了信息理论必然性（ITI）和压缩效率原则（CEP），定义了从生存压力到现实对齐的因果链。

Conclusion: 智能是在结构化环境中持久存在的机械必要结果，提供了生物、人工和多尺度系统之间收敛的统一解释。

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

Conclusion: 主要贡献包括一种大规模合成偏好标签的方法和两种聚合器的实现：广义加法模型(GAM)和多层感知器(MLP)。

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提供高效且经济实惠的语言模型，同时保持与现有模型（如GPT-4o）相当的准确性。

Method: 结合了最小化的“外骨骼推理”支架和行为微调，以教授协议合规性而非领域答案。

Result: Humans-Junior在Q1-Q500中以72.7%的评分，与GPT-4o的73.5%相当，且降价近19倍。

Conclusion: Humans-Junior是一种3.8B模型，能在FACTS Grounding公共子集上与GPT-4o相匹敌，且在成本上显著低于GPT-4o。

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

Method: 通过探讨有关问责制的一般定义与人工智能的关系，分析AI的问责与不问责实例，并探索改善AI问责的方法。

Result: 虽然现有许多人工智能系统缺乏问责机制，但通过适当的方法可以改善这一现状。

Conclusion: 人工智能的问责制是确保其服务于消费者和决策者需求的关键。

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research literature, particularly in large language
models (LLMs), has made producing comprehensive and current survey papers
increasingly difficult. This paper introduces autosurvey2, a multi-stage
pipeline that automates survey generation through retrieval-augmented synthesis
and structured evaluation. The system integrates parallel section generation,
iterative refinement, and real-time retrieval of recent publications to ensure
both topical completeness and factual accuracy. Quality is assessed using a
multi-LLM evaluation framework that measures coverage, structure, and relevance
in alignment with expert review standards. Experimental results demonstrate
that autosurvey2 consistently outperforms existing retrieval-based and
automated baselines, achieving higher scores in structural coherence and
topical relevance while maintaining strong citation fidelity. By combining
retrieval, reasoning, and automated evaluation into a unified framework,
autosurvey2 provides a scalable and reproducible solution for generating
long-form academic surveys and contributes a solid foundation for future
research on automated scholarly writing. All code and resources are available

*Rishub Jain,Sophie Bridgers,Lili Janzer,Rory Greig,Tian Huey Teh,Vladimir Mikulik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨利用AI提高事实验证的质量，发现结合AI与人类评分效果最佳，且提供合适的辅助方式能有效提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI能力的提升，如何确保证明AI系统的质量和安全变得越来越重要，因此需要有效的人类反馈机制。

Method: 结合人工反馈和AI评级，探讨AI在提升人类监督质量中的作用，特别是在AI输出的事实验证方面。

Result: 将AI评级与基于AI评分者自信度的人类评级结合使用，效果优于单独依赖任何一方；使用AI验证助手可提高人类的准确性，但援助类型的不同会影响结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果对Amplified Oversight具有启示，强调了人类与AI的有效结合以监督更高性能的AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文提出了一种名为StuckSolver的框架，提升了自主车辆在不可动情况下的自我恢复能力，兼容现有系统并显示出优越的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自主车辆技术已取得重大进展，但在某些交通场景下仍然无法达到人类驾驶者的灵活性，导致交通流动中断，因此需要有效的恢复解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的恢复框架StuckSolver，作为自主车辆现有感知-规划-控制系统的插件，利用标准传感器数据流来检测堵塞状态并生成恢复指令。

Result: StuckSolver在Bench2Drive基准测试和定制的不确定性场景上进行了评估，显示通过自主自我推理获得近乎最先进的性能，且在引入乘客引导时表现更佳。

Conclusion: StuckSolver通过自我推理和乘客引导决策，提高了自主车辆在遇到堵塞情况下的恢复能力，展现出接近最先进的性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

Motivation: 为了建立物理形式推理的基础，提供一个针对大学物理的正式推理框架。

Method: 通过建立**LeanPhysBench**和**PhysLib**，并使用主要的Math Lean4证明者及最新模型进行基准测试，评估性能。

Result: 测试结果显示，最好的模型性能分别为16%和35%，**PhysLib**平均提升模型性能11.75%。

Conclusion: **Lean4PHYS**是首个针对Lean4的物理基准，展示了其挑战性和**PhysLib**的有效性。

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

TL;DR: 本研究通过识别GUI知识的缺失，提出了一个新的评估基准，并验证其与任务成功的相关性，旨在提升视觉语言模型在图形用户界面任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在填补大规模视觉语言模型在图形用户界面任务执行中的性能差距，特别是缺乏核心的GUI知识。

Method: 通过分析图形用户界面任务执行中的常见失败模式，提炼出三维GUI知识并引入GUI Knowledge Bench进行评估。

Result: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然能够识别小部件功能，但在感知系统状态、预测交互行为以及验证任务完成方面仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了GUI知识基准，为评估和提升大规模视觉语言模型在图形用户界面任务自动化中的性能提供了结构化框架。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

Result: 构建了首个"LLM推断生产边界"，揭示边际成本递减、规模收益递减及最佳性价比区域。

Conclusion: 该研究为大规模语言模型的部署和未来AI推断资源的市场定价提供了经济基础。

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 推理课程通过两个阶段来提升语言模型的推理能力，获得了跨领域的良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过强化学习 (RL) 在大语言模型 (LLM) 中引发强推理能力，但现有的努力多集中于数学和代码领域，因此需探索更广泛的推理能力。

Method: 推理课程分为两个阶段：第一阶段专注于数学领域的冷启动和强化学习；第二阶段在混合领域数据上进行联合强化学习，以转移和巩固推理技能。

Result: 提出的推理课程在多领域测试中对于 Qwen3-4B 和 Llama-3.1-8B 模型均取得了一致的提高。

Conclusion: 推理课程是一种紧凑且易于采用的方案，能有效促进一般推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大语言模型在处理问卷数据时的能力未被充分探索，缺乏有效的指导和工具来优化数据表现，因此需要研究更好的问卷结构表示法。

Method: 通过六种结构技能的基准测试，实验评估不同序列化格式与提示策略对大语言模型的影响。

Result: 本研究提出了QASU（问卷分析与结构理解），这是一个考察大语言模型在处理问卷数据时的结构技能的基准测试。针对六种结构技能进行评估，并且通过不同的序列化格式和提示策略进行实验。研究表明，合理的格式和提示组合可以提高准确性，进而为科学家、调查者和普通用户提供证据支持的问卷表示方法。

Conclusion: QASU基准为提升基于LLM的问卷分析提供了有效工具，通过优化格式和提示策略可显著提高分析效果。

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种改进的状态抽象技术IPA-UCT，旨在提升蒙特卡洛树搜索的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高MCTS的样本效率，解决现有算法在大动作空间中难以找到状态抽象的问题。

Method: 本研究通过提出一种较弱的状态抽象条件，进行理论和实证分析，验证其有效性。

Result: 通过IPA-UCT技术，能够找到更多的状态抽象，同时保持适度的准确性提升搜索效率。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，IPA-UCT在多个测试领域和迭代预算下均优于OGA-UCT及其衍生版本。

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为BOTS的贝叶斯在线任务选择框架，以改善大型语言模型的强化微调效果，解决了任务选择的效率和适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化微调(REINFORCEMENT FINETUNING)是对大型语言模型进行对齐和推理增强的关键技术，但现有的任务选择方法存在效率低下和适应性差的问题。

Method: BOTS通过贝叶斯推断，适应性地维护任务难度的后验估计，结合了已评估任务的显性证据和未评估任务的隐性证据，并采用汤普森采样实现探索与利用的平衡。

Result: BOTS通过引入超轻插值插件，实现在没有额外推理的情况下估计未评估任务的难度，从而提升了任务选择的效率。

Conclusion: BOTS在多种领域和不同规模的LLM中，数据效率和性能均优于现有基线，提供了一种动态任务选择的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了人类与AI合作推理如何推动数学发现的前沿，并成功提供了完整且可验证的证明。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在评估大型语言模型时，当前方法的局限性在于高昂的评估成本及不能处理新基准的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于任务项固有属性的项中心方法，命名为Scales++，用于基准子集选择。

Result: Scales++方法在保持竞争性预测精度的同时，将选择成本降低了18倍，并在Open LLM Leaderboard上使用仅0.5%的数据子集实现了2.9%的平均绝对误差。

Conclusion: 项中心的方法提供了更高效的模型评估方式，具备更好的冷启动性能和可解释性，而不会显著降低精度。

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

TL;DR: Autograder+通过使用大型语言模型生成反馈和可视化代码提交，提升了编程教育中的反馈质量，减轻教师负担，促进学生学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编程教育的迅速增长超越了传统评估工具，教师在提供有意义和可扩展反馈方面面临限制。传统自动评分系统仅提供简单的通过/不通过结果，无法深入了解学生思维或学习需求。

Method: 开发了Autograder+系统，采用精细调优的大型语言模型生成自动反馈，并对学生代码提交进行可视化，以揭示学习模式。

Result: 系统在对600个学生提交进行评估时，生成的反馈与教师评论具有强语义对齐。使用基于1000个注释提交训练的对比学习代码嵌入，可以根据功能和方法将解决方案分组。

Conclusion: Autograder+通过集成AI驱动的反馈、语义聚类和互动可视化，减轻了教师的工作负担，支持有针对性的教学，并促进了更强的学习成果。

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a

Conclusion: 最具可解释性的推理形式——显式的链式思维，当与最终答案提示结合时，可能会成为新的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

Result: 尽管大语言模型普遍遵循有效的推理模式，但在某些规范性推理类型中表现出显著的不一致性，并展示了类似于人类推理心理学研究的认知偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs在规范推理中面临逻辑一致性的挑战，这为提高其可靠性提供了洞见。

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为评估当代基础模型的推理能力提供全面的基准，覆盖多个学术领域，从而推动模型选择和研究进展。

Method: 通过在HPC超级计算机、云平台和大学集群上的基础模型进行综合跨平台评估，建立了独立于基础设施的基准。在三个实验阶段中进行评估。

Result: 评估了15个基础模型在79个问题上的表现，揭示了模型选择的指导原则并增强了推理能力的可追踪性。

Conclusion: 本研究的发现挑战了传统的扩展假设，确立了训练数据质量在模型大小之上更为关键，并提供了在教育、生产和研究背景下选择模型的可行指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

TL;DR: 本研究揭示了变压器语言模型如何通过注意力头编码过滤操作的因果表示，并能在多样的任务中实现相似的过滤策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型在列表处理任务中所采用的机制，特别是它们如何实现和表达抽象计算操作。

Method: 通过因果中介分析，研究了在不同的列表处理任务中，注意力头如何编码过滤谓词的紧凑表示。

Result: 识别出少数几个被称为过滤头的注意力头，它们在特定的token查询状态中编码过滤谓词的表示，并发现这些表示可以在不同的集合和任务中重用。

Conclusion: 变压器语言模型（LLMs）能够编码紧凑的因果表示，这种表示与传统函数式编程中的“过滤”函数相似，并能在多种任务中广泛应用。

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

TL;DR: 本研究通过分层多智能体强化学习框架分析市场中的算法串通，探讨不同智能体之间的互动及其对市场的影响，发现自适应激励控制有助于实现更可持续的智能体共存。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同AI智能体在市场中的互动是否会导致串通，并理解这种新兴行为如何影响市场。

Method: 提出了一个分层的多智能体强化学习框架，研究市场交易中的算法串通。

Result: Agent~B2在零和环境中表现出色，Agent~B$^ullet$在与其他寻求利润的智能体共存时表现出自利倾向，提供了不同的市场影响。

Conclusion: 自适应激励控制支持在异构智能体环境中的可持续战略共存，并为评估算法交易系统中的行为设计提供了结构化的视角。

Abstract: Algorithmic collusion has emerged as a central question in AI: Will the
interaction between different AI agents deployed in markets lead to collusion?
More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market
dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important
research question.
  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to
study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a
self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain
environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the
self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the
competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent),
and the hybrid Agent~B$^\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the
other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and
affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify
behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals
potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.
  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a
zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening
average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast,
Agent~B$^\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with
other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive
quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1
compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports
more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and
offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic
trading systems.

TL;DR: SupervisorAgent是一个轻量级的模块化框架，通过实时适应性监督，主动纠正多智能体系统的错误行为，显著减少令牌消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统（MAS）在复杂任务中表现出色，其自主性和操作复杂性的提高往往导致关键低效问题，例如过度的令牌消耗和因错误信息导致的失败。因此，有必要开发主动的实时干预方法，以增强其鲁棒性和效率。

Method: 采用LLM-free自适应过滤器触发SupervisorAgent，在关键时刻进行干预，纠正错误、指导低效行为并净化观察。

Result: SupervisorAgent框架在GAIA基准测试中将Smolagent框架的令牌消耗平均减少了29.45%，而成功率未受到影响。

Conclusion: SupervisorAgent展示了在多个基准测试中的广泛适用性和鲁棒性，证明了其能够有效提高多智能体系统的效率。

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at complex tasks, their growing
autonomy with operational complexity often leads to critical inefficiencies,
such as excessive token consumption and failures arising from misinformation.
Existing methods primarily focus on post-hoc failure attribution, lacking
proactive, real-time interventions to enhance robustness and efficiency. To
this end, we introduce SupervisorAgent, a lightweight and modular framework for
runtime, adaptive supervision that operates without altering the base agent's
architecture. Triggered by an LLM-free adaptive filter, SupervisorAgent
intervenes at critical junctures to proactively correct errors, guide
inefficient behaviors, and purify observations. On the challenging GAIA
benchmark, SupervisorAgent reduces the token consumption of the Smolagent
framework by an average of 29.45% without compromising its success rate.
Extensive experiments across five additional benchmarks (math reasoning, code
generation, and question answering) and various SoTA foundation models validate
the broad applicability and robustness of our approach. The code is available
at https://github.com/LINs-lab/SupervisorAgent.

TL;DR: GIFF框架通过优化公平性与效率，在多智能体资源分配中表现出色，具备理论支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限的环境中，智能体优化效率往往会导致不平等的结果，因此有必要引入公平性概念。

Method: 本研究提出GIFF框架，通过使用GIFF改进的Q值，在集中控制环境中解决资源分配问题。

Result: 实证评估表明，GIFF框架在多个领域表现优于强基线，并能够发现远见且公平的政策。

Conclusion: GIFF是一种有效且原则性的框架，通过标准的强化学习组件实现多智能体系统中的公平资源分配。

Abstract: We introduce the General Incentives-based Framework for Fairness (GIFF), a
novel approach for fair multi-agent resource allocation that infers fair
decision-making from standard value functions. In resource-constrained
settings, agents optimizing for efficiency often create inequitable outcomes.
Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and
fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method
computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual
advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off
agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where
an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.
  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing,
homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our
framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover
far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by
a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower
bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers
monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled
framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve
more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.
