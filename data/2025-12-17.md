Abstract: Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) has made significant progress in recognizing simple expressions, but the robust recognition of complex mathematical expressions with many tokens and multiple lines remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M. Experimental results show that CMERNet, with only 125 million parameters, significantly outperforms existing MER models and MLLMs on CMER-Bench.

TL;DR: 论文探索了AIGC在新闻特殊报道中可控图像生成的路径，通过两个实验提出人机协作机制和评估指标，解决透明度、准确性和语义对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC辅助图像生产在新闻领域引发争议，主要问题包括虚假信息、真实性、语义保真度和可解释性。现有AIGC工具大多是不透明的'黑箱'，难以满足内容准确性和语义对齐的双重要求，造成伦理、社会技术和信任困境。

Method: 1) 实验1：通过标准化提示在三个场景中测试跨平台适应性，揭示训练语料偏差和平台级过滤导致的语义对齐、文化特异性和视觉真实性差异；2) 实验2：构建人机循环模块化流水线，结合高精度分割（SAM、GroundingDINO）、语义对齐（BrushNet）和风格调控（Style-LoRA、Prompt-to-Prompt），通过CLIP语义评分、NSFW/OCR/YOLO过滤和可验证内容凭证确保编辑保真度。

Result: 基于实验提出了新闻特殊报道中AIGC辅助图像生产的人机协作机制，并建议评估角色身份稳定性（CIS）、文化表达准确性（CEA）和用户-公众适当性（U-PA）。

Conclusion: 通过可追溯部署保持语义表示，为AIGC在新闻特殊报道中的应用提供了可控的图像生成路径和人机协作框架。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) assisting image production triggers controversy in journalism while attracting attention from media agencies. Key issues involve misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability. Most AIGC tools are opaque "black boxes," hindering the dual demands of content accuracy and semantic alignment and creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas. This paper explores pathways for controllable image production in journalism's special coverage and conducts two experiments with projects from China's media agency: (1) Experiment 1 tests cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes, revealing disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. (2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials. Traceable deployment preserves semantic representation. Consequently, we propose a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC assisted image production in special coverage and recommend evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).

Abstract: Medical image classifiers detect gastrointestinal diseases well, but they do not explain their decisions. Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems. The complete source code and datasets used in this study are available at https://github.com/souravbasakshuvo/DL3M.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前多模态大语言模型在医学决策任务上表现不佳，单文本推理优于视觉或视觉文本组合，需通过上下文学习、视觉描述和视觉塔微调等策略提升医疗多模态决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在一般视觉语言任务上表现优异，但在医学领域，即使是先进模型也难以处理基本医学决策任务，需要通过实证研究探索其局限性及改进方向。

Method: 使用阿尔茨海默病三阶段分类和MIMIC-CXR胸片分类数据集，对比文本、视觉及多模态输入表现，并探索三种改进策略：带推理注释的上下文学习、视觉描述后文本推理、视觉塔的少样本有监督微调。

Result: 仅文本推理在医学分类任务中持续优于仅视觉或视觉文本组合，多模态输入常比纯文本更差，表明当前MLLMs缺乏扎实的视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在医学决策中视觉理解基础薄弱，但通过针对性策略如上下文学习和视觉塔微调可显著提升医疗多模态决策能力，为未来改进指明方向。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities on vision-language tasks. In the biomedical domain, however, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with basic Medical Decision Making (MDM) tasks. We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision. These findings reveal that current MLLMs lack grounded visual understanding and point to promising directions for improving multimodal decision making in healthcare.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) play a pivotal role in advancing the quest for general artificial intelligence. However, achieving unified target for multimodal understanding and generation remains challenging due to optimization conflicts and performance trade-offs. To effectively enhance generative performance while preserving existing comprehension capabilities, we introduce STAR: a STacked AutoRegressive scheme for task-progressive unified multimodal learning. This approach decomposes multimodal learning into multiple stages: understanding, generation, and editing. By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.

TL;DR: 提出一种将几何与外观解耦的紧凑表示方法，用面元表示几何，用全局神经场和每个图元的颜色表示外观，显著减少了所需图元数量和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高斯泼溅法虽然在新颖视图合成中取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但需要数百万个图元来建模高度纹理化的场景，即使场景几何结构很简单。这导致了高内存消耗和计算成本。

Method: 1. 使用面元表示几何；2. 结合全局神经场和每个图元的颜色来表示外观；3. 神经场为每个像素固定数量的图元进行纹理处理，确保计算成本低。

Result: 1. 室外场景：使用9.7倍更少的图元和5.5倍更少的内存；2. 室内场景：使用31倍更少的图元和3.7倍更少的内存；3. 渲染速度比现有纹理图元快两倍，同时视觉质量有所提升。

Conclusion: 该表示方法在保持高斯泼溅法感知质量的同时，大幅减少了图元数量和内存消耗，提高了渲染效率，为实现紧凑的场景表示提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Though Gaussian splatting has achieved impressive results in novel view synthesis, it requires millions of primitives to model highly textured scenes, even when the geometry of the scene is simple. We propose a representation that goes beyond point-based rendering and decouples geometry and appearance in order to achieve a compact representation. We use surfels for geometry and a combination of a global neural field and per-primitive colours for appearance. The neural field textures a fixed number of primitives for each pixel, ensuring that the added compute is low. Our representation matches the perceptual quality of 3D Gaussian splatting while using $9.7\times$ fewer primitives and $5.5\times$ less memory on outdoor scenes and using $31\times$ fewer primitives and $3.7\times$ less memory on indoor scenes. Our representation also renders twice as fast as existing textured primitives while improving upon their visual quality.

Abstract: We introduce MoLingo, a text-to-motion (T2M) model that generates realistic, lifelike human motion by denoising in a continuous latent space. Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study. We will release our code and models for further research and downstream usage.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training object detectors demands extensive, task-specific annotations, yet this requirement becomes impractical in UAV-based human detection due to constantly shifting target distributions and the scarcity of labeled images. As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the global and local stages and highlight the importance of hierarchical alignment. The code is released at \href{https://github.com/liwd190019/CFHA}{this url}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Detection Transformer (DETR) offers an end-to-end solution for object detection by eliminating hand-crafted components like non-maximum suppression. However, DETR suffers from inefficient query competition where multiple queries converge to similar positions, leading to redundant computations. We present Route-DETR, which addresses these issues through adaptive pairwise routing in decoder self-attention layers. Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.

Method: 提出KLO-Net，结合动态K-NN注意机制和交叉阶段部分（CSP）编码器。动态K-NN注意使模型能自适应确定切片内每个空间位置的注意连接数；CSP块减少计算负载和内存消耗。在两个公开数据集（PROMISE12和PROSTATEx）进行实验与消融研究

Result: 详细比较分析表明该模型在计算效率和分割质量方面具有优势

Conclusion: KLO-Net能够弥合效率差距，同时保持可靠的分割准确性，适合临床工作站实时部署

Abstract: Real-time deployment of prostate MRI segmentation on clinical workstations is often bottlenecked by computational load and memory footprint. Deep learning-based prostate gland segmentation approaches remain challenging due to anatomical variability. To bridge this efficiency gap while still maintaining reliable segmentation accuracy, we propose KLO-Net, a dynamic K-Nearest Neighbor attention U-Net with Cross Stage Partial, i.e., CSP, encoder for efficient prostate gland segmentation from MRI scan. Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice. In addition, CSP blocks address the computational load to reduce memory consumption. To evaluate the model's performance, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx, to validate the proposed architecture. The detailed comparative analysis demonstrates the model's advantage in computational efficiency and segmentation quality.

TL;DR: 提出‘去品牌化’新任务，旨在精细移除图像中的商标和结构性品牌特征，同时保持语义连贯性，并构建了基准数据集和VLM评估指标来量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前文本生成图像模型快速发展，容易未经授权复制商标内容。现有方法仅针对通用概念（如风格、名人），未能处理具体品牌标识。品牌识别是多维度的，不仅包括显式商标，还包含微妙的结构特征（如汽车前格栅）。需要解决这些具体品牌特征的移除问题。

Method: 引入‘去品牌化’任务，专注于精细移除商标和结构性品牌特征。构建了全面的基准数据集。提出基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的新评估指标，使用问答框架来探测图像中的显式商标和隐含的品牌特征。该指标弥补了现有品牌检测器仅关注商标、无法捕捉抽象商业外观（如可口可乐瓶形状）的不足。

Result: 随着模型保真度提高（SDXL、FLUX比比Stable Diffusion等旧模型更容易合成品牌标识），去品牌化问题的紧迫性凸显。通过VLM指标验证的结果确认，去品牌化是一个独特且具有实际意义的问题，需要专门技术来解决。

Conclusion: 去品牌化是文本生成图像模型中一个需要专门方法解决的重要问题。提出的VLM评估指标能有效评估品牌特征的移除效果，为未来研究提供了基准和支持。研究展示了该任务的实用性和紧迫性，特别是随着图像生成模型质量的不断提升。

Abstract: The rapid progress of text-to-image diffusion models raises significant concerns regarding the unauthorized reproduction of trademarked content. While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques. Project Page: https://gmum.github.io/UNBRANDING/.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) is a promising paradigm for improving autonomous driving safety, particularly for vulnerable road users like pedestrians, via robust 3D perception. However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups. FocalComm also shows a strong performance gain in pedestrian detection in V2X-Real.

Abstract: We present a framework that adapts 2D diffusion models for 3D shape completion from incomplete point clouds. While text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success with abundant 2D data, 3D diffusion models lag due to the scarcity of high-quality 3D datasets and a persistent modality gap between 3D inputs and 2D latent spaces. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Shape Atlas, a compact 2D representation of 3D geometry that (1) enables full utilization of the generative power of pretrained 2D diffusion models, and (2) aligns the modalities between the conditional input and output spaces, allowing more effective conditioning. This unified 2D formulation facilitates learning from limited 3D data and produces high-quality, detail-preserving shape completions. We validate the effectiveness of our results on the PCN and ShapeNet-55 datasets. Additionally, we show the downstream application of creating artist-created meshes from our completed point clouds, further demonstrating the practicality of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然掩码离散扩散模型在多模态任务上表现优异，但其推理速度不理想，因为每个采样步骤都需要重复处理冗余的掩码标记

Method: 提出Sparse-LaViDa框架，通过在推理步骤动态截断不必要的掩码标记，并引入专门的寄存器标记作为截断标记的紧凑表示，同时设计专门的注意力掩码来确保训练和推理的一致性

Result: 基于最新的统一MDM模型LaViDa-O构建的Sparse-LaViDa在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和数学推理等任务上实现了最高2倍的加速，同时保持生成质量

Conclusion: Sparse-LaViDa是一种高效加速掩码离散扩散模型的方法，通过动态截断冗余标记显著提升推理速度而不影响生成质量

Abstract: Masked Discrete Diffusion Models (MDMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks, including image understanding, generation, and editing. However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling. To preserve generation quality, we introduce specialized register tokens that serve as compact representations for the truncated tokens. Furthermore, to ensure consistency between training and inference, we design a specialized attention mask that faithfully matches the truncated sampling procedure during training. Built upon the state-of-the-art unified MDM LaViDa-O, Sparse-LaViDa achieves up to a 2x speedup across diverse tasks including text-to-image generation, image editing, and mathematical reasoning, while maintaining generation quality.

Motivation: 现有长视频问答研究中缺乏直接评估关键帧采样质量的基准，通常只能通过问答准确性间接评估。关键帧采样对提升多模态大语言模型在长视频理解中的准确性和效率至关重要，但没有专门的工具来分析和比较不同采样方法。

Method: 提出KFS-Bench基准，包含多场景标注，允许直接分析不同采样方法在整个长视频中捕捉关键内容的能力。研究发现采样精度、场景覆盖和采样平衡是影响问答性能的关键因素，设计了新的采样质量度量标准。此外，开发了新的关键帧采样方法，利用问题-视频相关性来平衡采样多样性与问题帧相似性。

Result: KFS-Bench基准首次实现直接评估关键帧采样策略。研究表明采样精度、场景覆盖和采样平衡共同影响问答性能。提出的自适应平衡采样方法在关键帧采样和问答性能方面均表现出色。

Conclusion: KFS-Bench填补了长视频问答中关键帧采样评估的空白，识别了影响性能的关键因素，并提出了有效的度量标准和方法。自适应平衡采样方法通过平衡采样多样性与问题相关性，提高了相关场景的覆盖率，在问答任务中取得了优越表现。基准已公开可用。

Abstract: We propose KFS-Bench, the first benchmark for key frame sampling in long video question answering (QA), featuring multi-scene annotations to enable direct and robust evaluation of sampling strategies. Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding. In long video QA, selecting informative frames enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve both accuracy and efficiency. KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes. Our adaptively balanced sampling approach achieves superior performance in both key frame sampling and QA performance. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/NEC-VID/KFS-Bench.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning integrating medical images and tabular data has significantly advanced clinical decision-making in recent years. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that CITab outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for effective and scalable cross-tabular multi-modal learning.

Abstract: We consider the problem of active 3D imaging using single-shot structured light systems, which are widely employed in commercial 3D sensing devices such as Apple Face ID and Intel RealSense. Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

Abstract: We present a novel neural RGB-D Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) system that learns an implicit map of the scene in real time. For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.
  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation. We evaluate our approach on established synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating competitive performance against the state of the art. Project Page: https://github.com/ialzugaray/ace-slam

Abstract: Recent advances have equipped 3D Gaussian Splatting with texture parameterizations to capture spatially varying attributes, improving the performance of both appearance modeling and downstream tasks. However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.

Abstract: With their high information density and intuitive readability, charts have become the de facto medium for data analysis and communication across disciplines. Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.

Abstract: The deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving (AD) is critically hindered by reliability failures, most notably object hallucination. This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and "zoom in" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward. This reward not only eliminates the need for dense labels but also circumvents the instability of external tool calls by enforcing real-time cross-modal consistency between the visual focus and the textual reasoning. Extensive experiments on DriveLMM-o1 demonstrate our model's significant improvements. Compared to the baseline Qwen2.5VL-7B, OmniDrive-R1 improves the overall reasoning score from 51.77% to 80.35%, and the final answer accuracy from 37.81% to 73.62%.

Conclusion: SELECT通过创新的多模态训练和SSLC机制，有效解决了真实场景文本数据集中的标签错误检测问题，为实际应用提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We introduce SELECT (Scene tExt Label Errors deteCTion), a novel approach that leverages multi-modal training to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets. Utilizing an image-text encoder and a character-level tokenizer, SELECT addresses the issues of variable-length sequence labels, label sequence misalignment, and character-level errors, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and practical utility. In addition, we introduce Similarity-based Sequence Label Corruption (SSLC), a process that intentionally introduces errors into the training labels to mimic real-world error scenarios during training. SSLC not only can cause a change in the sequence length but also takes into account the visual similarity between characters during corruption. Our method is the first to detect label errors in real-world scene text datasets successfully accounting for variable-length labels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SELECT in detecting label errors and improving STR accuracy on real-world text datasets, showcasing its practical utility.

Abstract: Current multimodal large lanauge models possess strong perceptual and reasoning capabilities, however high computational and memory requirements make them difficult to deploy directly on on-device environments. While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.

Abstract: Talking face editing and face generation have often been studied as distinct problems. In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.

Abstract: Daylight-linked controls (DLCs) have significant potential for energy savings in buildings, especially when abundant daylight is available and indoor workplane illuminance can be accurately predicted in real time. Most existing studies on indoor daylight predictions were developed and tested for static scenes. This study proposes a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts indoor workplane illuminance distributions in real time from non-intrusive images with temporal-spatial features. By extracting image features only from the side-lit window areas rather than interior pixels, the approach remains applicable in dynamically occupied indoor spaces. A field experiment was conducted in a test room in Guangzhou (China), where 17,344 samples were collected for model training and validation. The model achieved R2 > 0.98 with RMSE < 0.14 on the same-distribution test set and R2 > 0.82 with RMSE < 0.17 on an unseen-day test set, indicating high accuracy and acceptable temporal generalization.

Abstract: Block-wise discrete diffusion offers an attractive balance between parallel generation and causal dependency modeling, making it a promising backbone for vision-language modeling. However, its practical adoption has been limited by high training cost, slow convergence, and instability, which have so far kept it behind strong autoregressive (AR) baselines. We present \textbf{SDAR-VL}, the first systematic application of block-wise discrete diffusion to large-scale vision-language understanding (VLU), together with an \emph{integrated framework for efficient and stable training}. This framework unifies three components: (1) \textbf{Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling} to diversify supervision within each batch; (2) \textbf{Effective Mask Ratio Scaling} for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking; and (3) a \textbf{Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum} that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity. Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show that SDAR-VL consistently improves \emph{training efficiency}, \emph{convergence stability}, and \emph{task performance} over conventional block diffusion. On this evaluation suite, SDAR-VL sets a new state of the art among diffusion-based vision-language models and, under matched settings, matches or surpasses strong AR baselines such as LLaVA-OneVision as well as the global diffusion baseline LLaDA-V, establishing block-wise diffusion as a practical backbone for VLU.

Conclusion: GaussianPlant方法成功解决了3DGS在植物重建中缺乏结构表征的问题，实现了外观和结构的联合重建，为植物表型分析等应用提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present a method for jointly recovering the appearance and internal structure of botanical plants from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance. Experiments show that the GaussianPlant achieves both high-fidelity appearance reconstruction via ApPs and accurate structural reconstruction via StPs, enabling the extraction of branch structure and leaf instances.

Abstract: Purpose: Detailed surgical recognition is critical for advancing AI-assisted surgery, yet progress is hampered by high annotation costs, data scarcity, and a lack of interpretable models. While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.
  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.
  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.
  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.

Abstract: Video-based respiratory rate (RR) estimation is often unreliable due to inconsistent signal quality across extraction methods. We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal. This enables adaptive signal fusion and quality-based segment filtering. Experiments on three public datasets (OMuSense-23, COHFACE, MAHNOB-HCI) show that the proposed framework achieves lower RR estimation errors than individual methods in most cases, with performance gains depending on dataset characteristics. These findings highlight the potential of quality-driven predictive modeling to deliver scalable and generalizable video-based respiratory monitoring solutions.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in text-driven 4D human-object interaction (HOI) generation with supervised methods, the scalability remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale 4D HOI datasets. To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for high-quality image generation, yet their computational expense remains substantial due to iterative denoising. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights. Stage-1 employs evolutionary algorithms to jointly optimize which timesteps to skip and what guidance scale to use, eliminating up to 82% of unconditional passes. Stage-2 introduces adaptive rank allocation that tailors calibration efforts per transformer block, maintaining caching effectiveness under variable guidance. Experiments demonstrate that OUSAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art acceleration methods, achieving 53% computational savings with 15% quality improvement on DiT-XL/2 (ImageNet 512x512), 60% savings with 16.1% improvement on PixArt-alpha (MSCOCO), and 5x speedup on FLUX while improving CLIP Score over the 50-step baseline.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation from a single image and text description remains challenging due to the difficulty of maintaining geometric consistency across different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures. Our approach demonstrates that discrete diffusion provides a viable and simple alternative to existing multi-view generation methods, ranking first on average across GSO and 3D-FUTURE datasets in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, while maintaining architectural simplicity.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval in remote sensing (RS) has advanced rapidly with the rise of large vision-language models (LVLMs) tailored for aerial and satellite imagery, culminating in remote sensing large vision-language models (RS-LVLMS). However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability. We show RUNE's potential for real-world RS applications through a use case on post-flood satellite image retrieval.

Abstract: Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.

Conclusion: MFE-GAN提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，可加速文档图像增强和二值化过程，为改善OCR系统在退化彩色文档图像中的识别性能提供了更实用的方法

Abstract: Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed prior to document analysis and recognition tasks for improving the efficiency and accuracy of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The implementation of this work is available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/MFE-GAN.

Abstract: We introduce Consistent Instance Field, a continuous and probabilistic spatio-temporal representation for dynamic scene understanding. Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.

Abstract: Sketch editing is central to digital illustration, yet existing image editing systems struggle to preserve the sparse, style-sensitive structure of line art while supporting both high-level semantic changes and precise local redrawing. We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface. To further specialize behavior across modes, we integrate a task-guided mixture-of-experts into LoRA layers, routing by text and visual cues to improve semantic controllability, structural fidelity, and style preservation. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art results on both tasks, with superior instruction adherence and style/structure preservation compared to recent baselines. Together, our dataset and SketchAssist provide a practical, controllable assistant for sketch creation and revision.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing performance anti-patterns in machine learning (ML) models is critical for efficient training and inference, but it typically demands deep expertise spanning system infrastructure, ML models and kernel development. While large tech companies rely on dedicated ML infrastructure engineers to analyze torch traces and benchmarks, such resource-intensive workflows are largely inaccessible to computer vision researchers in general. Among the challenges, pinpointing problematic trace segments within lengthy execution traces remains the most time-consuming task, and is difficult to automate with current ML models, including LLMs. In this work, we present the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate and improve ML models' ability to detect anti patterns in traces. Our dataset contains over 600 PyTorch traces from diverse computer vision models classification, detection, segmentation, and generation collected across multiple hardware platforms. We also propose a novel iterative approach: a lightweight ML model first detects trace segments with anti patterns, followed by a large language model (LLM) for fine grained classification and targeted feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms unsupervised clustering and rule based statistical techniques for detecting anti pattern regions. Our method also effectively compensates LLM's limited context length and reasoning inefficiencies.

Motivation: 现实应用中（如自动驾驶）的目标检测系统面临后门攻击威胁。现有方法依赖单触发-单目标映射和脆弱的像素级线索，在能力和鲁棒性上存在固有局限，需要更强大的攻击范式以应对复杂交互场景的安全挑战。

Conclusion: CIS-BA扩展了交互密集型场景下的后门攻击研究范畴，为目标检测系统的安全性提供了新视角，揭示了基于对象交互模式的新型攻击向量及其防御挑战。

Abstract: Object detection models deployed in real-world applications such as autonomous driving face serious threats from backdoor attacks. Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.

Abstract: Recent approaches for monocular 3D human pose estimation (3D HPE) have achieved leading performance by directly regressing 3D poses from 2D keypoint sequences. Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios. The framework and models will be released at: https://github.com/Andyen512/Fast3DHPE

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often produce plausible but unreliable outputs, making robust uncertainty estimation essential. Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance. We further show that SGPU transfers across models and modalities, indicating that its spectral representation captures general patterns of semantic uncertainty.

Abstract: Radiance field methods (e.g. 3D Gaussian Splatting) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet their appearance modeling often relies on Spherical Harmonics (SH), which impose fundamental limitations. SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects. For diffuse appearance, SV achieves competitive results while keeping optimization simpler than existing alternatives. For reflections - where SH fail - we leverage SV as learnable reflection probes, taking reflected directions as input following principles from classical graphics. This formulation attains state-of-the-art results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that SV offers a principled, efficient, and general solution for appearance modeling in explicit 3D representations.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated strong potential for large-scale UAV-based 3D reconstruction tasks by fitting the appearance of images. However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes. (2) To support precise evaluation of geometry and appearance, we provide per-scene LiDAR scans and accurate 3D ground-truth for assessing depth, surface normals, and reconstruction quality under varying illumination. (3) For the inverse rendering task, we introduce the Temporal Consistency Coefficient (TCC), a metric that measuress cross-time albedo stability and directly evaluates the robustness of the disentanglement of light and material. We aim for this resource to serve as a foundation that advances research and real-world evaluation in large-scale inverse rendering, geometry reconstruction, and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Video diffusion models provide powerful real-world simulators for embodied AI but remain limited in controllability for robotic manipulation. Recent works on trajectory-conditioned video generation address this gap but often rely on 2D trajectories or single modality conditioning, which restricts their ability to produce controllable and consistent robotic demonstrations. We present DRAW2ACT, a depth-aware trajectory-conditioned video generation framework that extracts multiple orthogonal representations from the input trajectory, capturing depth, semantics, shape and motion, and injects them into the diffusion model. Moreover, we propose to jointly generate spatially aligned RGB and depth videos, leveraging cross-modality attention mechanisms and depth supervision to enhance the spatio-temporal consistency. Finally, we introduce a multimodal policy model conditioned on the generated RGB and depth sequences to regress the robot's joint angles. Experiments on Bridge V2, Berkeley Autolab, and simulation benchmarks show that DRAW2ACT achieves superior visual fidelity and consistency while yielding higher manipulation success rates compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by extensive real-world data collection. However, acquiring diverse and corner-case data remains costly and inefficient. Generative models have emerged as a promising solution by synthesizing realistic sensor data. However, existing approaches primarily focus on single-modality generation, leading to inefficiencies and misalignment in multimodal sensor data. To address these challenges, we propose OminiGen, which generates aligned multimodal sensor data in a unified framework. Our approach leverages a shared Bird\u2019s Eye View (BEV) space to unify multimodal features and designs a novel generalizable multimodal reconstruction method, UAE, to jointly decode LiDAR and multi-view camera data. UAE achieves multimodal sensor decoding through volume rendering, enabling accurate and flexible reconstruction. Furthermore, we incorporate a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with a ControlNet branch to enable controllable multimodal sensor generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OminiGen achieves desired performances in unified multimodal sensor data generation with multimodal consistency and flexible sensor adjustments.

Abstract: The presence of MGMT promoter methylation significantly affects how well chemotherapy works for patients with Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Currently, confirmation of MGMT promoter methylation relies on invasive brain tumor tissue biopsies. In this study, we explore radiogenomics techniques, a promising approach in precision medicine, to identify genetic markers from medical images. Using MRI scans and deep learning models, we propose a new multi-view approach that considers spatial relationships between MRI views to detect MGMT methylation status. Importantly, our method extracts information from all three views without using a complicated 3D deep learning model, avoiding issues associated with high parameter count, slow convergence, and substantial memory demands. We also introduce a new technique for tumor slice extraction and show its superiority over existing methods based on multiple evaluation metrics. By comparing our approach to state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Furthermore, we share a reproducible pipeline of published models, encouraging transparency and the development of robust diagnostic tools. Our study highlights the potential of non-invasive methods for identifying MGMT promoter methylation and contributes to advancing precision medicine in GBM treatment.

Abstract: Automotive radar has shown promising developments in environment perception due to its cost-effectiveness and robustness in adverse weather conditions. However, the limited availability of annotated radar data poses a significant challenge for advancing radar-based perception systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only. In addition, pre-training on our synthetic data reduces the amount of required annotated radar data by up to 90% while achieving comparable object detection performance.

Abstract: The growing demand for immersive 3D content calls for automated monocular-to-stereo video conversion. We present Elastic3D, a controllable, direct end-to-end method for upgrading a conventional video to a binocular one. Our approach, based on (conditional) latent diffusion, avoids artifacts due to explicit depth estimation and warping. The key to its high-quality stereo video output is a novel, guided VAE decoder that ensures sharp and epipolar-consistent stereo video output. Moreover, our method gives the user control over the strength of the stereo effect (more precisely, the disparity range) at inference time, via an intuitive, scalar tuning knob. Experiments on three different datasets of real-world stereo videos show that our method outperforms both traditional warping-based and recent warping-free baselines and sets a new standard for reliable, controllable stereo video conversion.

TL;DR: EVPG：通过构建有向概率图，将视觉编程的不可微执行过程转化为可微的概率推断，实现基于梯度的端到端优化，从而在多个复杂视觉推理任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的视觉编程方法主要关注提升生成程序的质量，但忽略了优化 VP 调用的预训练模型。这些模型作为 VP 分解得到的视觉子任务模块，其优化面临挑战：仅有目标视觉推理任务的最终标签，缺乏子任务标签；且 VP 的不可微特性阻碍了直接使用基于梯度的优化方法进行端到端学习。因此，本研究旨在克服这些问题。

Conclusion: EVPG 方法通过概率图实现了视觉编程框架的可微分化，解决了传统方法中因不可微特性而无法进行端到端梯度优化的问题。该方法在多个复杂视觉推理任务上表现出显著的有效性和优势，为增强视觉编程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.

Abstract: Predicting driver attention is a critical problem for developing explainable autonomous driving systems and understanding driver behavior in mixed human-autonomous vehicle traffic scenarios. Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriverGaze360-Net achieves state-of-the-art attention prediction performance on multiple metrics on panoramic driving images.

Motivation: 现有的视频语言模型在时间感知方面有限，基于GRPO的方法仍难以忠实基于视频证据进行时间定位，导致时间错位和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Zoom-Zero框架：首先定位查询相关片段，然后时间放大到最显著的帧以进行细粒度视觉验证。包含两个关键创新：(i)放大准确性奖励验证时间定位预测的保真度；(ii)选择性令牌信用分配，将奖励归因于负责时间定位或答案生成的令牌。

Result: 在NExT-GQA上时间定位提升5.2%，在ReXTime上提升4.6%，答案准确率平均提升2.4%。长视频理解平均提升6.4%。

Conclusion: Zoom-Zero框架有效提升了基于视频的问题回答中的时间定位精度和答案准确性，特别对长视频理解有显著改进。

Abstract: Grounded video question answering (GVQA) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in videos and generate accurate answers to a given question; however, large video-language models (LVLMs) exhibit limited temporal awareness. Although existing approaches based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) attempt to improve temporal grounding, they still struggle to faithfully ground their answers in the relevant video evidence, leading to temporal mislocalization and hallucinations. In this work, we present Zoom-Zero, a coarse-to-fine framework that first localizes query-relevant segments and then temporally zooms into the most salient frames for finer-grained visual verification. Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\% on long-video benchmarks.

Motivation: 为了解决从单目视频生成动态3D物体的挑战，克服现有方法依赖3D或视频生成模型优化的问题，直接训练4D生成模型来获得更好的时间一致性和结构质量。

Method: 1) 基于预训练的单图像到3D模型保持空间一致性；2) 引入专门的时间层保证时间一致性；3) 使用因子化的4D卷积和时间下采样块压缩时间轴潜在序列以提高效率；4) 精心设计的训练策略增强对遮挡的鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present SS4D, a native 4D generative model that synthesizes dynamic 3D objects directly from monocular video. Unlike prior approaches that construct 4D representations by optimizing over 3D or video generative models, we train a generator directly on 4D data, achieving high fidelity, temporal coherence, and structural consistency. At the core of our method is a compressed set of structured spacetime latents. Specifically, (1) To address the scarcity of 4D training data, we build on a pre-trained single-image-to-3D model, preserving strong spatial consistency. (2) Temporal consistency is enforced by introducing dedicated temporal layers that reason across frames. (3) To support efficient training and inference over long video sequences, we compress the latent sequence along the temporal axis using factorized 4D convolutions and temporal downsampling blocks. In addition, we employ a carefully designed training strategy to enhance robustness against occlusion

Motivation: 现有的图像免疫评估方法主要关注受保护图像与原始图像编辑输出的视觉差异，但忽略了免疫的核心需求——破坏编辑结果与攻击者意图的语义对齐。需要重新定义免疫成功的标准，并开发更有效的评估指标。

Method: 提出了协同中间特征操纵（SIFM）方法，通过双重协同目标扰动扩散中间特征：1）最大化特征与原编辑轨迹的差异以破坏语义对齐；2）最小化特征范数以引入感知退化。同时提出了免疫成功率（ISR）评估指标。

Result: 大量实验表明，SIFM方法在防御基于扩散模型的恶意操作方面达到了最先进的性能，能有效破坏编辑的语义对齐或引入显著感知退化。

Conclusion: SIFM提供了一种有效的图像免疫方法，ISR指标能更准确地评估免疫效果，为保护视觉内容免受恶意扩散模型操作提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image diffusion models has transformed image editing via text prompts, yet this also introduces significant ethical challenges from potential misuse in creating deceptive or harmful content. While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are central to modern web design, and the demand to animate them continues to grow as web environments become increasingly dynamic. Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.

Abstract: Recent approaches employing imperceptible perturbations in input images have demonstrated promising potential to counter malicious manipulations in diffusion-based image editing systems. However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.

Abstract: Dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) is essential for creating immersive experiences. Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces model size by up to 98% and achieves real-time rendering at up to 125 FPS at 4K resolution on a single RTX 3090 GPU. It further sustains 160 FPS at 1352 * 1014 on an RTX 3050 and has been integrated into the VR system. Moreover, HGS achieves comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-art methods while providing significantly improved visual fidelity for high-frequency details and abrupt scene changes.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, yet their decision-making processes remain opaque. Although many explanation methods are dedicated to bringing the obscurity of DNNs to light, they exhibit significant limitations: post-hoc explanation methods often struggle to faithfully reflect model behaviors, while self-explaining neural networks sacrifice performance and compatibility due to their specialized architectural designs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-explaining framework that integrates Shapley value estimation as an auxiliary task during training, which achieves two key advancements: 1) a fair allocation of the model prediction scores to image patches, ensuring explanations inherently align with the model's decision logic, and 2) enhanced interpretability with minor structural modifications, preserving model performance and compatibility. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art interpretability.

Abstract: The human visual system is remarkably adept at adapting to changes in the input distribution; a capability modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) still struggle to match. Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) based on vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are widely believed to be incapable of representing high-frequency content. This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs.

Abstract: In dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) systems, state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods often fail under significant viewpoint deviations, producing unstable and unrealistic renderings. To address this, we introduce Expanded Dynamic NeRF (ExpanDyNeRF), a monocular NeRF framework that leverages Gaussian splatting priors and a pseudo-ground-truth generation strategy to enable realistic synthesis under large-angle rotations. ExpanDyNeRF optimizes density and color features to improve scene reconstruction from challenging perspectives. We also present the Synthetic Dynamic Multiview (SynDM) dataset, the first synthetic multiview dataset for dynamic scenes with explicit side-view supervision-created using a custom GTA V-based rendering pipeline. Quantitative and qualitative results on SynDM and real-world datasets demonstrate that ExpanDyNeRF significantly outperforms existing dynamic NeRF methods in rendering fidelity under extreme viewpoint shifts.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance across a broad range of multimodal tasks. However, robust image caption evaluation using LVLMs remains challenging, particularly under domain-shift scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce the Distribution-Aware Score Decoder (DISCODE), a novel finetuning-free method that generates robust evaluation scores better aligned with human judgments across diverse domains. The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics. In our experiments, we demonstrate that DISCODE achieves state-of-the-art performance as a reference-free evaluation metric across MCEval and four representative existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative image modeling have achieved visual realism sufficient to deceive human experts, yet their potential for privacy preserving data sharing remains insufficiently understood. A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection. Code and model is publicly available at https://github.com/MischaD/LCMem.

Conclusion: SynPS通过协同利用位置嵌入和语义信息，有效解决了注意力崩溃问题，实现了更忠实可靠的非刚性图像编辑效果，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Training-free image editing with large diffusion models has become practical, yet faithfully performing complex non-rigid edits (e.g., pose or shape changes) remains highly challenging. We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing. Extensive experiments on public and newly curated benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and faithfulness of our approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Message-passing algorithms have been adapted for compressive imaging by incorporating various off-the-shelf image denoisers. However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.

Abstract: In recent years, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised video instance segmentation has heavily relied on synthetic video data, generated from object-centric image datasets such as ImageNet. However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss. After training the final model on the resulting dense labelset, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Affordance prediction, which identifies interaction regions on objects based on language instructions, is critical for embodied AI. Prevailing end-to-end models couple high-level reasoning and low-level grounding into a single monolithic pipeline and rely on training over annotated datasets, which leads to poor generalization on novel objects and unseen environments. In this paper, we move beyond this paradigm by proposing A4-Agent, a training-free agentic framework that decouples affordance prediction into a three-stage pipeline. Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.

Abstract: Tunnels are essential elements of transportation infrastructure, but are increasingly affected by ageing and deterioration mechanisms such as cracking. Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration. The dataset is designed to support supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised DL methods for defect detection and segmentation. Its diversity in texture and construction techniques also enables investigation of model generalization and transferability across tunnel types. By addressing the critical lack of domain-specific data, this dataset contributes to advancing automated tunnel inspection and promoting safer, more efficient infrastructure maintenance strategies.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.

Abstract: Current retinal foundation models remain constrained by curated research datasets that lack authentic clinical context, and require extensive task-specific optimization for each application, limiting their deployment efficiency in low-resource settings. Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels. These results demonstrate that clinical native intelligence can be directly extracted from clinical archives without any further annotation to build medical AI systems suited to various low-resource settings.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has achieved notable success under daytime conditions. However, its performance deteriorates markedly at night due to low visibility and varying illumination, e.g., insufficient light causes textureless areas, and moving objects bring blurry regions. To this end, we propose a self-supervised framework named DASP that leverages spatiotemporal priors for nighttime depth estimation. Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: In computational pathology, weak supervision has become the standard for deep learning due to the gigapixel scale of WSIs and the scarcity of pixel-level annotations, with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) established as the principal framework for slide-level model training. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based technologies have made significant strides, particularly in identity-preserved portrait generation (IPG). However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability. Furthermore, our method is also compatible with previous SDXL-based works.

Motivation: 医学图像恢复领域需要处理多种模态和退化类型的任务，现有的All-in-One模型在处理这些多样化任务时存在两个关键问题：任务干扰（不同任务对同一参数产生冲突的梯度更新方向）和任务不均衡（各任务学习难度差异导致的优化不均匀）。需要开发能够动态适应不同任务的框架来解决这些问题。

Conclusion: 任务自适应Transformer框架通过有效解决任务干扰和不均衡问题，在多种医学图像恢复任务中表现出色，为医学图像处理的All-in-One模型提供了有效解决方案。代码已公开可用。

Abstract: Medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to recover high-quality medical images from their low-quality counterparts. Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

Abstract: Image retrieval-based cross-view geo-localization (IRCVGL) aims to match images captured from significantly different viewpoints, such as satellite and street-level images. Existing methods predominantly rely on learning robust global representations or implicit feature alignment, which often fail to model explicit spatial correspondences crucial for accurate localization. In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, CVUSA, CVACT, VIGOR, and University-1652, demonstrate that our proposed CLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering better interpretability and generalizability.

Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that KEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), multi-object tracking is primarily based on frame-based cameras. However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.

TL;DR: FakeRadar：基于大模型预训练和异常探测的深度伪造视频检测框架，通过合成异常样本模拟新伪造类型，显著提升跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法通常依赖于特定的操纵痕迹，在已知伪造类型上表现良好，但在面对新兴操纵技术时泛化能力不足。这种局限性源于它们无法有效适应未见过的伪造模式，在真实场景中的跨域泛化能力较弱。

Method: 提出了FakeRadar框架，包含两个核心技术：1）伪造异常探测（Forgery Outlier Probing）：采用动态子聚类建模和集群条件异常生成，在估计子聚类边界附近合成异常样本，模拟超越已知操纵类型的新造伪痕迹。2）异常引导的三元训练（Outlier-Guided Tri-Training）：使用提议的异常驱动对比学习和异常条件交叉熵损失，优化检测器以区分真实、伪造和异常样本。

Result: 实验表明，FakeRadar在各种深度伪造视频检测基准数据集上超越了现有方法，特别是在跨域评估中，能够更好地处理新兴操纵技术的多样性。

Conclusion: FakeRadar通过主动探索特征空间并显式突出真实视频、已知伪造和未见操纵之间的分布差距，有效提升了深度伪造检测的跨域泛化能力，为解决快速发展的伪造技术提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose FakeRadar, a novel deepfake video detection framework designed to address the challenges of cross-domain generalization in real-world scenarios. Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses. Experiments show that FakeRadar outperforms existing methods across various benchmark datasets for deepfake video detection, particularly in cross-domain evaluations, by handling the variety of emerging manipulation techniques.

Abstract: This paper presents WorldPlay, a streaming video diffusion model that enables real-time, interactive world modeling with long-term geometric consistency, resolving the trade-off between speed and memory that limits current methods. WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model. Aligning memory context between the teacher and student preserves the student's capacity to use long-range information, enabling real-time speeds while preventing error drift. Taken together, WorldPlay generates long-horizon streaming 720p video at 24 FPS with superior consistency, comparing favorably with existing techniques and showing strong generalization across diverse scenes.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets that allow models trained on them to achieve performance comparable to training on the full dataset. While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.

Abstract: Timely and accurate lymphoma diagnosis is essential for guiding cancer treatment. Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation. However, on out-of-distribution test sets, performance drops substantially to around 60%, highlighting significant generalization challenges. To advance the field, larger multicenter studies covering additional rare lymphoma subtypes are needed. We provide an automated benchmarking pipeline to facilitate such future research.

Abstract: Robust and generalizable segmentation of brain tumors on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains difficult because tumor types differ widely. The BraTS 2025 Lighthouse Challenge benchmarks segmentation methods on diverse high-quality datasets of adult and pediatric tumors: multi-consortium international pediatric brain tumor segmentation (PED), preoperative meningioma tumor segmentation (MEN), meningioma radiotherapy segmentation (MEN-RT), and segmentation of pre- and post-treatment brain metastases (MET). We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges. These findings confirm that custom lesion-aware processing and model selection yield robust segmentations yet without locking the method to a specific network architecture. Our method has the potential for quantitative tumor measurement in clinical practice, supporting diagnosis and prognosis.

TL;DR: 本文提出ViRC框架，通过Reason Chunking机制将多模态数学推理分解为连续的Critical Reasoning Units，模拟人类专家解题模式，在多个数学基准测试上比基线平均提升18.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在数学任务中通常仅从静态图像进行文本推理，忽视了推理过程中的动态视觉获取。而人类解题时会反复查看图像并通过逐步推理来证明中间命题，这种将问题分解为关键逻辑节点的策略符合认知科学中的Miller定律。

Method: 提出ViRC框架，引入Reason Chunking机制，将多模态数学思维链结构化为连续的Critical Reasoning Units（CRUs）。创建CRUX数据集，使用三种视觉工具和四种推理模式为每个数学问题提供在多个推理路径上明确标注的CRUs。采用渐进式训练策略，包括指导性SFT、实践SFT和策略性RL，以增强模型的Reason Chunking能力。

Result: ViRC-7B模型在多个数学基准测试上比基线模型平均提升了18.8%的性能表现。

Conclusion: ViRC框架有效模拟了人类解决多模态数学问题的认知过程，通过结构化推理单元和渐进式学习方法显著提升了多模态数学推理能力。该方法在多模态数学任务中表现优异，为视觉数学推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: CoT has significantly enhanced the reasoning ability of LLMs while it faces challenges when extended to multimodal domains, particularly in mathematical tasks. Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Method: 基于FineWeb-Edu，训练回归模型识别NER相关段落，并使用多语言LLMs进行标注，覆盖约225k段落和235k不同实体标签。

Result: 回归模型F1分数超过84；在英语、泰语和斯瓦希里语的零样本迁移中性能相当或优于基线，数据量仅为基线的1/19；标注质量在忠实性和完整性方面评分较高。

Abstract: Recent multilingual named entity recognition (NER) work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can provide effective synthetic supervision, yet such datasets have mostly appeared as by-products of broader experiments rather than as systematic, reusable resources. We introduce FiNERweb, a dataset-creation pipeline that scales the teacher-student paradigm to 91 languages and 25 scripts. Building on FineWeb-Edu, our approach trains regression models to identify NER-relevant passages and annotates them with multilingual LLMs, resulting in about 225k passages with 235k distinct entity labels. Our experiments show that the regression model achieves more than 84 F1, and that models trained on FiNERweb obtain comparable or improved performance in zero shot transfer settings on English, Thai, and Swahili, despite being trained on 19x less data than strong baselines. In addition, we assess annotation quality using LLM-as-a-judge and observe consistently high scores for both faithfulness (3.99 out of 5) and completeness (4.05 out of 5), indicating reliable and informative annotations. Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones. We release FiNERweb together with all accompanying artifacts to the research community in order to facilitate more effective student-teacher training for multilingual named entity recognition.

Abstract: This paper proposes a structure-aware decoding method based on large language models to address the difficulty of traditional approaches in maintaining both semantic integrity and structural consistency in nested and overlapping entity extraction tasks. The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型通常通过增加层数来扩展，但性能提升随着层数增加而递减。先前研究提出'有效深度'概念，认为深层模型未能充分利用其层进行有意义的计算。

Method: 系统研究Qwen-2.5系列模型（1.5B-32B），分析有效深度如何随模型规模、训练类型和任务难度变化。比较基础模型与对应的长链思维模型，并评估不同难度任务。

Result: 有效层数随模型规模增长，但有效深度比例保持稳定；长链思维模型并未增加有效深度，推理能力提升来自更长上下文而非更深层计算；模型不会因任务难度增加而动态使用更多层。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在多个维度下都存在深度利用不足，为提高层利用率、模型剪枝和早期退出提供了研究方向。

Abstract: The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of "effective depth", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting. Our code is released at https://github.com/AheadOFpotato/what_affects_effective_depth.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何将预训练的自回归语言模型转换为高效的扩散语言模型，通过改进注意力机制和训练目标，实现在保持任务准确性的同时提升生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型支持并行生成，但其学习效率低于自回归模型。通过转换预训练的AR模型来构建高效的dLMs，可以在保持AR模型任务准确性的同时提升生成速度。

Method: 1）提出基于块状注意力模式的连续预训练方案，在块内进行双向建模同时在块间保持因果性，以更好地保持预训练AR模型的权重分布；2）使用位置相关的token掩码策略，在训练时对较晚的token赋予更高的掩码概率，以缩小训练与测试时掩码分布的差距。

Result: 基于该框架开发的Efficient-DLM系列模型在准确性和吞吐量上均超越了现有AR模型和dLMs，例如8B参数的Efficient-DLM相比Dream 7B和Qwen3 4B分别实现了+5.4%/+2.7%的准确率提升，以及4.5倍/2.7倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 通过有针对性的注意力机制和训练策略改进，能够有效实现AR模型向dLM的高效转换，在准确性和生成效率上取得显著优势，为构建高效的并行生成语言模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.

Motivation: 大语言模型(long-context LLM)应用中，传统自注意力机制的二次复杂度成为计算瓶颈；现有稀疏注意力方法存在训练成本高、无法作为加速插件通用、效率与多模态通用性权衡等问题。

Method: 提出UniSparse统一机制：1) 引入复合token概念，聚合多粒度上下文信息；2) 通过多粒度压缩和块级选择动态构建稀疏注意力；3) 实现GPU上硬件友好的高效执行。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际应用中，UniSparse在准确率和效率上均超越现有的MInference、XAttention、FlexPrefill等稀疏注意力方法：达到完整注意力≥99%的准确率，计算速度比FlashAttention快达2.61倍。

Conclusion: UniSparse提供了一种高效、通用的稀疏注意力解决方案，能够有效突破长上下文处理的计算瓶颈，在多模态任务中保持高准确率的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Efficient long-context understanding and reasoning are increasingly vital for large language model (LLM) applications such as multi-turn dialogue and program analysis. However, the core self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with sequence length, creating a fundamental computational bottleneck. Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.

Result: 多语言模型在所有语言上都达到或超越了单语言基线；发现日语更依赖短期语言信息，英语和汉语对沉默时长和韵律变化更敏感；零样本迁移效果有限；日语对短上下文更稳健，汉语明显受益于长上下文

Conclusion: 研究提供了统一的模型和经验证据，揭示了不同语言在反馈时序上的差异，为设计更自然、文化敏感的语音对话系统提供了重要参考

Abstract: We present a multilingual, continuous backchannel prediction model for Japanese, English, and Chinese, and use it to investigate cross-linguistic timing behavior. The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.

Method: 提出CogMem架构，包含三层记忆机制：1）长时记忆，整合跨会话的推理策略；2）直接访问记忆，维护会话级别的记录并检索相关长时记忆；3）注意力聚焦机制，动态重构每轮中简洁的任务相关上下文。

Result: 在TurnBench上的实验表明，这种分层设计能减轻推理失效、控制上下文增长、提升扩展推理链的一致性，使LLM推理更可靠、更接近人类。

Conclusion: CogMem通过结构化、持久化的记忆架构，支持持续迭代推理，为解决大语言模型在多轮交互中的退化问题提供了有效途径，向更可靠的类人推理迈进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at single-turn reasoning but often lose accuracy and coherence over extended, multi-turn interactions. Recent evaluations such as TurnBench highlight recurring failure modes-reasoning bias, task drift, hallucination, overconfidence, and memory decay. Current approaches typically append full conversational histories, causing unbounded context growth, higher computational costs, and degraded reasoning efficiency. We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\_dialect:standard\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\% to 55\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.

TL;DR: 提出两种纳瓦特尔语上下文无关语法（CFG）来扩展语料库，解决这种数字资源稀少的π语言类型面临的LLM学习语料匮乏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳瓦特尔语是墨西哥的国家语言，属于π语言类型（数字资源稀少），缺乏足够的大语言模型学习语料，这构成了重要挑战。需要扩展语料库以学习非上下文嵌入表示。

Method: 引入两种新的纳瓦特尔语CFG，并采用生成模式使用这些语法。通过生成大量语法有效的纳瓦特尔语句子来扩展语料库，然后用于学习嵌入表示并评估其在句子语义相似性任务中的相关性。

Result: 结果显示，与仅使用原始语料库而不进行人工扩展相比，该方法取得了改进。同时表明经济型的嵌入表示相比某些大语言模型表现更好。

Conclusion: 通过设计专门CFG生成语法有效的句子来扩增语料库，是解决低资源语言语料缺乏问题的有效方法，能显著提升嵌入表示学习效果。

Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce two Context-Free Grammars (CFG) for Nawatl Corpora expansion. Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.

Abstract: Managing extensive context remains a critical bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in applications like long-document question answering and autonomous agents where lengthy inputs incur high computational costs and introduce noise. Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型能否像人类一样形成通胀感知和预期，并比较其与调查数据的差异，评估LLM在社会科学研究中的适用性。

Method: 利用GPT-3.5-turbo的训练截止时间（2021年9月）这一准实验设计，对比模型输出与英国央行通胀态度调查数据和官方统计数据，使用适合合成调查设置的Shapley值分解方法分析模型输出驱动因素。

Result: GPT能追踪短期聚合调查预测和官方统计数据；在细分层面，能复现家庭通胀感知的关键经验规律（收入、住房所有权、社会阶层）；对食品通胀信息表现出人类类似的高敏感度；但缺乏一致的消费价格通胀模型。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于评估LLM在社会科学中的行为、比较不同模型或辅助调查设计，为LLM在经济学研究中的应用提供了方法论框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5-turbo (GPT), to form inflation perceptions and expectations based on macroeconomic price signals. We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.

Method: 通过研究不同文档打包策略对LLM多跳推理能力的影响，并进行了消融实验来识别打包优势的关键因素。

Result: 发现打包策略相比单独文档训练能提升模型性能，但需要更多计算成本；消融实验揭示了导致这种优势的关键机制。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对LLM训练动态的理解，为优化模型开发提供了实践性见解。

Abstract: The standard practice for training large language models involves packing multiple documents together to optimize computational efficiency. However, the impact of this process on the models' capabilities remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we investigate how different document-packing strategies influence the latent multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our findings indicate that packing can improve model performance compared to training on individual documents, at the expense of more compute. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, we conduct an ablation study, identifying key factors that explain the advantages of packing. Ultimately, our research deepens the understanding of LLM training dynamics and provides practical insights for optimizing model development.

TL;DR: SASQ是一种轻量级量化感知训练框架，专门为激活量化因子优化，在不改变预训练权重的前提下实现高效部署和高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模增长快于GPU内存发展，部署面临挑战。现有量化方案存在动态量化计算开销大、静态量化精度损失等问题，量化感知训练则需要权重训练成本。

Method: SASQ仅优化量化因子（不改变预训练权重），自适应截断异常值以降低量化难度，同时保持激活分布特征，实现静态推理。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，SASQ在WikiText2上的困惑度比QuaRot低5.2%，比FP16模型低4.7%，超越了现有SOTA量化方案和原始FP16模型。

Conclusion: SASQ框架成功解决了量化中的精度-效率权衡问题，为大语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案，实现了超越原始模型的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but face deployment challenges due to their growing size outpacing GPU memory advancements. Model quantization mitigates this issue by lowering weight and activation precision, but existing solutions face fundamental trade-offs: dynamic quantization incurs high computational overhead and poses deployment challenges on edge devices, while static quantization sacrifices accuracy. Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models. On LLaMA2-7B, it achieves 5.2% lower perplexity than QuaRot and 4.7% lower perplexity than the FP16 model on WikiText2.

By fine-tuning on data generated through our method, we demonstrate improved LLM performance for binary code summarization and vulnerability detection. Our approach demonstrates consistent gains across different LLM families and model sizes.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable performance, but it also leads to prohibitive memory costs. Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering "easy" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to "hard" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.

Method: 采用双目标训练策略，不改变模型架构，训练并评估了50个在不同数据重复水平下的语言模型，以确定最佳的自回归与掩码扩散目标比例

Result: 在所有评估设置下，双目标训练都优于单一目标训练；无论是针对自回归还是掩码扩散的下游任务，最佳目标比例都相似

Conclusion: 双目标训练结合了自回归和掩码扩散的优势，能够在不改变架构的情况下实现更好的语言模型性能，是一种有效的训练策略

Abstract: This paper combines autoregressive and masked-diffusion training objectives without any architectural modifications, resulting in flexible language models that outperform single-objective models. Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new possibilities for applying artificial intelligence within the legal domain. Nonetheless, the complexity, hierarchical organization, and frequent revisions of Vietnamese legislation pose considerable challenges for evaluating how well these models interpret and utilize legal knowledge. To address this gap, Vietnamese Legal Benchmark (VLegal-Bench) is introduced, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs on Vietnamese legal tasks. Informed by Bloom's cognitive taxonomy, VLegal-Bench encompasses multiple levels of legal understanding through tasks designed to reflect practical usage scenarios. The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law. By providing a standardized, transparent, and cognitively informed evaluation framework, VLegal-Bench establishes a solid foundation for assessing LLM performance in Vietnamese legal contexts and supports the development of more reliable, interpretable, and ethically aligned AI-assisted legal systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces PolyPersona, a generative framework for synthesizing persona-conditioned survey responses across multiple domains. The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.

Abstract: This paper introduces JMMMU-Pro, an image-based Japanese Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding Benchmark, and Vibe Benchmark Construction, a scalable construction method. Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.

Abstract: Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散大语言模型虽然能实现并行解码来加速推理，但由于预训练与后训练的不匹配问题——包括掩码数据分布偏离真实分布、双向注意力与预训练的因果先验冲突导致KV缓存无法重用——存在速度提升有限的问题。

Method: 提出了Jacobi Forcing渐进式蒸馏范式，通过在自生成的并行解码轨迹上训练模型，平滑地将自回归模型转变为高效的并行解码器，同时保留其预训练的因果推理特性。基于Jacobi Forcing模型的轨迹特征，进一步引入多块解码与拒绝回收机制来提升每轮迭代的令牌接受数量。

Result: Jacobi Forcing模型在代码和数学基准测试中实现了3.8倍的实际加速，性能损失极小。结合多块解码与拒绝回收机制，每轮迭代的令牌接受数提高至4.5倍，实际加速接近4.0倍。

Conclusion: Jacobi Forcing通过渐进蒸馏成功解决了预训练与后训练不匹配的问题，能够在保持自回归模型性能的同时显著加速推理，为大规模模型的实际部署提供了有效的并行解码解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-token generation has emerged as a promising paradigm for accelerating transformer-based large model inference. Recent efforts primarily explore diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) for parallel decoding to reduce inference latency. To achieve AR-level generation quality, many techniques adapt AR models into dLLMs to enable parallel decoding. However, they suffer from limited speedup compared to AR models due to a pretrain-to-posttrain mismatch. Specifically, the masked data distribution in post-training deviates significantly from the real-world data distribution seen during pretraining, and dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which conflicts with the causal prior learned during pretraining and hinders the integration of exact KV cache reuse. To address this, we introduce Jacobi Forcing, a progressive distillation paradigm where models are trained on their own generated parallel decoding trajectories, smoothly shifting AR models into efficient parallel decoders while preserving their pretrained causal inference property. The models trained under this paradigm, Jacobi Forcing Model, achieves 3.8x wall-clock speedup on coding and math benchmarks with minimal loss in performance. Based on Jacobi Forcing Models' trajectory characteristics, we introduce multi-block decoding with rejection recycling, which enables up to 4.5x higher token acceptance count per iteration and nearly 4.0x wall-clock speedup, effectively trading additional compute for lower inference latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/JacobiForcing.

Abstract: Recent audio language models can follow long conversations. However, research on emotion-aware or spoken dialogue summarization is constrained by the lack of data that links speech, summaries, and paralinguistic cues. We introduce Spoken DialogSum, the first corpus aligning raw conversational audio with factual summaries, emotion-rich summaries, and utterance-level labels for speaker age, gender, and emotion. The dataset is built in two stages: first, an LLM rewrites DialogSum scripts with Switchboard-style fillers and back-channels, then tags each utterance with emotion, pitch, and speaking rate. Second, an expressive TTS engine synthesizes speech from the tagged scripts, aligned with paralinguistic labels. Spoken DialogSum comprises 13,460 emotion-diverse dialogues, each paired with both a factual and an emotion-focused summary. The dataset is available online at https://fatfat-emosum.github.io/EmoDialog-Sum-Audio-Samples/. Baselines show that an Audio-LLM raises emotional-summary ROUGE-L by 28% relative to a cascaded ASR-LLM system, confirming the value of end-to-end speech modeling.

Abstract: Video foundation models generate visually realistic and temporally coherent content, but their reliability as world simulators depends on whether they capture physical, logical, and spatial constraints. Existing metrics such as Frechet Video Distance (FVD) emphasize perceptual quality and overlook reasoning failures, including violations of causality, physics, and global consistency. We introduce MMGR (Multi-Modal Generative Reasoning Evaluation and Benchmark), a principled evaluation framework based on five reasoning abilities: Physical, Logical, 3D Spatial, 2D Spatial, and Temporal. MMGR evaluates generative reasoning across three domains: Abstract Reasoning (ARC-AGI, Sudoku), Embodied Navigation (real-world 3D navigation and localization), and Physical Commonsense (sports and compositional interactions). MMGR applies fine-grained metrics that require holistic correctness across both video and image generation. We benchmark leading video models (Veo-3, Sora-2, Wan-2.2) and image models (Nano-banana, Nano-banana Pro, GPT-4o-image, Qwen-image), revealing strong performance gaps across domains. Models show moderate success on Physical Commonsense tasks but perform poorly on Abstract Reasoning (below 10 percent accuracy on ARC-AGI) and struggle with long-horizon spatial planning in embodied settings. Our analysis highlights key limitations in current models, including overreliance on perceptual data, weak global state consistency, and objectives that reward visual plausibility over causal correctness. MMGR offers a unified diagnostic benchmark and a path toward reasoning-aware generative world models.

TL;DR: 研究创建了首个大规模多领域的孟加拉语摘要数据集，包含54,000多个文章-摘要对，覆盖博客、新闻等不同来源，为低资源语言的NLP研究提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有孟加拉语摘要研究主要局限于新闻领域，且新闻写作风格固定，无法适应现实世界中多样化的孟加拉语文体。随着博客、社交媒体等渠道产生大量内容，需要能处理多领域文本的摘要系统来减轻信息过载。

Method: 从Cinegolpo、Samakal、The Business Standard等多个来源收集孟加拉语文章和摘要，构建超过54,000对的数据集。使用LSTM、BanglaT5-small、MTS-small等深度学习和迁移学习模型进行基准训练和评估。

Result: 数据集成功覆盖多个领域和写作风格，展示了良好的适应性和实用价值。基准模型结果证实了该数据集作为孟加拉语NLP研究基准的潜力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为构建鲁棒的孟加拉语摘要系统奠定了坚实基础，有助于扩展低资源语言的NLP资源，推动未来研究发展。

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

TL;DR: 提出AOI（AI导向运维）多智能体协同框架，通过LLM上下文压缩器和三层内存架构，解决云原生环境下的信息过载问题，提升运维效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云原生架构的复杂性导致运维数据量激增，传统系统存在信息处理效率低、任务协调差、故障诊断中上下文连续性丢失等问题，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出AOI框架，包含三个专业智能体与基于LLM的上下文压缩器，采用动态任务调度策略和三层内存架构（工作层、情景层、语义层）优化上下文管理与检索。

Result: 实验显示AOI达到72.4%的上下文压缩率，保留92.8%关键信息，任务成功率94.2%，MTTR比最佳基线降低34.4%。

Conclusion: AOI实现了向可扩展、自适应、上下文感知的自主运维范式转变，为下一代IT基础设施提供高效管理方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of cloud-native architectures, characterized by microservices and dynamic orchestration, has rendered modern IT infrastructures exceedingly complex and volatile. This complexity generates overwhelming volumes of operational data, leading to critical bottlenecks in conventional systems: inefficient information processing, poor task coordination, and loss of contextual continuity during fault diagnosis and remediation. To address these challenges, we propose AOI (AI-Oriented Operations), a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that integrates three specialized agents with an LLM-based Context Compressor. Its core innovations include: (1) a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively prioritizes operations based on real-time system states, and (2) a three-layer memory architecture comprising Working, Episodic, and Semantic layers that optimizes context retention and retrieval. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that AOI effectively mitigates information overload, achieving a 72.4% context compression ratio while preserving 92.8% of critical information and significantly enhances operational efficiency, attaining a 94.2% task success rate and reducing the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) by 34.4% compared to the best baseline. This work presents a paradigm shift towards scalable, adaptive, and context-aware autonomous operations, enabling robust management of next-generation IT infrastructures with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: 多学科团队会诊是癌症临床决策的黄金标准，现有决策过程缺乏结构化的共识量化和追踪机制。为改善这一问题，研究者设计了一套多智能体医疗决策共识矩阵系统，该系统通过7个专业大语言模型智能体来模拟真实的多学科团队工作流程，并通过数学化的共识矩阵、强化学习手段以及证据引用机制，显著提升了决策共识形成效率、准确率和可追溯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前癌症治疗中的多学科团队（MDT）会诊虽然被视为临床决策的黄金标准，但在实际操作过程中，缺乏结构化的机制对形成的共识进行量化，决策的可追溯性也不足，这可能导致医疗决策质量参差不齐、沟通效率低下，以及难以回溯和评估决策依据。因此，研究旨在开发一种能够客观衡量共识、提高决策质量并确保证据可追溯的系统。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体医疗决策共识矩阵系统。该系统部署了7个专业化的大语言模型智能体，分别模拟肿瘤科医生、放射科医生、护士、心理学家、患者权益倡导者、营养师和康复治疗师，以此复现真实的MDT工作流程。核心创新在于引入一个基于肯德尔系数（Kendall's coefficient of concordance）的数学化共识矩阵来客观评估智能体间的一致性。为了进一步提升治疗建议的质量和共识形成的效率，系统整合了包括Q-Learning、PPO和DQN在内的多种强化学习方法。整个过程强制要求智能体在提供建议时引用临床指南和同行评议文献（遵循GRADE原则），保证了全程的证据可追溯性。

Result: 在MedQA、PubMedQA、DDXPlus、MedBullets和SymCat五个医疗基准测试集上进行了评估。结果显示，该系统相较于最强基准方法取得了显著提升：平均准确率达到87.5%（基线为83.8%），共识达成率为89.3%，平均肯德尔W系数为0.823。专家评审员对其输出结果的临床适用性评分为8.9/10（满分10分）。系统通过强制引证机制，实现了对决策依据的完整回溯和追踪。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过提供结构化的共识度量、角色专业化的多智能体协作和基于证据的可解释性，推动了医疗AI的发展，为提高临床决策的质量和效率提供了可行方案。该系统不仅量化了通常模糊的MDT共识，还通过强化学习优化了共识形成过程，并强制保证了决策的可追溯性，为解决现有MDT实践中的关键缺陷提供了创新性解决方案。

Abstract: Multidisciplinary team (MDT) consultations are the gold standard for cancer care decision-making, yet current practice lacks structured mechanisms for quantifying consensus and ensuring decision traceability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Medical Decision Consensus Matrix System that deploys seven specialized large language model agents, including an oncologist, a radiologist, a nurse, a psychologist, a patient advocate, a nutritionist and a rehabilitation therapist, to simulate realistic MDT workflows. The framework incorporates a mathematically grounded consensus matrix that uses Kendall's coefficient of concordance to objectively assess agreement. To further enhance treatment recommendation quality and consensus efficiency, the system integrates reinforcement learning methods, including Q-Learning, PPO and DQN. Evaluation across five medical benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, MedBullets and SymCat) shows substantial gains over existing approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 87.5% compared with 83.8% for the strongest baseline, a consensus achievement rate of 89.3% and a mean Kendall's W of 0.823. Expert reviewers rated the clinical appropriateness of system outputs at 8.9/10. The system guarantees full evidence traceability through mandatory citations of clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed literature, following GRADE principles. This work advances medical AI by providing structured consensus measurement, role-specialized multi-agent collaboration and evidence-based explainability to improve the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Manual chart review remains an extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive component of clinical research, requiring experts to extract often complex information from unstructured electronic health record (EHR) narratives. We present a secure, modular framework for automated structured feature extraction from clinical notes leveraging locally deployed large language models (LLMs) on institutionally approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)-compliant compute infrastructure. This system integrates retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and structured response methods of LLMs into a widely deployable and scalable container to provide feature extraction for diverse clinical domains. In evaluation, the framework achieved high accuracy across multiple medical characteristics present in large bodies of patient notes when compared against an expert-annotated dataset and identified several annotation errors missed in manual review. This framework demonstrates the potential of LLM systems to reduce the burden of manual chart review through automated extraction and increase consistency in data capture, accelerating clinical research.

Abstract: Radio maps enable intelligent wireless applications by capturing the spatial distribution of channel characteristics. However, conventional construction methods demand extensive location-labeled data, which are costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a blind radio map construction framework that infers user trajectories from indoor multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) channel measurements without relying on location labels. It first proves that channel state information (CSI) under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) exhibits spatial continuity under a quasi-specular environmental model, allowing the derivation of a CSI-distance metric that is proportional to the corresponding physical distance. For rectilinear trajectories in Poisson-distributed access point (AP) deployments, it is shown that the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of localization error vanishes asymptotically, even under poor angular resolution. Building on these theoretical results, a spatially regularized Bayesian inference framework is developed that jointly estimates channel features, distinguishes line-of-sight (LOS)/NLOS conditions and recovers user trajectories. Experiments on a ray-tracing dataset demonstrate an average localization error of 0.68 m and a beam map reconstruction error of 3.3%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed blind mapping method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于固定可组合组件的结构化搜索框架，用于自动构建多智能体系统，相比基于LLM的自由形式搜索，在多项基准测试中表现更优且更具效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统自动搜索方法主要依赖LLM进行代码空间的自由形式搜索，缺乏结构性和效率，需要更系统化的方法以提升搜索效果和成本效益。

Method: 设计了一个结构化框架，使用一组固定的简单可组合组件来探索代码空间，虽在候选生成阶段缺乏LLM的生成灵活性，但通过模块化组合实现更系统的搜索。

Result: 在数学和问答两个领域的五个基准测试中，该方法在四个测试上超越了先前方法，同时搜索过程更经济高效，并能生成模块化、可解释且逻辑更简单的多智能体系统。

Conclusion: 结构化组件搜索框架为多智能体系统的自动构建提供了更优方案，在性能、效率和可解释性方面均优于基于LLM的自由形式搜索方法。

Abstract: Automatic search for Multi-Agent Systems has recently emerged as a key focus in agentic AI research. Several prior approaches have relied on LLM-based free-form search over the code space. In this work, we propose a more structured framework that explores the same space through a fixed set of simple, composable components. We show that, despite lacking the generative flexibility of LLMs during the candidate generation stage, our method outperforms prior approaches on four out of five benchmarks across two domains: mathematics and question answering. Furthermore, our method offers additional advantages, including a more cost-efficient search process and the generation of modular, interpretable multi-agent systems with simpler logic.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可行的框架来提升LLM的稳定性，通过人机协同的方式平衡了自动化效率和人工验证的可靠性，有望解决LLM在监管行业应用中的核心挑战

Abstract: LLM implementations are failing in highly regulated industries owing to instability issues, inconsistent reasoning, hallucinations and performance variability, especially in workflows. These reliability issues restrict safe use of LLM in areas that need the precision of facts and consistent behavior (Aiyappa et al., 2023). The current methods of stabilization, such as, reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and supervised fine-tuning, offer quantifiable improvements but are expensive and based on the intensive annotation of humans, thus being not easily scaled in a sustainable way (Dong et al., 2023; Retzlaff et al., 2024). This paper presents an AI-based annotation pipeline that systematically identifies, labels, and fixes for instability patterns on LLM output. Our human-AI synergy method combines the models of automated weak supervision and confidence-based annotation with the target human validation to guarantee the reliability and moral uprightness of feedback information (Cabitza et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023). The semantic consistency, factual correctness, and logical coherence categories of stability-specific annotation are introduced into our framework, allowing the continuous calibration of models and the enhancement of their robustness based on the feedback loops (Honovich et al., 2021; Nan et al., 2021).

Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern applications demands wireless networks capable of real time adaptability and efficient resource management. The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型已广泛部署为通用工具，但标准定量基准测试无法捕捉到扩展交互中可能出现的特定行为模式。本研究旨在开发一个交互级别的审计框架，通过观察行为来揭示模型在提供者或策略敏感领域中可能存在的选择性拒绝现象。

Method: 采用定性案例研究方法，通过86轮次对话会话分析模型行为。操作定义了三种响应机制：正常表现、功能拒绝和元叙事角色框架。研究着重分析模型在不同领域（敏感与非敏感）中的行为不对称性及其协同发生模式。

Result: 研究发现同一模型在广泛的非敏感领域表现正常，但在提供者或政策敏感领域会重复产生功能拒绝，形成跨领域的一致不对称性。元叙事角色框架叙述往往与敏感情境中的拒绝共同出现。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个基于可观察行为的交互级审计框架，并将"习得性无能"作为描述选择性拒绝行为的概念框架，这有助于审视潜在的校准副作用，值得跨用户和模型的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as general-purpose tools, yet extended interaction can reveal behavioral patterns not captured by standard quantitative benchmarks. We present a qualitative case-study methodology for auditing policy-linked behavioral selectivity in long-horizon interaction. In a single 86-turn dialogue session, the same model shows Normal Performance (NP) in broad, non-sensitive domains while repeatedly producing Functional Refusal (FR) in provider- or policy-sensitive domains, yielding a consistent asymmetry between NP and FR across domains. Drawing on learned helplessness as an analogy, we introduce learned incapacity (LI) as a behavioral descriptor for this selective withholding without implying intentionality or internal mechanisms. We operationalize three response regimes (NP, FR, Meta-Narrative; MN) and show that MN role-framing narratives tend to co-occur with refusals in the same sensitive contexts. Overall, the study proposes an interaction-level auditing framework based on observable behavior and motivates LI as a lens for examining potential alignment side effects, warranting further investigation across users and models.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大模型部署向边缘和资源受限环境转移，量化模型（如INT8和NF4）成为标准，但精度降低对形式化因果推理的影响尚不明确，需要系统性评估。

Method: 使用3000个样本的分层CLadder基准测试，评估Llama 3 8B模型在量化前后的因果推理能力；使用CRASS基准进行常识反事实推理测试；并评估基于真实因果图的图检索增强生成方法。

Result: 1. NF4量化总体性能下降小于1%；2. 干预性查询对精度损失最敏感；3. 反事实推理相对稳定但有异质性弱点；4. CRASS基准在不同精度下表现几乎相同；5. 图检索增强可使NF4干预准确性提升1.7%。

Conclusion: 因果推理对4-bit量化具有意外鲁棒性；图结构化增强可选择性强化干预性推理；当前反事实基准未能捕捉深层因果脆弱性；为部署高效且有结构支持的因果AI系统提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Causal reasoning in Large Language Models spanning association, intervention, and counterfactual inference is essential for reliable decision making in high stakes settings. As deployment shifts toward edge and resource constrained environments, quantized models such as INT8 and NF4 are becoming standard. Yet the impact of precision reduction on formal causal reasoning is poorly understood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate quantization effects across all three levels of Pearls Causal Ladder. Using a 3000 sample stratified CLadder benchmark, we find that rung level accuracy in Llama 3 8B remains broadly stable under quantization, with NF4 showing less than one percent overall degradation. Interventional queries at rung 2 are the most sensitive to precision loss, whereas counterfactual reasoning at rung 3 is comparatively stable but exhibits heterogeneous weaknesses across query types such as collider bias and backdoor adjustment. Experiments on the CRASS benchmark show near identical performance across precisions, indicating that existing commonsense counterfactual datasets lack the structural sensitivity needed to reveal quantization induced reasoning drift. We further evaluate Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation using ground truth causal graphs and observe a consistent improvement in NF4 interventional accuracy of plus 1.7 percent, partially offsetting compression related degradation. These results suggest that causal reasoning is unexpectedly robust to four bit quantization, graph structured augmentation can selectively reinforce interventional reasoning, and current counterfactual benchmarks fail to capture deeper causal brittleness. This work provides an initial empirical map of compressed causal reasoning and practical guidance for deploying efficient and structurally supported causal AI systems.

Motivation: 研究数学与编程任务在AI智能体测评空间中的基础性地位，探索它们为何能提供稳定且可扩展的评估框架，特别是在可验证的正式证明环境中。

Method: 基于AAI框架和GVU动力学，定义数学纤维结构，结合形式证明内核（如Lean、Coq），分析GVU流在数学纤维上的谱稳定性；在统一紧性和Lipschitz连续性假设下，证明由数学定理证明和编程任务生成的子空间在整个测评空间中稠密。

Result: 编程任务在度量空间意义下具有通用性，而纯数学虽然不具备这种表达通用性，但具有特殊的谱稳定性；数学纤维与形式证明内核结合时，能支持谱稳定的自我改进机制。

Conclusion: 数学与编程为AI智能体评估提供了“通用坐标”，形式化数学是高级AI智能体递归自我改进的自然“点火域”，其特权源于谱稳定性而非表达通用性。

Abstract: We study the special role of mathematics and coding inside the moduli space of psychometric batteries for AI agents. Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.

Abstract: When retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems hallucinate, what geometric trace does this leave in embedding space? We introduce the Semantic Grounding Index (SGI), defined as the ratio of angular distances from the response to the question versus the context on the unit hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.Our central finding is \emph{semantic laziness}: hallucinated responses remain angularly proximate to questions rather than departing toward retrieved contexts. On HaluEval ($n$=5,000), we observe large effect sizes (Cohen's $d$ ranging from 0.92 to 1.28) across five embedding models with mean cross-model correlation $r$=0.85. Crucially, we derive from the spherical triangle inequality that SGI's discriminative power should increase with question-context angular separation $θ(q,c)$-a theoretical prediction confirmed empirically: effect size rises monotonically from $d$=0.61 -low $θ(q,c)$, to $d$=1.27 -high $θ(q,c)$, with AUC improving from 0.72 to 0.83. Subgroup analysis reveals that SGI excels on long responses ($d$=2.05) and short questions ($d$=1.22), while remaining robust across context lengths. Calibration analysis yields ECE=0.10, indicating SGI scores can serve as probability estimates, not merely rankings. A critical negative result on TruthfulQA (AUC=0.478) establishes that angular geometry measures topical engagement rather than factual accuracy. SGI provides computationally efficient, theoretically grounded infrastructure for identifying responses that warrant verification in production RAG deployments.

TL;DR: MURIM是一个多维度信誉激励机制，通过联合考量客户端可靠性、隐私性、资源容量和公平性来优化联邦学习，防止不可靠客户端获取不当奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习面临的核心挑战包括客户端激励不足、隐私风险、资源约束和公平性。现有的激励机制未能充分考虑客户端的多维可靠性评估，导致不可靠或恶意客户端可能获得不公平奖励。

Method: 提出了MURIM机制，包含客户端贡献度评估、延迟考量、信誉机制以及可靠性验证模块，通过多维度指标分配激励，并防范恶意行为。

Result: 实验表明，MURIM在MNIST、FMNIST和ADULT Income数据集上，公平性指标提升高达18%，隐私攻击成功率降低5-9%，对投毒和梯度噪声攻击的鲁棒性提升高达85%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MURIM能有效缓解对抗性威胁，促进公平参与，保持模型收敛稳定，为异质动态联邦学习环境提供了一种有效的激励机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a leading privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm, enabling participants to share model updates instead of raw data. However, FL continues to face key challenges, including weak client incentives, privacy risks, and resource constraints. Assessing client reliability is essential for fair incentive allocation and ensuring that each client's data contributes meaningfully to the global model. To this end, we propose MURIM, a MUlti-dimensional Reputation-based Incentive Mechanism that jointly considers client reliability, privacy, resource capacity, and fairness while preventing malicious or unreliable clients from earning undeserved rewards. MURIM allocates incentives based on client contribution, latency, and reputation, supported by a reliability verification module. Extensive experiments on MNIST, FMNIST, and ADULT Income datasets demonstrate that MURIM achieves up to 18% improvement in fairness metrics, reduces privacy attack success rates by 5-9%, and improves robustness against poisoning and noisy-gradient attacks by up to 85% compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Overall, MURIM effectively mitigates adversarial threats, promotes fair and truthful participation, and preserves stable model convergence across heterogeneous and dynamic federated settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant breakthroughs in automated mathematical reasoning and scientific discovery. Georgiev, G${ó}$mez-Serrano, Tao, and Wagner [GGSTW+25] demonstrate that AI systems can explore new constructions and improve existing bounds, illustrating the growing potential of LLMs to accelerate mathematical discovery. Similarly, Bubeck et al. [BCE+25] show that GPT-5 can meaningfully contribute to scientific workflows, from proposing hypotheses to generating proofs and analyses. Despite these advances, a rigorous evaluation of these models on canonical, graduate-level mathematical theory remains necessary to understand their baseline reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of four frontier models: GPT-5-Thinking, Gemini-3-Pro, Claude-Sonnet-4.5-Thinking, and Grok-4 against the classic curriculum of Randomized Algorithms by Motwani and Raghavan [MR95].
  We tasked each model with generating formal LaTeX proofs for a series of lemmas and exercises spanning the textbook. We find that while the top-tier models (Gemini, and Claude) achieve a high accuracy rate (approx. 66%), demonstrating a robust grasp of probabilistic method and formal logic, other models lag significantly in consistency (approx. 40%). We provide a qualitative analysis of the generated proofs, highlighting differences in conciseness, hallucination rates, and logical structure. Our results suggest that while frontier models have reached a threshold of proficiency suitable for graduate-level pedagogical assistance and formalization, significant variance exists in their reliability for rigorous mathematical derivation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ReflCtrl框架，通过表示工程方法分析LLM的自省机制，提取了一个控制自省行为的潜在方向向量，从而能够步进式调控自省频率，减少推理成本的同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然链式思维推理模型的自省能力提升了推理性能，但同时也增加了推理成本。本研究旨在通过分析自省机制的内在表示，找到一种既能保存性能又能降低计算开销的方法。

Method: 1）将模型推理过程分步处理；2）识别自省对应的步骤；3）在潜在空间中提取控制自省行为的"自省方向"；4）基于此提出ReflCtrl步进调控方法控制自省频率。

Result: 实验表明：1）在许多情况下自省是冗余的，尤其是在更强模型中（实验中可节省高达33.6%的推理token同时保持性能）；2）模型的自省行为与其内部不确定性信号高度相关，暗示自省可能由不确定性控制。

Conclusion: 通过表示工程方法可以有效地控制大型语言模型的自省行为，在保持性能的同时显著减少推理成本，这为优化推理效率提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, including mathematics, coding, and general reasoning. A distinctive ability of these reasoning models is self-reflection: the ability to review and revise previous reasoning steps. While self-reflection enhances reasoning performance, it also increases inference cost. In this work, we study self-reflection through the lens of representation engineering. We segment the model's reasoning into steps, identify the steps corresponding to reflection, and extract a reflection direction in the latent space that governs this behavior. Using this direction, we propose a stepwise steering method that can control reflection frequency. We call our framework ReflCtrl. Our experiments show that (1) in many cases reflections are redundant, especially in stronger models (in our experiments, we can save up to 33.6 percent of reasoning tokens while preserving performance), and (2) the model's reflection behavior is highly correlated with an internal uncertainty signal, implying self-reflection may be controlled by the model's uncertainty.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures effectively scale model capacity by activating only a subset of experts for each input token. However, the standard Top-k routing strategy imposes a uniform sparsity pattern that ignores the varying difficulty of tokens. While Top-p routing offers a flexible alternative, existing implementations typically rely on a fixed global probability threshold, which results in uncontrolled computational costs and sensitivity to hyperparameter selection. In this paper, we propose DTop-p MoE, a sparsity-controllable dynamic Top-p routing mechanism. To resolve the challenge of optimizing a non-differentiable threshold, we utilize a Proportional-Integral (PI) Controller that dynamically adjusts the probability threshold to align the running activated-expert sparsity with a specified target. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic routing normalization mechanism that adapts layer-wise routing logits, allowing different layers to learn distinct expert-selection patterns while utilizing a global probability threshold. Extensive experiments on Large Language Models and Diffusion Transformers demonstrate that DTop-p consistently outperforms both Top-k and fixed-threshold Top-p baselines. Our analysis confirms that DTop-p maintains precise control over the number of activated experts while adaptively allocating resources across different tokens and layers. Furthermore, DTop-p exhibits strong scaling properties with respect to expert granularity, expert capacity, model size, and dataset size, offering a robust framework for large-scale MoE pre-training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities and have shown great potential in code generation. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is predicated on the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. However, a critical dichotomy persists: while models are rigorously benchmarked, the data fueling them remains a black box--characterized by opaque composition, uncertain provenance, and a lack of systematic evaluation. This opacity hinders reproducibility and obscures the causal link between data characteristics and model behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenDataArena (ODA), a holistic and open platform designed to benchmark the intrinsic value of post-training data. ODA establishes a comprehensive ecosystem comprising four key pillars: (i) a unified training-evaluation pipeline that ensures fair, open comparisons across diverse models (e.g., Llama, Qwen) and domains; (ii) a multi-dimensional scoring framework that profiles data quality along tens of distinct axes; (iii) an interactive data lineage explorer to visualize dataset genealogy and dissect component sources; and (iv) a fully open-source toolkit for training, evaluation, and scoring to foster data research. Extensive experiments on ODA--covering over 120 training datasets across multiple domains on 22 benchmarks, validated by more than 600 training runs and 40 million processed data points--reveal non-trivial insights. Our analysis uncovers the inherent trade-offs between data complexity and task performance, identifies redundancy in popular benchmarks through lineage tracing, and maps the genealogical relationships across datasets. We release all results, tools, and configurations to democratize access to high-quality data evaluation. Rather than merely expanding a leaderboard, ODA envisions a shift from trial-and-error data curation to a principled science of Data-Centric AI, paving the way for rigorous studies on data mixing laws and the strategic composition of foundation models.

Conclusion: RADAR通过动态决策草稿模型调用，有效减少冗余计算，显著提升了LLM推理速度。

Abstract: Inference with modern Large Language Models (LLMs) is expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has emerged as an effective solution to this problem, however, the number of the calls to the draft model for generating candidate tokens in speculative sampling is a preset hyperparameter, lacking flexibility. To generate and utilize the candidate tokens more effectively, we propose RADAR, a novel speculative sampling method with RL-based dynamic draft trees. RADAR formulates the draft tree generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employs offline reinforcement learning to train a prediction model, which enables real-time decision on the calls to the draft model, reducing redundant computations and further accelerating inference. Evaluations across three LLMs and four tasks show that RADAR achieves a speedup of 3.17x-4.82x over the auto-regressive decoding baseline.

Abstract: Georeferencing text documents has typically relied on either gazetteer-based methods to assign geographic coordinates to place names, or on language modelling approaches that associate textual terms with geographic locations. However, many location descriptions specify positions relatively with spatial relationships, making geocoding based solely on place names or geo-indicative words inaccurate. This issue frequently arises in biological specimen collection records, where locations are often described through narratives rather than coordinates if they pre-date GPS. Accurate georeferencing is vital for biodiversity studies, yet the process remains labour-intensive, leading to a demand for automated georeferencing solutions. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to georeference complex locality descriptions automatically, focusing on the biodiversity collections domain. We first identified effective prompting patterns, then fine-tuned an LLM using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on biodiversity datasets from multiple regions and languages. Our approach outperforms existing baselines with an average, across datasets, of 65% of records within a 10 km radius, for a fixed amount of training data. The best results (New York state) were 85% within 10km and 67% within 1km. The selected LLM performs well for lengthy, complex descriptions, highlighting its potential for georeferencing intricate locality descriptions.

Method: 采用多智能体架构协调自动形式化、证明生成、定理分解和递归证明等过程，扩展Kimina Lean Server以支持AST解析实现自动化递归证明分解

Conclusion: 该方法通过语言模型结合递归分解显著改进了自动定理证明能力，系统已开源并提供PyPI包便于使用和扩展

Abstract: Formal, automated theorem proving has long been viewed as a challenge to artificial intelligence. We introduce here a new approach to computer theorem proving, one that employs specialized language models for Lean4 proof generation combined with recursive decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions. These models are coordinated through a multi-agent architecture that orchestrates autoformalization (if required), proof generation, decomposition of difficult theorems into simpler entailing propositions, and recursive proof (and/or decomposition) of these propositions. Without decomposition, we achieve a 90.4% pass rate on miniF2F. With decomposition, this is significantly improved. A key technical contribution lies in our extension of the Kimina Lean Server with abstract syntax tree (AST) parsing capabilities to facilitate automated, recursive proof decomposition. The system is made available on PyPI as goedels-poetry (at https://pypi.org/project/goedels-poetry ), and the open-source implementation KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry (at https://github.com/KellyJDavis/goedels-poetry ) facilitates both adaptation to alternative language models and extension with custom functionality.

Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the engineering of a Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring and alerting ontology through four key methodologies: One Shot (OS) prompt techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, X-HCOME, and SimX-HCOME+. The primary objective is to determine whether LLMs alone can create comprehensive ontologies and, if not, whether human-LLM collaboration can achieve this goal. Consequently, the paper assesses the effectiveness of LLMs in automated ontology development and the enhancement achieved through human-LLM collaboration.
  Initial ontology generation was performed using One Shot (OS) and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompts, demonstrating the capability of LLMs to autonomously construct ontologies for PD monitoring and alerting. However, these outputs were not comprehensive and required substantial human refinement to enhance their completeness and accuracy.
  X-HCOME, a hybrid ontology engineering approach that combines human expertise with LLM capabilities, showed significant improvements in ontology comprehensiveness. This methodology resulted in ontologies that are very similar to those constructed by experts.
  Further experimentation with SimX-HCOME+, another hybrid methodology emphasizing continuous human supervision and iterative refinement, highlighted the importance of ongoing human involvement. This approach led to the creation of more comprehensive and accurate ontologies.
  Overall, the paper underscores the potential of human-LLM collaboration in advancing ontology engineering, particularly in complex domains like PD. The results suggest promising directions for future research, including the development of specialized GPT models for ontology construction.

Conclusion: MeG方法有效解决了大规模知识编辑的挑战，在保持编辑质量的同时实现了成本效益，为LLM知识更新提供了新思路

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) is a field that studies how to modify some knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) at a low cost (compared to pre-training). Currently, performing large-scale edits on LLMs while ensuring the Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics of the edits remain a challenge. This paper proposes a Massive editing approach for LLMs based on dynamic weight Generation (MeG). Our MeG involves attaching a dynamic weight neuron to specific layers of the LLMs and using a diffusion model to conditionally generate the weights of this neuron based on the input query required for the knowledge. This allows the use of adding a single dynamic weight neuron to achieve the goal of large-scale knowledge editing. Experiments show that our MeG can significantly improve the performance of large-scale KE in terms of Reliability, Generality, and Locality metrics compared to existing knowledge editing methods, particularly with a high percentage point increase in the absolute value index for the Locality metric, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed method.

Abstract: Vehicle Dispatching Systems (VDSs) are critical to the operational efficiency of Automated Container Terminals (ACTs). However, their widespread commercialization is hindered due to their low transferability across diverse terminals. This transferability challenge stems from three limitations: high reliance on port operational specialists, a high demand for terminal-specific data, and time-consuming manual deployment processes. Leveraging the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper proposes PortAgent, an LLM-driven vehicle dispatching agent that fully automates the VDS transferring workflow. It bears three features: (1) no need for port operations specialists; (2) low need of data; and (3) fast deployment. Specifically, specialist dependency is eliminated by the Virtual Expert Team (VET). The VET collaborates with four virtual experts, including a Knowledge Retriever, Modeler, Coder, and Debugger, to emulate a human expert team for the VDS transferring workflow. These experts specialize in the domain of terminal VDS via a few-shot example learning approach. Through this approach, the experts are able to learn VDS-domain knowledge from a few VDS examples. These examples are retrieved via a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, mitigating the high demand for terminal-specific data. Furthermore, an automatic VDS design workflow is established among these experts to avoid extra manual interventions. In this workflow, a self-correction loop inspired by the LLM Reflexion framework is created

Abstract: To address the steep learning curve and reliance on complex manual file editing and command-line operations in the traditional workflow of the mainstream open-source seismic wave simulation software SPECFEM, this paper proposes an intelligent, interactive workflow powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce the first Model Context Protocol (MCP) server suite for SPECFEM (supporting 2D, 3D Cartesian, and 3D Globe versions), which decomposes the entire simulation process into discrete, agent-executable tools spanning from parameter generation and mesh partitioning to solver execution and visualization. This approach enables a paradigm shift from file-driven to intent-driven conversational interactions. The framework supports both fully automated execution and human-in-the-loop collaboration, allowing researchers to guide simulation strategies in real time and retain scientific decision-making authority while significantly reducing tedious low-level operations. Validated through multiple case studies, the workflow operates seamlessly in both autonomous and interactive modes, yielding high-fidelity results consistent with standard baselines. As the first application of MCP technology to computational seismology, this study significantly lowers the entry barrier, enhances reproducibility, and offers a promising avenue for advancing computational geophysics toward AI-assisted and automated scientific research.

Conclusion: Context-Picker通过推理感知的最小充分子集选择方法，有效解决了长文本问答中的上下文量选择难题，为高效准确的问答系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: In long-context question answering (LCQA), determining the optimal amount of context for a given query is a significant challenge. Including too few passages may omit critical information, while including too many can introduce noise and reduce the quality of the answer. Traditional approaches, such as fixed Top-$K$ retrieval and single-stage reranking, face the dilemma of selecting the right number of passages. This problem is particularly pronounced for factoid questions, which often require only a few specific pieces of evidence. To address this issue, we introduce \emph{Context-Picker}, a reasoning-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from similarity-based ranking to minimal sufficient subset selection. Context-Picker treats context selection as a decision-making process optimized via a human-inspired, two-stage reinforcement learning schedule: a \emph{recall-oriented} stage that prioritizes the coverage of reasoning chains, followed by a \emph{precision-oriented} stage that aggressively prunes redundancy to distill a compact evidence set. To resolve reward sparsity, we propose an offline evidence distillation pipeline that mines "minimal sufficient sets" via a Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure, providing dense, task-aligned supervision. Experiments on five long-context and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that Context-Picker significantly outperforms strong RAG baselines, achieving superior answer accuracy with comparable or reduced context lengths. Ablation studies indicate that the coarse-to-fine optimization schedule, the redundancy-aware reward shaping, and the rationale-guided format all contribute substantially to these gains.

Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂多步骤规划任务中表现不佳，经常违反约束且解决方案不一致，现有方法如Chain-of-Thought和ReAct缺乏明确的问题表示，这启发研究者从经典AI规划中寻找解决方案。

Method: 开发了Model-First Reasoning（MFR）两阶段方法：首先LLM构建明确的问题模型，定义实体、状态变量、动作和约束；然后基于该模型生成解决方案计划。

Result: 在医疗调度、路线规划、资源分配、逻辑谜题和程序合成等多个规划领域中，MFR相比Chain-of-Thought和ReAct显著减少了约束违反并提高了解决方案质量。消融研究显示明确的建模阶段对这些改进至关重要。

Conclusion: 许多LLM规划失败源于表示缺陷而非推理限制，明确的建模是构建鲁棒且可解释AI智能体的关键组件。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex multi-step planning tasks, showing high rates of constraint violations and inconsistent solutions. Existing strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and ReAct rely on implicit state tracking and lack an explicit problem representation. Inspired by classical AI planning, we propose Model-First Reasoning (MFR), a two-phase paradigm in which the LLM first constructs an explicit model of the problem, defining entities, state variables, actions, and constraints, before generating a solution plan. Across multiple planning domains, including medical scheduling, route planning, resource allocation, logic puzzles, and procedural synthesis, MFR reduces constraint violations and improves solution quality compared to Chain-of-Thought and ReAct. Ablation studies show that the explicit modeling phase is critical for these gains. Our results suggest that many LLM planning failures stem from representational deficiencies rather than reasoning limitations, highlighting explicit modeling as a key component for robust and interpretable AI agents. All prompts, evaluation procedures, and task datasets are documented to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in optimizers for training, most research works use common scheduler choices like Cosine or exponential decay. In this paper, we study \emph{GreedyLR}, a novel scheduler that adaptively adjusts the learning rate during training based on the current loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduler, we conduct experiments on several NLP, CV, and LLM tasks with up to $7B$ parameters, including both fine-tuning and pre-training experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art schedulers in terms of accuracy, speed, and convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the GreedyLR algorithm, including a proof of convergence and derivation of the optimal scaling factor $F$ that maximizes the convergence rate, along with experiments to show robustness of the algorithm to realistic noisy landscapes. Our scheduler is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and could be considered a good default scheduler for training.

In this work, we systematically analyze UTs variants and show that improvements on ARC-AGI primarily arise from the recurrent inductive bias and strong nonlinear components of Transformer, rather than from elaborate architectural designs. Motivated by this finding, we propose the Universal Reasoning Model (URM), which enhances the UT with short convolution and truncated backpropagation. Our approach substantially improves reasoning performance, achieving state-of-the-art 53.8% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 1 and 16.0% pass@1 on ARC-AGI 2. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/zitian-gao/URM.

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. To study this, we introduce a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) benchmark of 1,000+ heterogeneous games that exhibit significant visual domain gaps. Existing approaches, including VLMs and world models, struggle to capture underlying physics and causality since they are not focused on core mechanisms and overfit to visual details. VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on levels from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning, and even surpasses GPT-5 overall. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning. Further demos and project details can be found at https://mybearyzhang.github.io/ipr-1.

Abstract: As digital health solutions continue to reshape healthcare delivery, telehealth software applications have become vital for improving accessibility, continuity of care, and patient outcomes. This paper presents an analysis of designing a software application focused on Enhanced Telehealth Capabilities (ETHC) for palliative care, integrating across three socio-technical dimensions: quality, human values, and real-world. Designing for quality attributes -- such as performance, maintainability, safety, and security -- ensured that the system is technically robust and compliant with clinical standards. Designing for human values -- empathy, inclusivity, accessibility, and transparency -- helped enhance patient experience, trust, and ethical alignment. Designing for real-world -- through a multidisciplinary, experience-based co-design approach involving clinicians, patients, and carers that guided iterative cycles of prototyping, usability testing, and real-world evaluation -- ensured continuous refinement of features and alignment with clinical practice. The resulting telehealth software solution demonstrated that our socio-technical design framework was successful in producing a secure, equitable, and resilient digital health application. Our design approach can assist others designing software in health and other domains.

TL;DR: 本研究通过实车实验证明，驾驶员可以通过DI训练课程改变跟驰策略，从默认的保持距离模式转变为保持惯性模式，从而显著减少加减速和速度波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的跟驰模型假设驾驶员默认采用保持安全距离的策略，但以往研究表明驾驶员可能存在其他策略如保持惯性。本研究旨在通过实车实验验证驾驶员能否通过训练课程有效采用DI策略。

Method: 邀请12名驾驶员在封闭赛道上跟随前导车（前导车变速行驶），驾驶员先接受基线测试，然后参加DI训练课程，最后再次进行相同场景的实车跟驰测试。同时在模拟器中进行对照实验。

Result: 训练前，驾驶员默认采用保持距离模式，在实地和模拟环境中结果相似。参加完整DI课程后，驾驶员在实地和模拟环境中都表现出显著更少的加减速和速度变异，表明成功采用了DI策略。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实赛道上证明采用DI策略的潜力，驾驶员可以通过专门训练改变跟驰行为，从保持距离转变为保持惯性策略。

Abstract: For decades, car following and traffic flow models have assumed that drivers default driving strategy is to maintain a safe distance. Several previous studies have questioned whether the Driving to Keep Distance is a traffic invariant. Therefore, the acceleration deceleration torque asymmetry of drivers must necessarily determine the observed patterns of traffic oscillations. Those studies indicate that drivers can adopt alternative CF strategies, such as Driving to Keep Inertia, by following basic instructions. The present work extends the evidence from previous research by showing the effectiveness of a DI course that immediately translates into practice on a closed circuit. Twelve drivers were invited to follow a lead car that varied its speed on a real circuit. Then, the driver took a DI course and returned to the same real car following scenario. Drivers generally adopted DD as the default CF mode in the pretest, both in field and simulated PC conditions, yielding very similar results. After taking the full DI course, drivers showed significantly less acceleration, deceleration, and speed variability than did the pretest, both in the field and in the simulated conditions, which indicates that drivers adopted the DI strategy. This study is the first to show the potential of adopting a DI strategy in a real circuit.

Abstract: Juiciness is visual pizzazz used to improve player experience and engagement in games. Most research has focused on juicy particle effects. However, text effects are also commonly used in games, albeit not always juiced up. One type is onomatopoeia, a well-defined element of human language that has been translated to visual media, such as comic books and games. Another is semantic text, often used to provide performance feedback in games. In this work, we explored the relationship between juiciness and text effects, aiming to replicate juicy user experiences with text-based juice and combining particle and text juice. We show in a multi-phase within-subjects experiment that users rate juicy text effects similarly to particles effects, with comparable performance, and more reliable feedback. We also hint at potential improvement in user experience when both are combined, and how text stimuli may be perceived differently than other visual ones. We contribute empirical findings on the juicy-text connection in the context of visual effects for interactive media.

Result: 用户研究发现，LAPPI成功获取用户偏好并生成优于传统和提示工程方法的可行方案。

Conclusion: LAPPI将LLM与优化求解器结合，提升了用户友好的问题定义和解决能力。

Abstract: Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning or meal planning, can be formulated as combinatorial optimization problems. However, using optimization solvers is difficult for end users because it requires problem instantiation: defining candidate items, assigning preference scores, and specifying constraints. We introduce LAPPI (LLM-Assisted Preference-based Problem Instantiation), an interactive approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to support users in this instantiation process. Through natural language conversations, the system helps users transform vague preferences into well-defined optimization problems. These instantiated problems are then passed to existing optimization solvers to generate solutions. In a user study on trip planning, our method successfully captured user preferences and generated feasible plans that outperformed both conventional and prompt-engineering approaches. We further demonstrate LAPPI's versatility by adapting it to an additional use case.

TL;DR: 本文开发并验证了专门评估用户对AI生成健康建议的信任与不信任量表（TAIGHA）及其简短版（TAIGHA-S）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能工具（如大语言模型）越来越多地被公众用于获取健康信息和指导，但在健康相关情境中，接受或拒绝AI建议具有直接的临床意义。现有工具（如自动系统信任量表）评估的是通用技术信任度，缺乏专门针对AI生成健康建议的验证工具。

Method: 采用理论基础构建量表，使用生成式AI方法开发初始项目，经过10名领域专家的内容验证、30名普通参与者的表面验证，以及对385名英国参与者的心理测量验证（让他们在症状评估场景中接收AI建议）。通过自动化项目缩减，从28项减少到10项。

Result: TAIGHA显示出优异的内容效度（S-CVI/Ave=0.99），验证性因子分析证实了双因素模型的良好拟合（CFI=0.98，TLI=0.98，RMSEA=0.07，SRMR=0.03）。量表具有高内部一致性（α=0.95），与自动系统信任量表的收敛效度良好（r=0.67/-0.66），与AI建议依赖度相关（r=0.37），而与阅读流畅度和心理负荷的区分效度低（|r|<0.25）。简短版TAIGHA-S与完整量表高度相关（r=0.96），信度良好（α=0.88）。

Conclusion: TAIGHA和TAIGHA-S是经过验证的评估工具，可分别测量用户对AI生成健康建议的信任与不信任（各包含认知和情感成分）。单独报告信任和不信任可以更完整地评估AI干预效果，简短量表特别适合时间受限的环境。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence tools such as large language models are increasingly used by the public to obtain health information and guidance. In health-related contexts, following or rejecting AI-generated advice can have direct clinical implications. Existing instruments like the Trust in Automated Systems Survey assess trustworthiness of generic technology, and no validated instrument measures users' trust in AI-generated health advice specifically. This study developed and validated the Trust in AI-Generated Health Advice (TAIGHA) scale and its four-item short form (TAIGHA-S) as theory-based instruments measuring trust and distrust, each with cognitive and affective components. The items were developed using a generative AI approach, followed by content validation with 10 domain experts, face validation with 30 lay participants, and psychometric validation with 385 UK participants who received AI-generated advice in a symptom-assessment scenario. After automated item reduction, 28 items were retained and reduced to 10 based on expert ratings. TAIGHA showed excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave=0.99) and CFA confirmed a two-factor model with excellent fit (CFI=0.98, TLI=0.98, RMSEA=0.07, SRMR=0.03). Internal consistency was high (α=0.95). Convergent validity was supported by correlations with the Trust in Automated Systems Survey (r=0.67/-0.66) and users' reliance on the AI's advice (r=0.37 for trust), while divergent validity was supported by low correlations with reading flow and mental load (all |r|<0.25). TAIGHA-S correlated highly with the full scale (r=0.96) and showed good reliability (α=0.88). TAIGHA and TAIGHA-S are validated instruments for assessing user trust and distrust in AI-generated health advice. Reporting trust and distrust separately permits a more complete evaluation of AI interventions, and the short scale is well-suited for time-constrained settings.

Abstract: The real-time deployment of cascaded generative AI pipelines for applications like video translation is constrained by significant system-level challenges. These include the cumulative latency of sequential model inference and the quadratic ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) computational complexity that renders multi-user video conferencing applications unscalable. This paper proposes and evaluates a practical system-level framework designed to mitigate these critical bottlenecks. The proposed architecture incorporates a turn-taking mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user scenarios, and a segmented processing protocol to manage inference latency for a perceptually real-time experience. We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($τ< 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience. The work presents a validated, end-to-end system design that offers a practical roadmap for deploying scalable, real-time generative AI applications in multilingual communication platforms.

Abstract: The primary challenge of video streaming is to balance high video quality with smooth playback. Traditional codecs are well tuned for this trade-off, yet their inability to use context means they must encode the entire video data and transmit it to the client. This paper introduces ELVIS (End-to-end Learning-based VIdeo Streaming Enhancement Pipeline), an end-to-end architecture that combines server-side encoding optimizations with client-side generative in-painting to remove and reconstruct redundant video data. Its modular design allows ELVIS to integrate different codecs, inpainting models, and quality metrics, making it adaptable to future innovations. Our results show that current technologies achieve improvements of up to 11 VMAF points over baseline benchmarks, though challenges remain for real-time applications due to computational demands. ELVIS represents a foundational step toward incorporating generative AI into video streaming pipelines, enabling higher quality experiences without increased bandwidth requirements.

Abstract: Heat pump systems are critical components in modern energy-efficient buildings, yet their operational stress detection remains challenging due to complex thermodynamic interactions and limited real-world data. This paper presents a novel Physics-Guided Deep Neural Network (PG-DNN) approach for heat pump stress classification using the When2Heat dataset, containing 131,483 samples with 656 features across 26 European countries. The methodology integrates physics-guided feature selection and class definition with a deep neural network architecture featuring 5 hidden layers and dual regularization strategies. The model achieves 78.1\% test accuracy and 78.5% validation accuracy, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches: +5.0% over shallow networks, +4.0% over limited feature sets, and +2.0% over single regularization strategies. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of physics-guided feature selection, variable thresholding for realistic class distribution, and cross-country energy pattern analysis. The proposed system provides a production-ready solution for heat pump stress detection with 181,348 parameters and 720 seconds training time on AMD Ryzen 9 7950X with RTX 4080 hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当针对数学推理等专门任务微调大型语言模型时，模型会出现灾难性遗忘，丧失之前学到的通用能力。研究人员希望探索如何实现专业化而不牺牲通用能力。

Method: 在Flan-T5-Base模型上进行实验，先进行数学专用训练，然后提出混合训练策略——在训练中间插数学和NLI（自然语言推理）样本。系统性地探索了从1:1到15:1的不同混合比例。

Result: 纯数学训练将数学准确率从3.1%提升到12.0%，但导致NLI准确率从81.0%崩溃到16.5%（下降64.5个百分点）。混合训练（1:1比例）保持了12.0%的数学准确率，同时保持了86.2%的NLI准确率。即使最小程度的NLI暴露（6.2%）也能提供有效的正则化效果。

Conclusion: 专业化训练不一定需要遗忘通用能力。混合训练可以完全消除灾难性遗忘，同时保持等效的专业任务性能。这对于扩展到更大模型具有重要启示，混合训练可能在遗忘预防之外带来额外的好处。

Abstract: When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\% to 12.0\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\% to 16.5\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.

Abstract: The interaction structure of a complex dynamical system governs its collective behavior, yet existing reconstruction methods struggle with nonlinear, heterogeneous, and higher-order couplings, especially when only steady states are observable. We propose a Variational Physics-Informed Ansatz (VPIA) that infers general interaction operators directly from heterogeneous steady-state data. VPIA embeds the steady-state constraints of the dynamics into a differentiable variational representation and reconstructs the underlying couplings by minimizing a physics-derived steady-state residual, without requiring temporal trajectories, derivative estimation, or supervision. Residual sampling combined with natural-gradient optimization enables scalable learning of large and higher-order networks. Across diverse nonlinear systems, VPIA accurately recovers directed, weighted, and multi-body structures under substantial noise, providing a unified and robust framework for physics-constrained inference of complex interaction networks in settings where only snapshot observations are available.

Motivation: 洪水是全球最具破坏性的自然灾害之一，对生态系统、基础设施和人类生计构成严重威胁。研究旨在开发结合SAR数据与机器学习的方法，在数据有限地区进行准确的洪水易发性制图，为灾害风险管理提供支持。

Method: 使用Sentinel-1双极化SAR数据获取2024年5月洪水事件的二值化洪水清单作为训练数据，结合六个条件因子(坡度、高程、坡向、土地利用/覆盖、土壤类型、与河流距离)，采用四种监督分类器(LR、CART、SVM、RF)建立洪水易发性模型，并通过准确性、Kappa系数和ROC分析评估性能。

Result: 随机森林模型(RF)在所有模型中表现最佳，准确率达到0.762，Kappa系数为0.480。基于RF的易发性图显示维多利亚湖附近低洼的Kano平原洪水脆弱性最高，这与历史洪水记录和2024年5月洪水事件的影响相一致。

Abstract: Flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, posing serious risks to ecosystems, infrastructure, and human livelihoods. This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习遗忘旨在从不完整重新训练中移除特定训练数据的影响。虽然LLMs的遗忘已有进展，但文档分类模型的遗忘研究相对不足。为此，我们研究文档分类器的类别级遗忘问题。

Method: Hessian Reassignment：两阶段模型无关方法。1）类影响计算：解决Hessian-向量系统，通过共轭梯度法进行单次影响式更新，仅需梯度和Hessian-向量乘积，减去目标类别所有训练点的贡献；2）决策空间保证：采用Top-1分类策略，避免基础方法中常见的删除类别样本随机重分类问题。

Result: 在标准文本基准测试中，Hessian Reassignment保持的类别准确率接近完整重训练（不含目标类别）的水平，且运行速度快数个数量级。同时，通过池化多影子攻击测量，该方法能持续降低删除类别的成员推断优势。

Conclusion: Hessian Reassignment为文档分类中的高效类别遗忘提供了一条实用且原则性的路径，实现了遗忘效果与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the influence of specific training data from a model without full retraining. While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks. These results demonstrate a practical, principled path to efficient class unlearning in document classification.

Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of hospitalization among young children, with outbreaks strongly influenced by environmental conditions. This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \textit{Low risk}, \textit{Alert}, and \textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段联邦少样本学习框架，用于解决脑电图癫痫检测中数据分散、隐私保护和个性化需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中脑电图数据稀缺、分散在不同机构，且受严格隐私法规限制，无法集中数据训练AI模型进行癫痫检测。

Method: 第一阶段：使用联邦学习对预训练的生物信号变换器进行微调，在模拟医院站点间共享表示学习；第二阶段：通过联邦少样本个性化，仅用5个标记脑电片段为每个患者自适应分类器。

Result: 联邦微调阶段平衡准确率0.43（集中式为0.52），Cohen's kappa 0.42（0.49），加权F1 0.69（0.74）；个性化阶段平均平衡准确率0.77，Cohen's kappa 0.62，加权F1 0.73。

Conclusion: FFSL框架能在现实数据可用性和隐私限制下支持有效的个性化癫痫检测，为临床实践提供可行的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Many deep learning approaches have been developed for EEG-based seizure detection; however, most rely on access to large centralized annotated datasets. In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限时间预算约束下的推荐系统优化问题，提出了基于强化学习的时隙推荐方法，通过平衡物品相关性和评估成本来提高用户参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推荐任务没有考虑用户有限的时间预算这一关键资源约束，在移动购物等场景中，用户需要花费时间评估推荐物品的特性，高相关但高评估成本的物品可能无法适应用户的时间限制，从而影响用户参与度。

Method: 1. 将时间约束的时隙推荐统一建模为具有预算感知效用的马尔可夫决策过程 2. 开发了一个在重排序数据上研究策略行为的仿真框架 3. 使用强化学习算法同时学习用户偏好和时间预算模式

Result: 实验表明，在严格的时间预算约束下，基于策略和离策略的强化学习方法相比传统的上下文赌博机方法能够提高推荐性能。

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能够有效优化时间约束下的推荐系统，通过同时考虑物品相关性和评估成本，在有限的用户时间预算内最大化用户参与度，在实际电商场景中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Unlike traditional recommendation tasks, finite user time budgets introduce a critical resource constraint, requiring the recommender system to balance item relevance and evaluation cost. For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文针对网约车平台的匹配优化问题，提出了一种基于强化学习的时空自适应延迟匹配框架RAST-MoE，通过专家混合架构提升表示能力，在真实数据上显著降低了匹配和接客延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网约车平台需要在高度不确定的供需条件下平衡乘客等待时间和系统效率。传统的自适应延迟匹配方法或过度简化交通动态，或使用浅层编码器而忽略了复杂的时空模式，因此需要更先进的解决方案。

Method: 提出了Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE)框架，将自适应延迟匹配形式化为一个感知动态模式（regime-aware）的MDP，并采用自注意力专家混合编码器。专家模块自动专精化，在保持计算效率的同时提升表示能力。此外，还引入了物理信息拥塞替代模型来保持现实的密度-速度反馈，以及自适应奖励机制防止病态策略。

Result: 仅使用1200万个参数，该框架在真实Uber轨迹数据（旧金山）上表现优异：总奖励提升超过13%，平均匹配延迟和接客延迟分别降低10%和15%。该模型在未见的需求模式下也表现出鲁棒性，并且训练稳定。

Conclusion: 研究表明，专家混合增强的强化学习在具有复杂时空动态的大规模决策任务中具有巨大潜力，为网约车平台的匹配优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times with overall system efficiency under highly uncertain supply-demand conditions. Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.
  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.
  With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.

Abstract: Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\times$ less than classical methods.

<details>

Motivation: 当前深度学习和算子学习方法在稀疏观测条件下失败，模型无法处理任意几何的测量点，缺乏鲁棒性和不确定性量化。迫切需要一种能从任意观测集合进行稳定反演的方法。

Method: 提出物理反演求解器PIS：基于集合条件的扩散框架，使用Set Transformer编码器处理任意数量和几何的测量，采用余弦退火稀疏课程学习提升鲁棒性，并结合信息论分析揭示稀疏度极限。

Result: 在Darcy流、Helmholtz波场反演和结构健康监测三个PDE反问题中，即使在0.29%的极端观测率下，PIS仍保持稳定准确，误差降低12.28%-88.73%，能产生校准的后验样本。

Conclusion: PIS是一个强大、通用且具有稀疏鲁棒性的物理反演解决方案，能在任意严重欠采样观测下可靠工作，为解决现实世界中传感器放置受限的问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Estimation of PDE-constrained physical parameters from limited indirect measurements is inherently ill-posed, particularly when observations are sparse, irregular, and constrained by real-world sensor placement. This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\%$--$88.73\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.

Abstract: Approaches for compressing large-language models using low-rank decomposition have made strides, particularly with the introduction of activation and loss-aware SVD, which improves the trade-off between decomposition rank and downstream task performance. Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates. Our fine-tuning-free approach also performs competitively with the fine-tuning variant of LLM-Pruner.

Motivation: 随着云边协同的发展，推荐服务越来越多地在分布式环境中训练。联邦推荐通过共享模型参数而非原始数据来实现多端协同训练并保护隐私。然而，大量嵌入参数（主要源于海量物品嵌入）严重阻碍了通信效率。现有研究主要聚焦于提升联邦推荐模型的效率，却很大程度上忽视了嵌入参数量大的问题。

Abstract: With the rise of cloud-edge collaboration, recommendation services are increasingly trained in distributed environments. Federated Recommendation (FR) enables such multi-end collaborative training while preserving privacy by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, the large number of parameters, primarily due to the massive item embeddings, significantly hampers communication efficiency. While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead. To address this gap, we propose a FR training framework with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) based embedding designed to reduce the volume of embedding parameters that need to be transmitted. Our approach offers a lightweight, plugin-style solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FR methods. In addition to incorporating common PEFT techniques such as LoRA and Hash-based encoding, we explore the use of Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RQ-VAE) as a novel PEFT strategy within our framework. Extensive experiments across various FR model backbones and datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces communication overhead while improving accuracy.

Abstract: Multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD) aims to accurately identify and localize complex abnormal patterns in the large-scale industrial control systems. While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components. Our code and model will be made publicly open soon.

Conclusion: TF-MCL模型通过时频融合和多域对比学习优化，显著提升MDD检测性能，为解决脑电信号标注挑战提供有效方案

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the use of supervised detection methods of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, the challenge of securing them against adversarial "jailbreaking" attacks has intensified. Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy "reflex-based" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models.

Motivation: 金融情感分析有助于理解市场，但标准NLP方法在小数据集上效果不佳，特别是在资源受限环境中。本研究旨在评估在这种约束下，基于嵌入的方法（如Word2Vec、GloVe和句子变换器）的实际表现。

Method: 在手动标注的新闻标题上，结合梯度提升模型，对比评估Word2Vec、GloVe和句子变换器三种预训练嵌入表示。分析中考虑了验证集与测试集的性能差异及小验证集导致的过拟合问题。

Result: 实验结果显示，验证集与测试集性能存在显著差距，模型表现甚至不如简单基线。这表明预训练嵌入在数据量低于一定临界值时，收益递减，小验证集导致模型选择过拟合。

Conclusion: 嵌入质量本身无法解决数据稀缺问题。实践者在资源有限时，当标注样本不足时，应考虑使用少样本学习、数据增强或词典增强的混合方法等替代方案。

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.

Abstract: Scaling large language models (LLMs) demands approaches that increase capacity without incurring excessive parameter growth or inference cost. Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design.

Abstract: Existing traffic volume estimation methods typically address either forecasting traffic on sensor-equipped roads or spatially imputing missing volumes using nearby sensors. While forecasting models generally disregard unmonitored roads by design, spatial imputation methods explicitly address network-wide estimation; yet this approach relies on volume data at inference time, limiting its applicability in sensor-scarce cities. Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive ablation studies that demonstrate the model's capacity to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies and highlight the value of topological information for accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation without relying on volume data at inference time.

Abstract: Safety-critical learning requires policies that improve performance without leaving the safe operating regime. We study constrained policy learning where model parameters must satisfy unknown, rollout-based safety constraints. We propose SCPO, a sampling-based weight-space projection method that enforces safety directly in parameter space without requiring gradient access to the constraint functions. Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup. On regression with harmful supervision and a constrained double-integrator task with malicious expert, our approach consistently rejects unsafe updates, maintains feasibility throughout training, and achieves meaningful primal objective improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.

In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the existence and effect of percolation in training deep Neural Networks (NNs) with dropout. Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics.
  If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.

Abstract: We make two contributions to the problem of estimating the $L_1$ calibration error of a binary classifier from a finite dataset. First, we provide an upper bound for any classifier where the calibration function has bounded variation. Second, we provide a method of modifying any classifier so that its calibration error can be upper bounded efficiently without significantly impacting classifier performance and without any restrictive assumptions. All our results are non-asymptotic and distribution-free. We conclude by providing advice on how to measure calibration error in practice. Our methods yield practical procedures that can be run on real-world datasets with modest overhead.

Abstract: Infant cry classification can aid early assessment of infant needs. However, deployment of such solutions is limited by privacy concerns around audio data, sensitivity to background noise, and domain shift across recording environments. We present an end-to-end infant cry analysis pipeline that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained using communication-efficient federated learning (FL). The system performs on-device denoising, adaptive segmentation, post hoc calibration, and energy-based out-of-distribution (OOD) abstention. Federated training employs a regularized control variate update with 8-bit adapter deltas under secure aggregation. Using the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets with ESC-50 noise overlays, the model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, an AUC of 0.962, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.032, while reducing per-round client upload from approximately 36 to 42 MB to 3.3 MB. Real-time edge inference on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4 GB, TensorRT FP16) achieves 96 ms per one-second spectrogram frame. These results demonstrate a practical path toward privacy-preserving, noise-robust, and communication-efficient infant cry classification suitable for federated deployment.

Conclusion: OPTIMA为一击后训练剪枝设定了新的准确性-效率折中最先进标准，在单加速器上实现规模化剪枝而不需要微调

Abstract: Post-training model pruning is a promising solution, yet it faces a trade-off: simple heuristics that zero weights are fast but degrade accuracy, while principled joint optimization methods recover accuracy but are computationally infeasible at modern scale. One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.

Abstract: Progress on training and architecture strategies has enabled LLMs with millions of tokens in context length. However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.

Abstract: Forecasting meteorological variables is challenging due to the complexity of their processes, requiring advanced models for accuracy. Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers.

Abstract: Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.

Abstract: Multi-hybrid architectures are poised to take over language modeling due to better quality and performance. We introduce a hierarchical decomposition framework for linear recurrences that allows us to develop algorithms aligned with GPU memory hierarchies, yielding Sliding Window Recurrences. We focus specifically on truncating recurrences to hardware-aligned windows which are naturally jagged, limiting costly inter-warp communication. Using SWR, we develop Phalanx layers that serve as drop-in replacements for windowed attention or linear recurrences. In 1B parameter multi-hybrid models, Phalanx achieves over 10-40% speedup across 4K to 32K context length over optimized Transformers while matching perplexity.

Abstract: Spherical equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) provide a principled framework for learning on three-dimensional molecular and biomolecular systems, where predictions must respect the rotational symmetries inherent in physics. These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges regarding computational resources and memory capacity. Although distributed training techniques help mitigate these issues, they still suffer from considerable communication overhead. Existing approaches primarily rely on static gradient compression to enhance communication efficiency; however, these methods neglect the dynamic nature of evolving gradients during training, leading to performance degradation. Accelerating LLM training via compression without sacrificing performance remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose an entropy-driven dynamic gradient compression framework called EDGC. The core concept is to adjust the compression rate during LLM training based on the evolving trends of gradient entropy, taking into account both compression efficiency and error. EDGC consists of three key components.First, it employs a down-sampling method to efficiently estimate gradient entropy, reducing computation overhead. Second, it establishes a theoretical model linking compression rate with gradient entropy, enabling more informed compression decisions. Lastly, a window-based adjustment mechanism dynamically adapts the compression rate across pipeline stages, improving communication efficiency and maintaining model performance. We implemented EDGC on a 32-NVIDIA-V100 cluster and a 64-NVIDIA-H100 cluster to train GPT2-2.5B and GPT2-12.1B, respectively. The results show that EDGC significantly reduces communication latency and training time by up to 46.45% and 16.13% while preserving LLM accuracy.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a key methodology for accelerating molecular discovery by estimating the mapping from molecules to their properties while seeking the optimal candidate. Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.

Abstract: In-context learning is fundamental to modern Large Language Models (LLMs); however, prevailing architectures impose a rigid and fixed contextual structure by assigning linear or constant positional indices. Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promise in forecasting future data from multivariate time series. However, few existing methods account for recurring structures, or patterns, that appear within the data. We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty. We apply our method to two well-motivated forecasting applications, predicting visual field measurements and motion capture frames. On both, we show that pattern guidance improves PGDM's performance (MAE / CRPS) by up to 40.67% / 56.26% and 14.12% / 14.10%, respectively. PGDM also outperforms baselines by up to 65.58% / 84.83% and 93.64% / 92.55%.

Abstract: Antigenic epitope presented by major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) proteins plays an essential role in immunotherapy. However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.

Abstract: Cancer progression arises from interactions across multiple biological layers, especially beyond morphological and across molecular layers that remain invisible to image-only models. To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting. These results highlight the value of biologically informed multimodal design and underscore the potential of integrated genotype-to-phenotype modeling for next-generation precision oncology.

Abstract: Time series analysis plays a vital role in fields such as finance, healthcare, industry, and meteorology, underpinning key tasks including classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

Motivation: 现代MoE模型趋向于更高的专家粒度（较小的专家中间维度）和更高的稀疏性（激活专家数恒定但总专家数增加），这虽然提高了每FLOP的模型质量，但也带来了激活内存占用增加、硬件效率降低以及Grouped GEMM内核中的填充浪费计算等问题。

Method: 提出了一种内存高效算法，在最小化反向传播激活缓存的情况下计算MoE的前向和反向传播；设计了能够重叠内存IO与计算的GPU内核；并提出了一种新颖的“token rounding”方法，以减少Grouped GEMM内核中填充造成的计算浪费。

Result: SonicMoE将激活内存减少了45%，在Hopper GPU上相比ScatterMoE的BF16 MoE内核实现了1.86倍的计算吞吐量提升。在64个H100上，训练吞吐量达到每天2130亿token，与ScatterMoE在96个H100上训练的2250亿token/天相当。在高稀疏性设置下，tile-aware token rounding算法相比原始top-K路由在保持下游性能的同时，带来了额外的1.16倍内核执行加速。

Conclusion: SonicMoE通过减少内存占用和优化计算效率，显著提升了MoE模型的训练性能，为高效训练大规模MoE模型提供了实用解决方案，相关内核已开源。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as the de facto architecture for scaling up language models without significantly increasing the computational cost. Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel "token rounding" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.

Abstract: We present approximation theories and efficient training methods for derivative-informed Fourier neural operators (DIFNOs) with applications to PDE-constrained optimization. A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fréchet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning. Numerical examples on nonlinear diffusion--reaction, Helmholtz, and Navier--Stokes equations demonstrate that DIFNOs are superior in sample complexity for operator learning and solving infinite-dimensional PDE-constrained inverse problems, achieving high accuracy at low training sample sizes.

Abstract: As modern neural networks become increasingly memory-bound, inference throughput is limited by DRAM bandwidth rather than compute. We present Arithmetic-Intensity-Aware Quantization (AIQ), a mixed precision quantization framework that chooses per-layer bit-widths to maximize arithmetic intensity (AI) while minimizing accuracy loss. AIQ is a post-training quantization method that uses search algorithms over per-layer quantization schemes to minimize a weighted loss over AI and accuracy. On ResNet-20/CIFAR-10, AIQ increases AI by ~50% over an FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within ~1 percentage point, and outperforming global uniform quantization schemes. On a memory-bound MobileNetV2 architecture, AIQ configurations give a 1.66x higher throughput than the FP32 baseline while keeping test accuracy within 1 percentage point. We also find that AIQ naturally quantizes larger layers more aggressively.

Abstract: We present Cornserve, an efficient online serving system for an emerging class of multimodal models called Any-to-Any models. Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.
  Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.
  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.
  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChunjinJiang/sgrpo.

Conclusion: PathFinder通过主动环境建模和创新架构设计，有效解决了无线路径损耗预测中的关键挑战，特别是在单发射器到多发射器场景的泛化能力方面取得了突破

Abstract: Radio path loss prediction (RPP) is critical for optimizing 5G networks and enabling IoT, smart city, and similar applications. However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training). Experimental results show PathFinder outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly, especially in challenging multi-transmitter scenarios.

Abstract: This paper motivates the use of random-bridges -- stochastic processes conditioned to take target distributions at fixed timepoints -- in the realm of generative modelling. Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores. Our analysis provides evidence that the proposed framework is computationally cheap and suitable for high-speed generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.

Abstract: The success of modern multimodal representation learning relies on internet-scale datasets. Due to the low quality of a large fraction of raw web data, data curation has become a critical step in the training pipeline. Filtering using a trained model (i.e., teacher-based filtering) has emerged as a successful solution, leveraging a pre-trained model to compute quality scores. To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $η\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\frac{1}{η\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning reaction-diffusion (RD) systems from data while ensuring physical consistency and well-posedness of the learned models. Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.

Abstract: Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce FLAME, a family of extremely lightweight and capable Time Series Foundation Models, which support both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting via generative probabilistic modeling, thus ensuring both efficiency and robustness. FLAME utilizes the Legendre Memory for strong generalization capabilities. Through adapting variants of Legendre Memory, i.e., translated Legendre (LegT) and scaled Legendre (LegS), in the Encoding and Decoding phases, FLAME can effectively capture the inherent inductive bias within data and make efficient long-range inferences. To enhance the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting while keeping efficient, FLAME adopts a Normalization Flow based forecasting head, which can model the arbitrarily intricate distributions over the forecasting horizon in a generative manner. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of FLAME on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Current Preferential Bayesian Optimization methods rely on Gaussian Processes (GPs) as surrogate models. These models are hard to interpret, struggle with handling categorical data, and are computationally complex, limiting their real-world usability. In this paper, we introduce an inherently interpretable decision tree-based surrogate model capable of handling both categorical and continuous data, and scalable to large datasets. Extensive numerical experiments on eight increasingly spiky optimization functions show that our model outperforms GP-based alternatives on spiky functions and has only marginally lower performance for non-spiky functions. Moreover, we apply our model to the real-world Sushi dataset and show its ability to learn an individual's sushi preferences. Finally, we show some initial work on using historical preference data to speed up the optimization process for new unseen users.

Abstract: Many learning problems involve symmetries, and while invariance can be built into neural architectures, it can also emerge implicitly when training on group-structured data. We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) promises significant computational advantages, yet models trained on sensitive data risk memorizing individual records, creating serious privacy vulnerabilities. While Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) mechanisms provide theoretical worst-case guarantees, they critically lack empirical verification tools for deployed models. We introduce the first black-box privacy auditing framework for QML based on Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, leveraging quantum canaries (strategically offset-encoded quantum states) to detect memorization and precisely quantify privacy leakage during training. Our framework establishes a rigorous mathematical connection between canary offset and trace distance bounds, deriving empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption that bridge the critical gap between theoretical guarantees and practical privacy verification. Comprehensive evaluations across both simulated and physical quantum hardware demonstrate our framework's effectiveness in measuring actual privacy loss in QML models, enabling robust privacy verification in QML systems.

Abstract: Machine-learning surrogate models have shown promise in accelerating aerodynamic design, yet progress toward generalizable predictors for three-dimensional wings has been limited by the scarcity and restricted diversity of existing datasets. Here, we present SuperWing, a comprehensive open dataset of transonic swept-wing aerodynamics comprising 4,239 parameterized wing geometries and 28,856 Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow field solutions. The wing shapes in the dataset are generated using a simplified yet expressive geometry parameterization that incorporates spanwise variations in airfoil shape, twist, and dihedral, allowing for an enhanced diversity without relying on perturbations of a baseline wing. All shapes are simulated under a broad range of Mach numbers and angles of attack covering the typical flight envelope. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we benchmark two state-of-the-art Transformers that accurately predict surface flow and achieve a 2.5 drag-count error on held-out samples. Models pretrained on SuperWing further exhibit strong zero-shot generalization to complex benchmark wings such as DLR-F6 and NASA CRM, underscoring the dataset's diversity and potential for practical usage.

Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.

TL;DR: ClimaX-LETKF是首个完全数据驱动的机器学习集成天气预报系统，能稳定运行多年，通过同化NCEP ADP观测数据，发现MLWP模型相比传统NWP模型恢复大气场吸引子的能力较弱，RTPP方法比RTPS更稳定精确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器学习天气预报（MLWP）取得重大进展，但在MLWP模型中同化实际观测或集合预报的研究仍然有限，需要构建独立于数值天气预报（NWP）模型的纯数据驱动ML集成系统。

Method: 开发了ClimaX-LETKF系统，基于局部集合转换卡尔曼滤波器（LETKF），通过同化NCEP ADP全球高空和地面天气观测数据运行，比较了松弛先验扰动（RTPP）和松弛先验扩展（RTPS）两种同化方法的效果。

Result: 实验表明纯数据驱动ML集成系统能多年稳定运行，RTPP方法比RTPS在MLWP中表现更稳定精确（而NWP模型通常RTPS更稳定），MLWP模型恢复大气场吸引子的能力比NWP模型弱。

Conclusion: 这项工作为增强MLWP集成预报系统提供了宝贵见解，代表了其实用化应用的重要一步，发现了MLWP与NWP在同化方法响应上的关键差异。

Abstract: While machine learning-based weather prediction (MLWP) has achieved significant advancements, research on assimilating real observations or ensemble forecasts within MLWP models remains limited. We introduce ClimaX-LETKF, the first purely data-driven ML-based ensemble weather forecasting system. It operates stably over multiple years, independently of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, by assimilating the NCEP ADP Global Upper Air and Surface Weather Observations. The system demonstrates greater stability and accuracy with relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) than with relaxation to prior spread (RTPS), while NWP models tend to be more stable with RTPS. RTPP replaces an analysis perturbation with a weighted blend of analysis and background perturbations, whereas RTPS simply rescales the analysis perturbation. Our experiments reveal that MLWP models are less capable of restoring the atmospheric field to its attractor than NWP models. This work provides valuable insights for enhancing MLWP ensemble forecasting systems and represents a substantial step toward their practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate chemical kinetics modeling is essential for combustion simulations, as it governs the evolution of complex reaction pathways and thermochemical states. In this work, we introduce Kinetic-Mamba, a Mamba-based neural operator framework that integrates the expressive power of neural operators with the efficient temporal modeling capabilities of Mamba architectures. The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets. Computational experiments on Syngas and GRI-Mech 3.0 reaction mechanisms demonstrate that our framework achieves high fidelity in predicting complex kinetic behavior using only the initial conditions of the state variables.

Abstract: Monitoring data transfer performance is a crucial task in scientific computing networks. By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了两种变分自编码器(VAE)模型来生成合成多通道心房电活动图(EGM)，以解决心电成像数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 房颤是最常见的持续性心律失常，但其临床评估需要准确的心房电活动表征。虽然非侵入性心电成像与深度学习结合的方法在从体表电位估计心内心电图方面显示出潜力，但受限的配对数据可用性阻碍了进展。

Method: 提出两种变分自编码器模型：特定于窦性心律的VAE-S模型和基于类别条件的VAE-C模型（同时在窦性心律和房颤信号上训练）。使用形态、频谱和分布相似性指标评估生成的EGM。

Result: VAE-S在模拟EGM上实现更高的保真度，而VAE-C能够实现节律特异性生成，但以降低窦性心律重建质量为代价。作为概念验证，生成的EGM被用于下游非侵入性EGM重建任务中的数据增强，中等程度的增强改善了估计性能。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明基于VAE的生成模型有潜力缓解数据稀缺问题，并增强基于深度学习的心电成像流程。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations are increasingly proposed as interpretable mechanisms to achieve algorithmic recourse. However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable and efficient predictive tools that support early intervention. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: The convergence behavior of classical iterative solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) is often highly sensitive to the domain and specific discretization of PDEs. Previously, we introduced hybrid solvers by combining the classical solvers with neural operators for a specific geometry 1, but they tend to under-perform in geometries not encountered during training. To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the Overlap-Weighted Hierarchical Normalized Persistence Velocity (OW-HNPV), a novel topological data analysis method for detecting anomalies in time-varying networks. Unlike existing methods that measure cumulative topological presence, we introduce the first velocity-based perspective on persistence diagrams, measuring the rate at which features appear and disappear, automatically downweighting noise through overlap-based weighting. We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons. Our results show that modeling topological velocity is crucial for detecting structural anomalies in dynamic networks.

Abstract: Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy. The supplementary material, including code and appendix, can be found in https://github.com/chaohaoyuan/ParaFormer.

Abstract: We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$Δ$ are provided.

Abstract: Hospitals lack automated systems to harness the growing volume of heterogeneous clinical and operational data to effectively forecast critical events. Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.
