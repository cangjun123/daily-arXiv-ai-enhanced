### [1] [Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究设计了一种系统，通过分析腹腔镜手术视频来辅助识别和标注子宫内膜异位症的暗色植入物，提高视频浏览和诊断效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子宫内膜异位症在女性中很常见，其在身体内部的多种外观和位置使识别变得困难，尤其是对于非专业的医疗从业者。因此，该研究旨在为治疗子宫内膜异位症的妇科医生提供辅助技术。

Method: 该研究训练了一个系统，用于识别和分割腹腔镜手术视频中的暗色子宫内膜植入物，通过对这些视频进行分析，系统能够为识别的植入物区域添加多色覆盖层并显示检测摘要。

Result: 系统能够识别和分析手术视频中的暗色子宫内膜植入物，并以多色覆盖层标注出这些区域，便于医生浏览和检测。

Conclusion: 该系统能够有效分析腹腔镜手术视频，标注识别的内膜植入物区域，并提供检测摘要以改善视频浏览。

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [2] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文将传统视觉模型与VLM结合，显著提高了遥感图像分析中的检测和理解能力，特别是在少样本学习场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型需要大量特定领域的标记数据，且在理解复杂环境的上下文方面能力有限，而遥感应用中对此有更高需求。

Method: 研究结合了YOLO与VLMs如LLaVA、ChatGPT和Gemini，以提高遥感图像的解释能力，并在标记和未标记数据及退化图像场景中评估了其性能。

Result: 该方法在飞机检测和计数准确性方面，尤其是在挑战性条件下，平均绝对误差（MAE）提高了48.46%。在全面理解遥感图像方面，CLIPScore提高了6.17%。

Conclusion: 将传统视觉模型与视觉语言模型（VLMs）结合可以显著提升遥感图像分析的准确性和上下文理解能力，特别是在飞机检测和场景理解任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究开发并验证了一个AI系统，用于检测前列腺癌的筛状形态。模型在内部和外部验证中展示了强劲的性能，与病理学家的结果一致，潜在地提升了诊断的可靠性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前列腺癌中的筛状形态是一种预示不良预后的组织学特征，并不建议进行积极监测。然而，它仍然被漏报，并且病理学家之间的观察者间变异性显著。我们旨在开发和验证一个基于AI的系统，以改进筛状模式检测。

Method: 我们使用EfficientNetV2-S编码器和多实例学习创建了一个深度学习模型，用于端到端的整体切片分类。模型在来自430名患者的640个数字化前列腺针刺活检样本上进行了训练，来自三个不同的群体。内部通过171名患者的261个切片验证，外部通过完全独立于开发集设备和实验室的三组独立群体的266个切片验证。标注由三位已知高一致性的专家泌尿病理学家提供。并进行评分者间分析，将模型性能与九名专家泌尿病理学家在内部验证队列的88个切片上的表现进行比较。

Result: 该模型在内部验证中的表现强劲（AUC：0.97，95% CI: 0.95-0.99；Cohen's kappa：0.81，95% CI：0.72-0.89），在外部验证中表现稳健（AUC：0.90，95% CI: 0.86-0.93；Cohen's kappa：0.55，95% CI：0.45-0.64）。在评分者间分析中，模型达到了最高的平均一致性（Cohen's kappa：0.66，95% CI: 0.57-0.74），超过了九位病理学家，其Cohen's kappa在0.35到0.62之间。

Conclusion: 我们的AI模型在检测前列腺癌的筛状形态方面表现出与病理学家相当的能力。这种方法可能提高诊断可靠性，标准化报告，并改善前列腺癌患者的治疗决策。

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [4] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure方法增强了模型对抗非加性图像扰动的能力，显著提高了分类模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然对抗净化在对抗图像扰动中取得了成功，但现有方法对非加性扰动如模糊、遮挡和失真效果欠佳。

Method: 在生成对抗图像的过程中，通过似然最大化将底层的干净图像和扰动参数分离出来，从而实现非加性扰动的净化。

Result: 实验表明，NAPPure在GTSRB和CIFAR-10数据集上能有效提高模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NAPPure显著增强了图像分类模型对非加性扰动的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [5] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent框架通过图结构化检索与推理，优化了长视频语言模型的性能，在多个基准上显著超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频中需要高效处理大量视频令牌并保留长期序列信息，而传统的RAG方法在长视频中应用时面临时间相关性中断和包含不相关信息等问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于图的检索推理增强生成框架Vgent，其中视频被表示为保留跨视频剪辑语义关系的结构化图，以改善检索效果，并通过结构化验证减少检索噪声，明确聚合跨剪辑的相关信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，在三个长视频理解基准上，相较于基础模型和现有视频RAG方法，Vgent框架整体性能提升了3.0%至5.4%，并在MLVU基准上超越了现有的最先进视频RAG方法8.6%。

Conclusion: Vgent框架在长视频理解方面的表现优于基础模型和现有的视频RAG方法，提供了更准确和具有上下文意识的响应。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [6] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出时间原型学习（TPL）框架，通过构建共享的一维表示实现复杂视频场景同步。结果表明该方法提高了同步精准度和鲁棒性，并适用于生成AI视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频同步尤其是不同场景或生成式AI视频的同步由于主体、背景等因素错综复杂而困难。本文旨在通过时间原型学习框架构建共享的一维表示，解决复杂的视频同步问题。

Method: 本文提出了时间原型学习（TPL）框架，通过使用原型构建共享的一维表示，从高维嵌入中提取特征，以实现视频同步。该方法不依赖于详尽的成对匹配，而是通过学习统一的原型序列来锚定关键动作阶段，从而实现视频的鲁棒对齐。

Result: 实验表明，TPL在多个数据集上提高了同步的准确性、效率和鲁棒性，同时还支持细粒度的帧检索和阶段分类任务。此外，TPL是首个能够减轻多生成AI视频的同步问题的方法。

Conclusion: 时间原型学习（TPL）是一种有效的视频同步方法，能够在具有挑战性的场景中实现准确而高效的对齐，对于生成AI视频的同步提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种创新性的零样本流程，通过少量无结构照片创建高度逼真、身份保留效果良好的3D头像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临几个挑战：单视图方法存在几何不一致和幻觉问题，导致身份保留效果下降；而在合成数据上训练的模型未能捕获如皮肤皱纹和细小头发等高频细节，限制了现实感。

Method: 该方法引入了两个关键贡献：（1）生成规范化模块，该模块将多个无结构视图处理为一致的标准化表示；（2）基于一种新的大规模高保真高斯喷溅头像数据集训练的变压器模型，该数据集来源于对真实人类的穹顶捕捉。

Result: 该方法的"捕获、规范化、喷溅"流程能够从无结构照片中生成静态的四分之一身体头像，确保了诱人的现实感和稳健的身份保留。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的零样本流程，通过少量的无结构手机照片创建超逼真且保留身份的3D头像。

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

TL;DR: cubic是一个开源Python库，通过GPU加速增强SciPy和scikit-image，支持2D和3D生物图像分析，提升了效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代显微镜生成的2D和3D数据集越来越大，现有计算方法在可扩展性、效率和与现代科学计算工作流程的集成方面受到限制。

Method: cubic通过增强SciPy和scikit-image API并结合CuPy和RAPIDS cuCIM的GPU加速替代方案来解决这些挑战，提供设备无关性API，当数据位于设备上时将操作分派到GPU，否则在CPU上执行。

Result: 通过对个别操作进行基准测试以及重现现有的解卷积和分割管道，cubic在实现显著加速的同时保持算法的忠实度。

Conclusion: cubic提供了一个强大的基础，用于可扩展性、再现性的生物图像分析，并且可以集成到更广泛的Python科学计算生态系统中。

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了联合Big Five和HEXACO的人格特征建模方法，实验验证了其可以有效识别多模态下的人类显性人格特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管以往大多数研究都使用Big Five进行多模态显性人格特质识别，但尚无研究关注于可以评估与替代性攻击和报复等相关的诚实-谦卑特质的显性HEXACO。而且，尚未明确Big Five和HEXACO在机器学习建模时的关系。

Method: 本文提出了一种联合建模方法，将Big Five和HEXACO结合，用于从多模态人类行为自动识别显性人格特质。实验使用了自我介绍的视频数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明，考虑Big Five和HEXACO之间的关系可以提高对多模态人类行为的认知，并优化其联合识别。

Conclusion: 通过实验表明，所提出的方法可以有效识别Big Five和HEXACO的人格特质。

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

TL;DR: 比特平面图像处理和最大梯度贴片选择提升AI图像检测准确率至98.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN和Diffusion模型的快速发展，识别AI生成图像与真实图像变得更加困难，现有方法的高计算成本和未能捕获图像中固有的噪声特征的问题亟需解决。

Method: 该研究利用比特平面图像处理和最大梯度贴片选择以提取噪声特征，并设计了轻量级分类头以实现高效的AI生成图像检测。

Result: 该方法在GenImage基准测试中平均准确率达98.9%，从GAN到Diffusion的准确率超过98.2%，从Diffusion到GAN超过99.2%，并且比现有方法快近百倍。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种创新性的方法通过比特平面引导的噪声图像生成和多种图像归一化策略，有效提升了AI生成图像检测的准确性和速度。实验表明，该方法在GenImage基准测试中表现出色，具有很好的跨生成器泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

### [12] [PIA: Deepfake Detection Using Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14241)
*Soumyya Kanti Datta,Tanvi Ranga,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new framework, PIA, that leverages multimodal analysis to detect deepfakes more effectively, addressing the shortcomings of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve detection of deepfakes generated by advanced models, which traditional methods fail to detect due to temporal discrepancies that go unnoticed.

Method: The paper introduces Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis (PIA), a multimodal framework using language cues, dynamic face motion, and facial identification to detect deepfakes.

Result: The proposed PIA method improves the detection accuracy of modern deepfakes by leveraging inconsistencies in audio-visual modalities.

Conclusion: PIA framework significantly enhances deepfake detection capabilities, particularly for subtle manipulations that previous methods might overlook.

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有的图像到视频生成模型难以在视频生成过程中保持人脸身份的一致性，这对于人脸只占据图像小部分时尤为明显。因此，研究提出了一种新的优化框架，旨在解决这一关键且未被充分研究的挑战。

Method: 本研究提出的IPRO方法在不引入辅助模块或更改模型架构的情况下，利用面部身份评分者优化扩散模型，通过在采样链的最后步骤反向传播奖励信号来改善性能并加速收敛。此外，还提出了一种新的面部评分机制，并结合KL散度正则化以稳定训练。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种名为IPRO的身份保留奖励引导优化的新视频扩散框架，通过强化学习提高了身份保留能力，并在广泛实验中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 这个研究提出了Identity-GRPO，一种提升多人人物身份一致性的视频生成方法，并实现了显著的效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在处理动态交互中的多人人物身份一致性时存在困难，需要一种新的方法来解决此问题。

Method: 提出了一种人类反馈驱动的优化流程（Identity-GRPO），构建了一个视频奖励模型，并应用了一个专门为多人人物身份一致性设计的GRPO变体。

Result: Identity-GRPO在人物身份一致性指标上比基线方法提升了最多18.9%。

Conclusion: Identity-GRPO有效提升了视频生成的多人人物身份一致性问题，为个性化视频生成与强化学习对齐提供了可实施的见解。

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

*Tingman Yan,Tao Liu,Xilian Yang,Qunfei Zhao,Zeyang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的注意力机制MatchAttention和解码器MatchDecoder，有效解决了高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配，取得了多项数据集的最佳成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跨注意力机制在处理高分辨率图像时存在平方复杂度和缺乏明确匹配约束的问题，因此需要一种新的注意力机制来提高高分辨率图像的匹配精度和效率。

Method: 提出了一种新的注意力机制MatchAttention，通过动态匹配相对位置来优化高分辨率图像的跨视图匹配。另外，设计了高效的分层跨视图解码器MatchDecoder，并通过门控的跨MatchAttention和一致性约束损失来处理跨视图遮挡问题。

Result: 在多项公开数据集上取得了领先的成绩，例如Middlebury、KITTI 2012、KITTI 2015、ETH3D和Spring flow，MatchStereo-B在Middlebury基准测试中排名第一，KITTI分辨率推断仅需29ms，而MatchStereo-T可以在0.1秒内处理4K UHD图像，且仅需3GB GPU内存。

Conclusion: 提出的MatchAttention机制和MatchDecoder能够有效处理高分辨率图像的匹配问题，实现了实时、高精度的跨视图匹配，取得了多项基准测试的领先成绩。

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart enhances 3D scene reconstruction by integrating 2D models with 3D Gaussian Splatting, outperforming existing methods in preserving details and realism in sparse data areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of Gaussian Splatting in capturing fine details and maintaining realism in scenes with sparse data coverage. This is achieved by combining 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction techniques to improve performance.

Method: The method involves integrating 2D computer vision techniques, such as convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from 2D models like DINO, with 3D Gaussian Splatting. This integration uses 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings to guide and refine the densification of Gaussian splats in scene reconstruction.

Result: GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian splatting methods in scene reconstruction, providing better structural detail preservation and coverage in underrepresented regions.

Conclusion: GauSSmart, a hybrid method that integrates 2D foundational models with 3D Gaussian Splatting, improves scene reconstruction. It outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting by enhancing the capture of intricate details and realism in areas with sparse data coverage.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在多模态任务上虽然表现出色，但仍会出现幻象现象，即过度依赖单一模态或记忆训练数据而导致输出未被合理支持。

Method: 提出了一种无训练的三层对比解码方法，并结合水印机制。具体步骤包括：选择解码层中的成熟层和非成熟层，利用与水印相关的问题来识别枢轴层，通过三层对比解码生成最终输出。

Result: 在公共基准如POPE, MME和AMBER上的实验显示，该方法在减少大视觉语言模型的幻象现象中达到了最新水平。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效减少LVLMs的幻象现象，并生成更具视觉依据的回应。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MID-StyleGAN generates high-quality synthetic ocular images to improve iris PAD systems, increasing effectiveness and addressing data shortages in biometrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris presentation attack detection (PAD) techniques, due to the difficulties in constructing and imaging presentation attacks (PAs).

Method: The paper introduces the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN (MID-StyleGAN), which combines diffusion models and GANs. It employs a multi-domain architecture for translating bonafide ocular images to various PA domains and uses an adaptive loss function to maintain domain consistency.

Result: MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating synthetic ocular images. The synthetic data improves the true detect rate in PAD systems on datasets like LivDet2020 from 93.41% to 98.72% at a 1% false detect rate.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN significantly enhances the performance of PAD systems by providing high-quality, diverse synthetic ocular images, addressing the data scarcity problem in iris biometrics.

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

TL;DR: VaCo improves MLLMs by integrating vision-centric information and resolving representation conflicts, enhancing visual comprehension performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitation of mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which are primarily supervised by textual token prediction and often neglect crucial vision-centric information necessary for analytical capabilities.

Method: VaCo employs Vision-Centric activation and Coordination mechanisms, incorporating learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) to activate specific visual signals. It also utilizes a Token Gateway Mask (TGM) to manage information flow, thereby resolving representation conflicts across multiple VFMs.

Result: Through extensive experimentation, VaCo has been shown to significantly enhance the visual comprehension performance of various multimodal large language models on a range of benchmarks.

Conclusion: VaCo has proven to significantly enhance the performance of various MLLMs on diverse benchmarks, especially in visual comprehension tasks. It achieves this by optimizing MLLM representations through the integration of visual discriminative alignment and task-aware perceptual features from multiple VFMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

*Han Qiu,Peng Gao,Lewei Lu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR approach enhances MLLMs' fine-grained spatial perception by rewarding precise localization, improving alignment with visual input effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack fine-grained spatial perception abilities and often fail to meet user requirements for detailed spatial understanding. This is due to a focus on pre-annotated instruction data without direct supervision of MLLMs’ responses.

Method: The method involves the Spatial Preference Rewarding (SPR) approach, which rewards MLLMs for precise object localization and evaluates MLLM-generated descriptions using semantic and localization scores. It refines descriptions for better localization accuracy and pairs them with initial low-scored descriptions for preference optimization.

Result: SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities, as demonstrated by extensive experiments on standard referring and grounding benchmarks.

Conclusion: SPR approach enhances MLLMs' spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal training overhead, improving fine-grained alignment with visual input.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

Method: 提出了一种名为DOS（Directional Object Separation）的方法，该方法通过在将文本嵌入传递给文本到图像模型之前，修改三种类型的CLIP文本嵌入来解决问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，DOS方法在多物体图像生成方面表现良好，显著减少了物体混合的发生率。

Conclusion: DOS显著提高了多物体图像生成的成功率，并减少了物体混合的问题。人类评估显示DOS在四个基准上表现优于四种竞争方法，得票率高出26.24%-43.04%。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤的准确分割对于临床诊断和治疗至关重要。然而，由于肿瘤不同区域的异质性，这项任务充满挑战。现有的Mamba-based State Space Models虽然表现优异，但由于需要在多个空间轴上进行连续特征计算，导致计算开销过大。此外，这些模型在不同的BraTS数据分区上的鲁棒性尚未被充分探索，留下了一个可靠评估的关键空白。

Method: 本文提出了双分辨率双向Mamba模型（DRBD-Mamba），通过空间填充曲线保留空间局部性，减少依赖计算成本高的多轴特征扫描，并通过门控融合模块和量化模块丰富特征表示。此外，本文设计了针对BraTS2023的五个系统折叠以在多种条件下对分割技术进行严格评估，并详细分析了常见的失败场景。

Result: 在近期方法使用的20%测试集中，我们的模型在整体肿瘤上实现了0.10%的Dice改进，在肿瘤核心方面提升了1.75%，在增强肿瘤上提升了0.93%。在我们提出的系统五折评估上，我们的模型在保持竞争性整体肿瘤准确率的同时，在肿瘤核心和增强肿瘤上分别实现了0.86%和1.45%的平均Dice增益。此外，我们的模型在效率上提升了15倍，同时保持了高分割准确性，突出了其相对现有方法的鲁棒性和计算优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出的DRBD-Mamba模型在脑肿瘤分割方面表现出色，在保持高准确率的同时显著提高了计算效率，是对现有基于Mamba的状态空间模型的一项重要改进。这项研究通过提出创新的特征整合和量化模块，有效地解决了当前方法的计算开销问题，并在多种条件下进行了严格评估，验证了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic

*Chao Tu,Kun Huang,Jie Zhang,Qianjin Feng,Yu Zhang,Zhenyuan Ning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DCMIL模型，通过有效处理全片幅图像，为癌症预后提供了更准确的预测，并在多种癌症类型上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在处理全片幅图像时常常忽略了多倍镜的细粒度信息和肿瘤微环境的变化，同时面临着计算瓶颈和密集人工注释稀缺的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为DCMIL的渐进表示学习模型，通过双课程对比多实例学习的方法，能够有效处理用于癌症预后的全片幅图像。

Result: DCMIL不仅在实验中表现优异（在12种癌症类型的5954名患者中进行测试），还能识别细粒度的预后显著区域，提供强大的实例不确定性估计，捕捉正常组织和肿瘤组织之间的形态差异，具有产生新的生物学见解的潜力。

Conclusion: DCMIL模型在不依赖于密集注释的情况下，可以直接将全片幅图像（WSIs）转化为癌症预后预测，并且在多种癌症类型上表现优于标准的WSI预后模型。

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合帧内/帧间编码技术，提出了一种改进的NVC方案，能更好地处理视频中新增和遮挡内容，减少误差传播并提高压缩效能，实验结果显示出优于现有方案的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有NVC方案在处理遮挡和新内容方面的低效以及帧间误差传播和积累等问题。

Method: 以单一模型进行帧内/帧间自适应编码，并设计了同时进行两帧压缩的结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方案在BD率方面比DCVC-RT平均减少10.7%，并保证了每帧的比特率和质量稳定以及实时编码/解码性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一的NVC框架，通过自适应的帧内/帧间编码显著提高了视频压缩效率，同时减少了误差传播和累计的问题。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the vulnerability of deep learning-based video object detectors to adversarial attacks, especially those involving universal perturbations.

Method: The paper employs nuclear norm regularization to create structured perturbations that concentrate in the background, using an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method for optimization to enhance scalability and convergence.

Result: The proposed attack outperforms other methods like low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in terms of effectiveness and stealthiness.

Conclusion: The proposed minimally distorted universal adversarial attack is effective and maintains high stealthiness against video object detectors.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

TL;DR: 研究利用卫星时序数据和CNN-LSTM模型有效检测季节性放牧，对未放牧地进行优先检查可显著提高检查效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放牧对农业生产和生物多样性有重要影响，但对放牧地点的大规模监测仍然有限。

Method: 我们使用了一个包括CNN-LSTM模型的集成方法，基于多时相反射特征进行训练，用于哨兵-2 L2A时序数据中的二元预测。

Result: 模型在五个验证集中的平均F1得分为77%，对于放牧草地的召回率达到90%。通过优先检查模型预测为未放牧的田地，可以比随机检查多发现17.2倍的未放牧地点。

Conclusion: 利用粗分辨率、免费卫星数据，可以可靠地指导为保护地使用合规性而进行的检查资源分配。

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,

*Yunze Tong,Didi Zhu,Zijing Hu,Jinluan Yang,Ziyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的噪声投影器，通过文本条件调整初始噪声，提高生成图像与文本提示的对齐效果，且不增加推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本到图像生成中，不同初始噪声导致生成的图像可能无法与提示文本很好对齐，现有方法对此有一定的改善但存在局限。本文认为问题归因于训练和推理阶段的不匹配，即训练时使用的是与提示相关的噪声，而推理时使用提示无关的高斯先验噪声。

Method: 首先采样一些噪声并使用视觉语言模型获取其对应图像的标记级反馈，然后将这些信号提炼成一个奖励模型，最后通过准直接偏好优化来优化噪声投影器。

Result: 通过引入噪声投影器，实验显示在多个不同的提示下，文本与图像的对齐性有显著改善。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种噪声投影器，在不修改预训练模型的情况下，通过文本条件细化初始噪声，改善生成图像与文本提示的对齐。

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI

DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Result: VisualSplit通过显式分解视觉属性，在包括图像生成和编辑等各种高级视觉任务中促进了有效的属性控制，表明这种新学习方法在视觉理解方面的有效性。

Conclusion: VisualSplit通过将图像显式分解为经典描述符，使得在高级视觉任务中的属性控制更加有效，证明了这种新学习方法对视觉理解的有效性。

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

Conclusion: 与现有的一步PEFT方法相比，FMA具备多步调整能力，能够实现更精确和稳健的特征对齐，在各种基准和模型上表现出显著的性能提升，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上。

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法在不同场景中保持相同主体身份的能力不足，存在身份漂移的问题。现有方法通常依赖于预先知道所有目标场景这一不现实的假设。

Method: 提出了一种高效的、无需训练的提示嵌入编辑方法，称为场景去情境化（SDeC），通过量化SVD方向稳定性来自适应重权相关特征值，从而抑制提示嵌入内的场景-身份相关性。

Result: 实验证明，SDeC在增强身份保真性和保持场景多样性方面取得了显著效果。

Conclusion: SDeC显著增强了身份保真性，同时保持了场景多样性，是一种灵活且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Result: 通过在NVIDIA A100 GPU上进行实验，比起传统3DGS方法，BalanceGS实现了1.44倍的训练加速，且质量下降可以忽略不计。

Conclusion: 通过引入BalanceGS，我们在保持质量的同时，实现了1.44倍的训练加速。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

*Matan Rusanovsky,Shimon Malnick,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新框架实现像素级定位，包括描述和定位两个组件，并引入数据集LlamaPointInPart以弥补训练缺陷。结果表明，该方法在定位精度方面优于基线，并能支持未来应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在跨模态理解中取得了显著成功，但它们仍然局限于对象级或区域级定位，缺乏通过自然语言进行像素精确关键点理解的能力。

Method: 我们介绍了一种新颖的像素级定位框架，包括两个互补的组件：Point Descriptor生成关键点的丰富上下文描述，Point Localizer从这些描述中回归精确的像素坐标。我们引入LlamaPointInPart数据集，并通过在AP-10K上优化Point Descriptor进行交叉类别泛化，使用冻结的Point Localizer作为奖励模型，提高定位精度。

Result: 实验表明，与基线模型相比，我们的框架在LlamaPointInPart数据集上表现优异。此外，该框架的双向特性应能支持未来的关键点引导图像理解与语言引导精确定位的应用。

Conclusion: 我们的框架在LlamaPointInPart数据集上表现优于基线模型，并在关键点引导的图像理解和语言引导的精确定位中具备应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

TL;DR: STANCE通过采用实例线索和Dense RoPE来增强视频生成中的运动一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成在视觉效果上取得了令人瞩目的进展，但保持连贯的对象运动和交互仍然困难，该研究旨在解决这个问题。

Method: 本文提出了STANCE，一个将图像转换为视频的框架，采用两个主要组件来解决问题：实例线索与Dense RoPE。

Result: STANCE框架在不需要逐帧轨迹脚本的情况下，通过结合RGB和辅助地图预测，增强了结构的锚定，提高了优化稳定性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: STANCE框架通过引入实例线索和Dense RoPE组件，有效地改进了视频生成中的对象运动和交互的连贯性。

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Motivation: 目前的动物分类模型如SpeciesNet虽然可以针对数千种物种进行预测，但采用保守的汇总策略，导致许多动物被标记在较高的分类级别而非物种。

Method: 提出了一种五阶段的流水线（高置信度接受、鸟类覆盖、质心构建、三元组损失度量学习、自适应余弦距离评分），结合了SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M预测与CLIP嵌入进行再分类。

Result: 在LILA BC 沙漠狮子保护数据集的一部分上进行了评估，重新分类并纠正了一些标签，重新分类精度达到了96.5%，物种级别识别达到了64.9%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种动物检测平台的层次化再分类系统，将SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M预测与CLIP嵌入和度量学习结合，以细化高层次分类标签为物种级别识别，显著提高了准确性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide
predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies,
resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species.
We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect
platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP

TL;DR: 该研究通过组合视觉转换器与无监督聚类和降维技术，实现了无需标签的野生动物图像高效归类与排序，显著提升了生物多样性监测中的人工标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于相机陷阱产生了大量野生动物图像，但其中许多数据集中的物种在现有分类器中是缺失的，该研究旨在开发和评估无监督方法，以在无标签的情况下组织这些图像。

Method: 该研究使用自监督学习的视觉转换器（Vision Transformers），在Animal Detect平台下开发并测试无标签的野生动物图像的组织方法。具体方法包括比较无监督聚类（DBSCAN, GMM）与三种架构（CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor）的结合，并应用降维技术（PCA, UMAP）。还通过t-SNE投影实现连续的1D相似性排序。

Result: 在一个包含五个物种的测试集中，仅使用真实标签进行评估，DINOv2结合UMAP和GMM的方案实现了88.6%的准确率（macro-F1为0.874）；而1D排序对于哺乳动物和鸟类达到了88.2%的连贯性，对于鱼类则达到了95.2%，在1500张图像中表现良好。

Conclusion: 研究成功地在Camera trap图像数据上实现了高效的无监督归类和排序方法，大大加快了生物多样性监测中的人工标注流程。这证明了在没有现有分类器支持的情况下，应用自监督学习和无监督聚类可以取得优异的性能。

Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain
species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates
zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using
self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal

methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor)
combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we
demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a
5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2
with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D
sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent
for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成方法在多模态查询的质量和检索结果的相关性方面存在困难，因此需要一种新方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一种称为Wiki-PRF的三阶段方法，包括处理、检索和过滤阶段。处理阶段动态调用视觉工具来提取精确的多模态信息用于检索。检索阶段整合视觉和文本特征，以实现多模态知识检索。过滤阶段执行相关性过滤并集中于检索结果。引入了一种通过强化学习方式以答案准确性和格式一致性为奖励信号训练的视觉语言模型。

Result: 在E-VQA和InfoSeek基准数据集上的回答质量显著提高，分别达到了36.0和42.8的提升。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，Wiki-PRF方法在E-VQA和InfoSeek基准数据集上的回答质量显著提升，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Shot2Tactic-Caption框架，通过视频字幕生成捕获羽毛球战术执行，实验结果显示其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive understanding of tactical execution in badminton by generating semantic and temporal multi-scale video captions.

Method: Shot2Tactic-Caption framework with a dual-branch design, including a visual encoder, spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and Transformer-based decoder. It also incorporates a Tactic Unit Detector and a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism.

Result: Experimental results showed that the framework is effective in generating captions, and ablation studies highlighted the superior performance of the ResNet50-based encoder and shot-wise prompt structuring.

Conclusion: The proposed Shot2Tactic-Caption framework effectively generates both shot-level and tactic-level captions for badminton videos.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

TL;DR: EVS 方法通过修剪时间静态的补丁，大幅减少视频处理中的标记冗余，提升效率，并保持较高的准确率，适用于长视频的可扩展视频语言理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉-语言模型从静态图像扩展到视频理解，其在处理视频时的标记预算和延迟问题显露出来，尤其是长视频常超出现代语言模型的标记预算，导致上下文限制和延迟。

Method: 提出了一种名为高效视频采样（EVS）的简单插入式方法，用于识别并修剪视频中时间静态的补丁，无需架构变更或重新训练，保持位置识别，减少标记数量。

Result: Efficient Video Sampling (EVS) 能有效减少视频中的标记冗余，同时保持语义保真，确保更快的推理和更长的输入序列。EVS 在推理时大幅减少大语言模型的首次标记时间（TTFT），损失最小的准确性约为4倍。

Conclusion: EVS 方法显著改善了效率与准确性之间的权衡，使得视频语言理解在不牺牲质量的前提下，更加可扩展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Representation Tokenizer (RepTok)生成建模框架，通过单一潜在令牌有效表征图像，解决空间冗余和训练成本问题，并在图像生成任务中取得竞争力结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的生成模型面临的一个主要挑战是如何在保证性能的情况下减少训练成本。许多生成模型使用的潜在空间存在空间冗余，这会导致计算开销的增加。此外，生成模型需要处理图像重建中的低级细节，以实现准确的图像生成。

Method: 引入Representation Tokenizer (RepTok)框架，该框架从自监督视觉变换模型中获得单一连续潜在令牌来表征图像。通过对预训练的自监督学习编码器进行微调，结合生成解码器，采用标准流匹配目标进行联合训练。此外，使用余弦相似度损失来规范化适应的令牌，从而保持潜在空间的流畅性。

Result: RepTok在类条件ImageNet生成任务中取得了具有竞争力的结果，并能自然扩展到文本到图像的合成，在极为有限的训练预算下于MS-COCO数据集上实现了竞争力的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 微调的自监督学习表示可以作为紧凑且有效的潜在空间，以用于高效的生成建模。RepTok框架解决了2D潜在空间的空间冗余问题，显著降低了训练成本，同时保持了生成性能。

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

Motivation: 为了解决由于分布变化导致的深度模型性能下降问题，同时克服现有输入仅依赖渐进指导、限制探索及扭曲类型泛化的问题。

Method: 提出了SteeringTTA，这是一种推理框架，将费曼-卡克引导应用于基于扩散的输入适应，使用伪标签驱动的奖励进行引导。通过维持多个粒子轨迹，并结合累计的前K高概率和熵调度来进行引导，以平衡探索和信心。

Result: SteeringTTA在不进行模型更新或使用源数据的情况下，在ImageNet-C数据集上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SteeringTTA在不需要任何模型更新或源数据的情况下，在ImageNet-C上始终表现优于基线。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于指令的图像编辑发展迅速，但其在视频领域的扩展仍未受到充分探索，主要因为构建大规模配对视频编辑数据集的成本高且复杂。

Method: 通过对基础视频生成模型进行预训练，模型能根据输入的编辑指令执行一般编辑任务（如添加、替换、删除操作），然后利用少量高质量的配对编辑数据进行有效微调。

Result: 比较实验表明，该方法在指令对齐和视觉保真度上优于现有的基于指令的视频编辑方法，实现了编辑指令跟随性提高12%和编辑质量提升15%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种低成本的预训练策略，通过无配对的视频剪辑进行上下文学习，应用于基于指令的视频编辑，从而解决了构建大规模视频编辑数据集的高昂成本和复杂性问题。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Motivation: 传统的MAE预训练计算代价大，在时间和资源有限的工业环境中不切实际。

Method: 在MAE（Masked Autoencoder）预训练中集成DBP（Decorrelated Backpropagation）以加速收敛。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K预训练和ADE20K微调中，DBP-MAE将达到基线性能的时间缩短了21.1%，碳排放量减少了21.4%，并且提高了分割mIoU 1.1点。

Conclusion: DBP可以在不损失稳定性的前提下加速MAE的预训练，使其在实际工业场景中更具实用性。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Motivation: 矿业活动尽管对工业和经济发展至关重要，但仍是环境退化的主要原因，因此需要持续的、长期的监测以进行可持续资源管理和环境治理。

Method: 研究使用Sentinel-2多光谱影像构建EuroMineNet数据集，对欧洲联盟的133个矿区进行观察和专家验证标注，并采用GeoAI方法进行环境动态分析。

Result: 通过对20种最先进的深度学习模型进行基准测试，研究表明GeoAI方法能够有效识别长期环境变化，但在检测短期动态方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: EuroMineNet通过促进时空一致的矿区监测，为可持续土地利用管理和环境弹性做出了贡献，并支持应用GeoAI实现社会和环境的福祉。

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeCKD redefines knowledge distillation using a structured model chain, enhancing learning in limited-data scenarios and outperforming traditional methods across various medical imaging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation frameworks often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and dependence on strong teacher models or large labeled datasets, which limits their practicality in limited-data scenarios.

Method: WeCKD introduces a progressive distillation chain, where each model learns from its predecessor and refines the knowledge before forwarding it, which reduces data dependency and the limitations of one-step knowledge distillation.

Result: WeCKD surpassed the performance of existing supervised methods across multiple otoscopic imaging datasets and demonstrated strong generalization to other medical imaging modalities, achieving up to a 23% improvement in accuracy over conventional approaches.

Conclusion: WeCKD achieves significant accuracy improvements over traditional KD frameworks and is well-suited for limited data scenarios, showing promise for real-world medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

Motivation: 鲸鱼监测对于保护至关重要，但传统调查方法成本高且难以规模化。

Method: 使用统计异常检测方法来标记空间异常点，并与一个网页标注界面配对，使专家可以快速标注有趣的点。

Result: 在三个已知鲸鱼标注的基准场景上，我们的系统实现了90.3%到96.4%的召回率，同时将专家需要检查的区域减少了99.8%。

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

TL;DR: 提议的跨层特征自注意模块（CFSAM）通过改进多尺度特征图的依赖建模，提升了目标检测性能并加速了训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法多局限于细化单层或融合双层特征，忽略了多尺度表示中的丰富跨层依赖关系，限制了捕获具有大规模变化目标的综合上下文信息的能力。

Method: 本文提出了一种新颖的跨层特征自注意模块（CFSAM），通过卷积局部特征提取器、基于Transformer的全局建模单元和特征融合机制，实现对多尺度特征图中局部和全局依赖关系的整体建模。

Result: CFSAM集成到SSD300框架后，显著提升了检测性能，在PASCAL VOC上达到78.6% mAP（对比基线75.5%），在COCO上达到52.1% mAP（对比基线43.1%），且加速训练收敛，无明显计算开销。

Conclusion: 显式跨层注意建模对于提升多尺度目标检测具有重要意义。

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种能够处理真实世界中多粒度标签的层次图像分类方法，并提供相应的基准以验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统层次图像分类方法通常假设标签注释完整且精细，但实际情况往往并非如此，图像质量、标注者专业程度和任务需求等因素影响标签粒度。现实中标注粒度通常不均匀化，例如一张远距离拍摄的鸟类图像可能只被标注为“鸟”，而近距离特写则可能标注为“秃鹰”。

Method: 该研究引入了一个名为ImageNet-F的大规模基准，其从ImageNet中挑选并构建认知启发的基本、下属和精细级别结构。利用CLIP来模拟语义歧义，生成与人类标注行为一致的、具有现实混合粒度的标签。研究提出了自由粒度学习，允许实例间的异构监督。同时发展了通过视觉语言模型的伪属性和半监督学习提供语义和视觉指导的方法。

Result: 研究结果表明，在自然环境下，使用混合监督的情况下，通过提出的方法可以大大提高层次分类性能。

Conclusion: 研究为在受到真实世界多种约束下的层次分类提供了新的基准和方法，显著提升了在混合监督下的分类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为DEXTER的数据无关框架，不需训练数据即可对视觉分类器进行全球文本解释，显示出其卓越的模型解释能力和偏见报告性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和解释机器学习模型的行为对于构建透明和值得信赖的AI系统至关重要，因此研究人员开发了一种新方法，即DEXTER，以提供无需依赖训练数据的模型解释。

Method: 该研究引入了DEXTER，这是一种数据无关的框架，利用扩散模型和大型语言模型生成视觉分类器的全球文本解释。通过优化文本提示合成类条件图像，这些图像能够强烈激活目标分类器，进而引出详细的自然语言报告，描述类特定的决策模式和偏见。

Result: 实验结果表明，DEXTER在不同任务（激活最大化、切片发现与去偏、偏见解释）上的应用展示了它揭示视觉分类器内部机制的能力。而定量和定性评估（包括用户研究）也显示出DEXTER产生了准确且可解释的输出。

Conclusion: DEXTER能够在无需训练数据或真实标签的情况下，为视觉分类器提供全球文本解释，揭示分类器的决策过程和偏见。其研究结果表明，DEXTER在全局模型解释和类级偏见报告方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低光照条件下难以提取可靠的特征表示，因此本研究旨在通过开发LightQANet来在多样化光照条件下实现一致且稳健的图像质量提升。

Method: 论文中提出的LightQANet框架包括两个关键模块：光量化模块（LQM）和光感知提示模块（LAPM）。LQM用于提取与量化图像特征中的光照相关因素，而LAPM通过编码光照先验，引导特征学习以适应复杂的光照变化。

Result: 该论文提出了一种名为LightQANet的新框架，通过引入量化和自适应特征学习来增强低光照图像。在静态建模方面，设计了光量化模块（LQM）用于提取和量化图像特征中的光照相关因素，而动态适应方面，引入了光感知提示模块（LAPM），用于编码光照先验并动态指导特征学习过程。

Conclusion: LightQANet通过引入LQM和LAPM模块，显著改善了低光照条件下的图像增强效果，在多个低光数据集上的实验表明其达到了技术的最前沿。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的火星地形重建主要依赖于简单的插值技术，这些技术常常无法保持地形的几何一致性。提出一种新的方法来解决这个问题。

Method: 基于无条件扩散模型的火星表面重建方法，利用NASA的HiRISE调查中的12000个火星高程图进行训练，并采用非均匀重新缩放策略。

Result: 所提出的方法在重构精度（RMSE提高4-15%）和与原始数据的感知相似性（LPIPS提高29-81%）方面均超越了Inverse Distance Weighting、kriging和Navier-Stokes算法等方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在火星表面重建中在重构精度和感知相似性上优于其他现有的孔洞填充技术。

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL framework introduces structured reasoning and contrastive learning, surpassing previous methods in recognizing unseen object categories in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVD methods heavily rely on direct image-text matching and lack robustness in complex scenes. The motivation is to incorporate intermediate reasoning steps for better scene interpretation.

Method: The paper introduces CoT-PL, a framework that uses structured visual chain-of-thought reasoning and contrastive background learning to enhance pseudo-labeling in OVD.

Result: CoT-PL demonstrates significant improvements in novel-class pseudo-label quality, with gains of 103.4% and 168.4% over previous methods in specific settings, and achieves high performance metrics on COCO and LVIS datasets.

Conclusion: CoT-PL integrating CoT reasoning and CBL significantly improves the pseudo-labeling process, especially in crowded or occluded scenes, setting a new state of the art in open-vocabulary object detection.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: R-Super提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过利用现有的医疗报告训练AI，从而减少对手动绘制肿瘤掩膜的需求，证明肿瘤掩膜的大规模创建并非不可或缺。

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑轨迹形成时的外部环境和内部路线选择行为，PRTraj填补这一空白，以提高轨迹表示学习效果。

Method: PRTraj通过环境感知模块捕获环境语义，并使用路线选择编码器将轨迹表现为路线选择决策序列，最终整合为全局轨迹表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，PRTraj框架具有卓越的有效性和泛化性，且在少样本场景下展示出优秀的数据效率。

Conclusion: PRTraj在3个真实数据集的5个下游任务中表现优异，并且在少样本场景下依然保持强劲性能。

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: AbdomenAtlas 2.0 offers a large, expertly annotated dataset that significantly improves AI performance in tumor segmentation compared to existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research is driven by the need to improve AI performance in tumor segmentation, hindered by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets.

Method: The study utilizes both a proprietary JHH dataset and a newly created AbdomenAtlas 2.0 dataset, which leverages synthetic data to enhance AI training efficiency.

Result: AbdomenAtlas 2.0 achieved a +7% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) gain in in-distribution tests and +16% in out-of-distribution tests, demonstrating enhanced performance over public datasets.

Conclusion: AbdomenAtlas 2.0 dataset provides a strong foundation for AI-based tumor segmentation, showing significant improvements over existing public datasets.

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Method: The authors propose a general framework named QDepth-VLA that integrates an auxiliary depth prediction task into Vision-Language-Action models. They employ a dedicated depth expert to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps derived from a VQ-VAE encoder, allowing the model to learn depth-aware representations.

Result: Experimental results indicate that QDepth-VLA exhibits strong spatial reasoning abilities and achieves competitive performance compared to existing models on both simulation benchmarks and real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: QDepth-VLA significantly enhances the spatial reasoning capability of Vision-Language-Action models, leading to improved performance in manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出ImagerySearch，一种自适应测试时间搜索策略，改善视频生成模型在想象场景下的表现，并推出LDT-Bench基准测试来评估生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在想象场景中表现较差，特别是涉及到长距离语义关系的罕见共现概念时，因为这些情形超出了训练分布的范围。固定的搜索空间和静态奖励设计限制了其在想象场景中的适应性。

Method: 该研究提出了一种名为ImagerySearch的提示引导自适应测试时间搜索策略，根据提示中的语义关系动态调整推理搜索空间和奖励函数。

Result: 实验结果显示，ImagerySearch在LDT-Bench和VBench基准测试中都表现出色，提高了在挑战性想象场景下生成的视频的连贯性和视觉可信度。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ImagerySearch在LDT-Bench上的表现优于现有的视频生成基线和测试时尺度调整方法，并在VBench上取得了可观的改进效果。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型深度学习框架，能够对皮肤病变进行分类并量化ABCDE特征，实验结果显示分类准确率达到89%，有助于医生更好地理解皮肤癌进展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期发现黑色素瘤极大地提高了生存率，但皮肤病变的自动化分析仍然具有挑战性，因此该研究提出了一种能够解释ABCDE特征的深度学习方法。

Method: 该研究提出了一种深度学习框架，能够将皮肤病变分类，并量化ABCDE特征的评分，还模拟了这些特征随时间的演变，以代表演变（E）维度。此外，还可在潜在空间中可视化ABCD特征的轨迹。

Result: 该分类方法的准确率约为89%，黑色素瘤的AUC为0.96，特征评估在预测不对称性、颜色变化和直径方面表现良好，但边界不规则性更难以建模。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的深度学习框架能够给皮肤病变分类，并量化ABCDE特征的评分。这有助于医生将机器学习的诊断与临床相关标准进行关联，从而提高对皮肤癌进展的理解。

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种自动化数据管道，结合不同视觉模态，通过PHG-MAE模型实现高效数据处理，并在实际应用中取得竞争性结果。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了真正理解世界，需要整合多种模态的信息。

Method: 使用预训练专家和程序化组合，将多种视觉模态整合到一个自动数据管道中，并利用PHG-MAE模型进行处理。

Result: PHG-MAE模型通过<1M参数实现的结果可与约300M参数的模型竞争。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了一种结合多种视觉模态的方法，利用PHG-MAE模型实现了高效多模态数据处理。

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在面部识别方面有待进一步提升，该基准测试为未来模型的设计提供了基础和见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

TL;DR: 提出ScaleWeaver框架，通过参数高效微调和参考注意力模块，实现VAR模型中的高保真、可控生成，效率优于扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型探索了控制机制，但在VAR范式中实现精确和灵活控制仍未被充分研究。为弥合这一关键差距，提出了ScaleWeaver框架。

Method: 引入改进的MMDiT模块和提出的参考注意力模块，通过参数高效微调，结合条件信息，加强控制信息处理。突出参数重用能力，并引入零初始化线性投影以确保控制信号有效整合。

Result: 实验表明，ScaleWeaver可以在保持高质量生成的同时，提供精确控制，并在效率上优于基于扩散的方法。

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver在生成质量和精确控制方面表现出色，比基于扩散的方法效率更高，是视觉自回归范式中可控文本生成图像的实用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: 该研究针对细粒度视觉分类中的多项选择问题，提出了一个两阶段方法，显著提升了开放性回答的分类和检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大型语言模型的崛起，零样本视觉分类任务受到关注。然而，对于自回归模型的自由回答的评估依然是一大挑战，特别是在细粒度视觉分类（FGVC）中，需要处理大量的多项选择题，选择集通常有上百到上千个选项，这些选项之间高度相关。这对现有的只关注语言任务的研究提出了新的要求。

Method: 提出了一种名为nlg2choice的两阶段方法。首先，向多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）提问一个开放性问题，然后使用仅限文本的约束解码来预测最有可能的选择。对于检索场景，使用提前终止方法计算该选择的约束响应概率，以提高处理速度。

Result: 在七个细粒度视觉数据集上进行评估时，该方法在分类和检索方面表现出色，并且这种性能也适用于用户用自然语言实现任务的各种方式。

Conclusion: 提出的方法不但提升了当前细粒度视觉分类任务的性能，同时还提供了一种可行的处理高计算成本多项选择问题的方法，展示了语言模型在自然语言任务实现中的多样性和适应性。

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

Motivation: 现有半监督视频异常检测方法在检测涉及对象互动的复杂异常时表现不佳，且通常缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的VAD框架，通过查询多模态大语言模型，从正常视频中生成对象活动和互动的文本描述，并在测试时通过与训练视频中的文本描述进行比较检测异常。

Result: 通过基准数据集的广泛实验，我们的方法不仅有效检测复杂的基于互动的异常，还在无互动异常的数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种新的视频异常检测框架，利用多模态大语言模型，能够有效检测复杂的基于互动的异常，并在无互动异常的数据集上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Motivation: 解决了在生成视频片段时对场景一致性和摄像头控制的难题，并克服了越过时间边界时动态元素错误保留的问题。

Method: 采用双时空条件方法，并引入3D场景记忆与动态SLAM结合的新动态遮罩策略，来区分静态场景几何结构与动态元素。

Result: 通过实验验证，该框架在场景一致性、摄像头可控性和生成质量上大幅超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DScenePrompt显著优于现有方法，在场景一致性、摄像头可控性和生成质量上表现出色。

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Conclusion: RealDPO 在合成视频质量、文本对齐和运动真实性方面的效果优于现有的先进模型和偏好优化技术。

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Motivation: 目前的大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本推理方面表现优异，但在需要视觉辅助的几何等数学领域却表现不佳，这个差距促使研究者探索增强模型视觉思维链（VCoT）的能力。

Method: 提出了一个名为MathCanvas的框架，通过两阶段方法增强大规模多模态模型的内在视觉思维链能力。第一阶段是视觉操控阶段，利用一个新的1520万对语料预训练模型，以掌握图形生成和编辑的技巧。第二阶段是策略视觉辅助推理阶段，微调模型以学习何时及如何利用视觉辅助进行推理。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: 通过构造一个大规模的多身份数据集及新的训练范式，本研究成功缓解了“复制粘贴”现象，提升了生成质量，并使得生成的图像在姿态和表情上更具可控性。

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

TL;DR: Ponimator是一个基于互动姿态的动画框架，利用条件扩散模型生成和合成互动姿态，支持多种交互动画任务，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密切接触的人际互动姿态能传递丰富的互动动态上下文信息，人类可以通过这些姿态直观地推断上下文并预测可能的过去和未来动态。受到这一观察的启发，作者提出了Ponimator框架。

Method: Ponimator框架使用两种条件扩散模型：一种是基于时间先验的姿态动画生成器，它通过互动姿态生成动态动作序列；另一种是基于空间先验的姿态生成器，当互动姿态不可用时，它可以从单个姿态、文本或两者合成互动姿态。

Result: Ponimator框架支持多种任务，包括基于图像的互动动画、反应动画以及文本到互动的合成，实现了将高质量动作捕捉数据中的互动知识转移到开放世界场景。

Conclusion: 实验证明，Ponimator框架在各种数据集和应用中表现优异，证明了姿态先验的普遍性及其框架的高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需配对数据的新训练方法，通过视觉语言模型的反馈优化扩散模型，表现与传统方法相当，甚至优于部分强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像编辑模型需要大规模的输入-目标配对数据进行有监督微调，这样的大规模配对数据难以整理，因此提出一种无需配对数据的训练方法。

Method: 论文介绍了一种不需要配对数据的新训练范式，直接优化少步扩散模型，通过在训练期间展开模型并利用视觉语言模型（VLM）的反馈进行优化。此外，使用分布匹配损失（DMD）确保生成图像保持在预训练模型学习的图像流形内。

Result: 在标准基准上的评估结果以及广泛的消融研究表明，所提出的方法在无任何配对数据的情况下，在少步设定中表现得与各种基于大规模监督配对数据训练的图像编辑扩散模型相当，并且在给定相同视觉语言模型作为奖励模型时，还优于基于强化学习的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的训练范式，不需要配对数据，同时在视觉语言模型的反馈下优化扩散模型。通过这种方法，在无配对数据的情况下，模型表现与经过大规模监督配对数据训练的模型相当，甚至在使用相同视觉语言模型作为奖励模型时，优于基于强化学习的方法。

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推动原生视觉语言模型（VLMs）克服原生与模块化VLMs间的根本约束，并促进该领域的研究民主化。

Method: 本文提出了一种构建原生视觉语言模型（VLMs）的原则，开发了NEO家族模型，该模型从头开始有效地发展视觉感知，并在其密集的单片模型中缓解视觉-语言冲突。

Result: NEO模型在只有3.9亿图像-文本例子的条件下高效地发展了视觉感知能力，并在与顶级模块化模型的竞争中表现出色。

Conclusion: NEO是一个基础而强大的原生视觉语言模型（VLMs），它能够在多种现实场景中与顶级模块化模型竞争，并成为可扩展的、功能强大的原生VLMs的基石。

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往需要优化显式3D表示，存在优化过程冗长以及在稀疏视图设置下不稳定的问题。为此，本文提出了一种新方法以提高多视图一致性并克服这些问题。

Method: 提出一种隐式3D正则化方法，通过耦合扩散采样同时从多视图图像分布和2D编辑图像分布中采样两个轨迹，引入耦合项来确保生成图像的多视图一致性。

Result: 实验验证了该框架在三种不同的多视图图像编辑任务中的有效性和通用性，展示了其作为多视图一致性编辑通用解决方案的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过约束生成的2D图像序列遵循预训练的多视图图像分布，在多视图一致性图像编辑中有效并且通用。

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合GRPO和对比奖励信号的新框架，大幅提升了文本到SQL系统的执行和语义准确性，尤其在跨语言应用中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到SQL方法主要关注可执行查询，但忽视了查询语义对齐挑战。此外，将这些方法从英语应用于其他语言时，执行准确性显著下降。

Method: 引入了一种新框架，该框架将群体相对策略优化（GRPO）与多语言对比奖励信号结合，以提升文本到SQL系统在跨语言场景中的任务效率和语义准确性。

Result: 在七种语言的MultiSpider数据集上，经过GRPO微调的LLaMA-3-3B模型执行准确性提升至87.4％，语义准确性提升至52.29％。加入对比奖励信号后，平均语义准确性进一步提升到59.14％，其中针对越南语可提升至+10个百分点。

Conclusion: 使用对比奖励信号和GRPO可以显著提高文本到SQL系统的执行和语义准确性，尤其是在跨语言场景中。

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

Motivation: 当前的XAI技术如SHAP和LIME虽然能够提供技术上准确的输出，但无法提供临床上相关的、可操作的见解，这阻碍了其在实际临床中的应用。因此，需要一个能够将技术输出转化为临床可解释信息的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种生成操作框架，利用大语言模型作为翻译引擎，将XAI工具的技术输出与临床指南融合生成临床叙述，通过系统分析各组件，演示其解决关键操作障碍的能力。

Conclusion: 生成操作框架解决了XAI技术与临床实际应用之间的转换问题，并为将AI应用于临床实践提供了战略路线图。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的迅速发展，可靠的治理工具变得至关重要，尤其是能够公开验证的水印技术，以促进可信AI生态系统建设。

Method: 提出了一种新的名为STELA的框架，其根据语言内在的自由度动态调节信号，以保持文本质量和提高水印的可检测性，而无需访问任何模型的logits。

Result: STELA通过广泛的实验证明在多种语言环境下的检测稳健性优于以往方法。

Conclusion: STELA框架在公开可验证的AI模型水印检测中展示了优越的检测稳健性，且不依赖于模型的logits访问。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

Method: 开发了一种期望最大化算法，用于估计用户的潜在质量因子，并据此过滤用户的标注数据。

Conclusion: 提出了一种用于收集成对偏好数据的新方法，通过用户的日常交互来获得偏好标注，并通过用户行为模型进行数据质量的推断，从而提高LLM的对齐效果。

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

Method: 本文提出Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF)模块，这一小型预测模块能在路由决策前估计输出，并采用灵活的执行或近似策略。

Result: 通过大量在语言建模和推理任务上的实验表明，informed routing在多个稀疏度水平上达到了最新的效率性能平衡，不需要LoRA微调即可表现优于需要完整微调的基线模型，同时训练时间减少了50%以上。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为informed routing的新范式，通过引入Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF)模块，在进行路由决策之前预测单元输出，实现了灵活的执行或近似策略，显著提升了大语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

TL;DR: The paper presents HIES, a new pruning criterion for transformer models that combines head importance scores with attention entropy, resulting in improved model quality and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address efficiency challenges in transformer-based models due to their multiple layers and attention heads by improving pruning methods.

Method: The paper introduces HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score), a pruning criterion that integrates head importance scores with attention entropy.

Result: HIES-based pruning results in up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability compared to HIS-only methods.

Conclusion: HIES-based pruning provides complementary evidence to HIS, leading to significant improvements in model quality and stability without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对在大型私有企业数据仓库中查询效率低的问题，手动标注SQL日志并不现实，因此需要一个工具来加速领域特定文本到SQL基准的创建。

Method: BenchPress使用人机交互系统，结合检索增强生成（RAG）和LLM来生成多种自然语言描述，然后由人类专家选择、排序或编辑这些草稿。

Result: BenchPress在注释企业SQL日志的评估中，显著减少了创建高质量基准所需的时间和精力。同时，验证了人类和LLM结合方式在注释准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估稳健性上的提升。

Conclusion: BenchPress通过结合人类验证和LLM生成的建议来提高注释准确性、基准可靠性和模型评估的稳健性，是加速创建领域特定文本到SQL基准的有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑文化差异的仇恨言论检测方法，提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测方法忽略了训练标签有偏见且不同文化背景下个体对仇恨的理解不同的问题。

Method: 提出文化感知框架，通过建构个人仇恨子空间来处理数据稀疏、文化纠缠和标签歧义问题。

Result: 实验表明，我们的方法在所有评价指标上平均超越现有最先进的方法1.05%。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，考虑文化背景的差异能有效提升仇恨言论的识别效果。

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究创建了一个用于检测辅导对话中情感动态的LLM框架，分析发现学生的情绪状态短暂而易变，负面情绪能够快速化解，中性时刻常作为转折点，提供了导师干预的机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近的研究已经考察了大型语言模型在教育环境中的学习影响，但LLM调解的辅导的情感动态仍然未被充分理解。本工作引入了第一个用于大规模情感感知的集成LLM框架，通过关注学习者不断变化的情感状态来推进关于将生成性AI整合到教育中的负责路径的讨论。

Method: 生成三个前沿LLM（Gemini、GPT-4o、Claude）的零样本情感注释，包括效价、唤醒和学习帮助的标量评级，以及自由文本的情感标签。通过模型内排名加权池化和跨模型的多数共识融合这些估计，以生成稳健的情感概况。

Result: 分析表明，学习过程中，解决问题时常见困惑和好奇心，挫败感影响进展。情绪状态短暂，负面情绪常快速化解，中性时刻为转折点。

Conclusion: 我们的分析发现，在与AI导师互动过程中，学生通常报告积极的影响和中等的唤醒。然而，学习过程并不总是顺利的：解决问题时困惑和好奇心是常见的伴随情绪，而挫败感虽然较少见，但仍可能影响进展。情绪状态是短暂的，积极的时刻持续时间略长于中性或负性生活情绪，但它们是脆弱的，容易被打断。令人鼓舞的是，负面情绪经常快速化解，有时直接转变为积极状态。中性时刻常常作为转折点，更频繁地将学生引导向上的方向而非向下方向，这表明导师可以在这些关头进行干预。

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Motivation: 手动构建本体论的过程耗时、昂贵且费力，因此需要研发自动化的方法来完成本体论的提取和构建。

Method: 利用最新的大语言模型技术，开发了一种完全自动化的方法，从原始评论文本中提取产品本体论，以部分关系的形式体现出来。

Result: 所提出的自动化方法在使用大语言模型作为评判标准进行评估时，超越了基于BERT的现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究证明，利用大语言模型（LLMs）自动提取产品本体论的方法优于现有的基于BERT的基线。

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ADMIT, a novel attack method that demonstrates high success in poisoning RAG systems for fact-checking across multiple platforms without direct access to underlying LLMs or data structures, revealing vulnerabilities in existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to investigate the challenges of knowledge poisoning in fact-checking scenarios, where credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool, making it difficult to deceive LLMs.

Method: The authors propose ADMIT, a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that is effective without requiring access to target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control.

Result: ADMIT achieves an average attack success rate of 86% across various retrievers and LLMs with a very low poisoning rate and performs better than previous state-of-the-art attacks by 11.2%.

Conclusion: ADMIT significantly exposes vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems by improving attack success rates while maintaining robustness even against strong counter-evidence.

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

Motivation: 目前的基础模型在处理表格和事件型EHR数据时，与自然语言模型的顺序先验存在结构不匹配问题，难以捕获患者就诊过程中的纵向依赖性。

Method: 提出了SerialBEHRT模型，通过在结构化EHR序列上进行额外预训练以扩展SciBERT，设计用于编码临床事件间的时间和情景关系。

Result: SerialBEHRT在抗生素敏感性预测这一临床问题中表现出色，通过与最先进的EHR表示策略的广泛基准测试，展示了其优越且稳定的性能。

Conclusion: SerialBEHRT模型在健康护理领域中，能够有效地将临床事件的时间序列和情景关系编码到患者表示中，进而在抗生素敏感性预测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DynaSpec的机制，通过上下文动态选择候选词加速drafter步骤，实验表明其在改善验收长度和效率上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型词汇表规模的扩大，drafter的输出头中的参数数量成为延迟瓶颈，导致推测解码过程变慢。当前的方法通过限制drafter的词汇范围来减少计算，但存在需要频繁调整和抑制罕见或专业领域词的缺点。因此，需要一种更灵活且通用的候选选择机制。

Method: DynaSpec方法引入了一种上下文相关的动态候选选择机制，通过使用轻量级的粗粒度元分类器，将上下文路由到一个小数量的token簇。选择的top-k簇的并集形成drafter的简短候选词表，而验证则保留完整词汇以确保精确性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DynaSpec提高了平均接受长度，并且通过上下文相关选择，即使在较小候选词表下，也不会降低接受率。

Conclusion: DynaSpec机制在标准推测解码基准测试中表现出优于固定候选词表基线模型的一致增益，证明其有效性和稳定性。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，该方法在云端和设备上均表现良好，而且速度快。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大型语言模型在使用过程中常出现意外的代码切换现象，这会影响其在后续任务中的可靠性。

Method: 通过对齐平行翻译后的语言方向进行主成分分析（PCA），并沿这些轴引导标记嵌入，以控制语言身份，从而在推理时减少代码切换问题。

Result: 在Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型上的实验中，对单个主成分实现了95-99%的语言分类准确率，并在多个语言对中降低了高达42%的下一个词的分布差异。研究进一步揭示了语言表示在模型层间的演变特征，接近完美地线性分离，主要集中在最后几层。

Conclusion: 提出的潜在空间语言引导方法能有效减轻多语言大型语言模型中的意外代码切换问题，同时在保持语义一致性方面表现优异，且计算开销极小。通过少量的平行数据进行校准即可，实现了跨多语言对的显著改进。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在进行链式推理时的中间步骤是否具有忠实性或是否容易被人类理解，通过引入基于熵的度量来分析信息流动。

Method: 采用基于熵的度量分析信息流动，对三个具有挑战性的数学基准进行测试，发现成功的LLM推理不遵循人类交流中的稳定信息流。

Result: 成功的LLM推理在信息密度上表现出全球性的不均匀性，与人类交流模式形成对照。

Conclusion: 该研究结果挑战了关于机器推理的假设，并为设计可解释和自适应推理模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

TL;DR: EvoEdit是一种新的模型编辑策略，通过顺序零空间对齐减轻灾难性干扰，在实际应用中性能提升明显，速度提高至3.53倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型编辑方法在面对顺序编辑时存在重大局限性，尤其是会发生灾难性干扰，即新编辑会影响之前集成的更新并削弱原有知识。

Method: EvoEdit通过顺序零空间对齐来实现模型编辑。在每次引入新的编辑时，执行顺序零空间对齐，从而在保留知识上保持输出不变性，即使在长编辑序列中也是如此。

Result: 在实际的顺序知识编辑基准测试中，EvoEdit表现优于或与现有的最先进的定位-编辑技术相当，并且达到了最高3.53倍的加速效果。

Conclusion: EvoEdit在实际应用中的性能优于或与现有最先进的定位-编辑技术相当，并且提供了速度上的大幅提升。这表明在信息不断演变的环境中，有必要开发更系统的方法来设计LLM，并且EvoEdit是一种简单但有效的解决方案，具有强大的理论保证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为CoRE的技术，通过利用模型一致性提高语言模型集成的鲁棒性，在多种实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同的LLM展现出不同的优势和劣势，LLM集成有望整合其互补的能力。然而，尽管在提高集成质量方面取得了重大进展，但集成对潜在错误信号的鲁棒性却很少受到关注，这些信号通常来自异构的token化方案和不同的模型专长。

Method: 提出了一种插拔式技术CoRE，它通过利用模型一致性来增强大型语言模型（LLM）集成的鲁棒性。CoRE通过在token级和模型级应用一致性来解决集成中的问题，分别采用低通滤波器来减轻不确定性的token，从而提高细粒度的鲁棒性；并通过增强模型的自信输出和减少模型间差异来提升粗粒度的鲁棒性。

Result: CoRE技术能够在多种基准测试、模型组合和集成策略中提升集成性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，CoRE技术能够在多种基准测试、模型组合和集成策略中提升集成模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

TL;DR: MasonNLP系统使用RAG框架和大型语言模型，在伤口护理视觉问答任务中表现出色，排名第三。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了支持临床决策和患者护理，解决伤口护理视觉问答问题，需要从图像和患者查询中生成自由文本响应和结构化的伤口属性。

Method: MasonNLP 系统使用了一个基础领域、指令调优的大型语言模型，并结合检索增强生成（RAG）框架，通过简单的索引和融合，在推理阶段添加了几个相关的示例，无需额外的训练或复杂的重新排序。

Result: 我们的系统在dBLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore和LLM基于的指标中改善了推理、结构遵从性和响应质量。系统在19个团队和51个提交中排名第三，平均得分为41.37%。

Conclusion: 轻量级的检索增强生成（RAG）结合通用大型语言模型（LLM）为多模态临床自然语言处理任务提供了一个简单而有效的基线。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: ShishuLM optimizes transformers by reducing parameter count and KV cache needs, leading to significant improvements in memory usage and latency for Small Language Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the substantial memory and computational overhead of transformer models and capitalize on identified architectural redundancies for optimization.

Method: ShishuLM architecture leverages insights from AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, using normalization and attention computation to approximate transformer blocks with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

Result: ShishuLM achieves up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40% improvement in latency compared to parent models, demonstrating its efficiency.

Conclusion: ShishuLM architecture significantly reduces memory requirements and improves latency during training and inference compared to parent models, making it a more efficient option for Small Language Models.

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Template Infilling for Diffusion Language Models, resulting in a 17.01% improvement in benchmarks like mathematical reasoning and code generation, by introducing more flexible generation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the limitations of Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) which currently use prefix-based prompting for inference, inherited from autoregressive methods, by introducing a new methodology for more flexible and effective generation.

Method: The proposed method, Template Infilling (TI), generates a structural template for the target output and fills in masked segments. Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA) further boosts TI by allowing adaptive adjustments of segment lengths based on generation confidence.

Result: The proposed approach leads to significant improvements in benchmarks related to mathematical reasoning and code generation, achieving a performance increase of 17.01% over existing baselines.

Conclusion: Template Infilling (TI) combined with Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA) is an effective strategy for enhancing Diffusion Language Models (DLMs), resulting in improved performance in certain benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Motivation: 法语肿瘤学的自然语言处理工具开发需要注释数据集，但这方面的资源相对稀缺。

Method: FRACCO 数据集的构建通过将西班牙语 CANTEMIST 语料库翻译成法语，并由两个领域专家对文本中的实体范围进行手动注释而完成。此外，通过结合自动匹配和五名标注人员的手动验证，共产生了 71127 个 ICD-O 标准化术语。

Conclusion: FRACCO数据集为法语肿瘤学文本中的命名实体识别和概念规范化提供了参考标准。

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires

Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is
annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic
differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for

composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain
experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a
combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five
annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from
2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip通过门控机制有效控制计算量与精度平衡，为Transformer信息流提供洞见，并易于与量化、剪枝等技术结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决早退出或基于路由的深度混合模型的不稳定性，并降低计算成本。

Method: 在每个Attention/MLP分支上引入Sigmoid-Linear门控机制，决定每个token是否跳过，并在推理阶段根据门控值排名和分层预算选择性跳过。

Result: 在长形式推理中可节省高达15%的计算量，同时保留超过90%的基线准确性。在指令调优模型上，在完整计算量下提高准确性，并在节省接近50%计算量时匹配基线质量。

Conclusion: GateSkip机制能够有效地选择性跳过decoder-only语言模型中的低重要性token，同时保持稳定性和精度。

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在无数字提示下，通过自然语言进行不确定性下顺序决策的能力。

Method: 设计一个新颖的基准测试，让大型语言模型在纯文本反馈的多臂老虎机环境中进行交互。对四种开源大型语言模型进行评估，并将其与传统决策算法（如汤普森采样、贪婪算法、UCB和随机选择）进行比较。

Result: Qwen3-4B选取最优策略的成功率达到89.2%，明显优于其他大型语言模型和传统决策方法，但大多数语言模型相较基准表现较差。

Conclusion: Qwen3-4B在仅依赖于语言线索的多臂老虎机环境中表现出众，显示出语言模型也可以在无数字提示的情况下进行概率推断。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态调整语言模型计算资源使用的有效方法，以提高模型在不同标记复杂度和上下文下的准确性和效率。

Method: 探讨一种语言模型的监督训练目标，该目标允许模型在处理输入标记时动态调节计算步骤的数量。该方法使用<don't know>输出请求额外的计算步骤，并使用特定的<pause>标记提供额外的计算资源。通过顺序决策问题的方法来训练模型合理使用<don't know>输出并校准其不确定性。本文研究了三种CYB损失方法：CYB-AP（随时预测），CYB-VA（变分方法），CYB-DP（计算预算惩罚）。

Result: CYB模型在需要时请求额外步骤以提高准确性，并根据上下文和词级复杂度调整处理时间。该模型相对于无暂停模型与交叉熵损失模型更为高效，仅需其一半或三分之一的数据便能实现相同的性能。

Conclusion: CYB模型比无暂停模型和带有暂停和交叉熵损失的模型更有效地利用训练数据，且能够根据上下文和词级复杂度自适应地调整计算时间。

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

TL;DR: Open-ended LLM generative capabilities improve social simulation realism, providing better methodology, less bias, and new insights. Calls for frameworks enabling LLMs' full generative potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the benefits of using open-ended text generation in LLMs for social simulations, and to address the limitations of traditional closed-design formats which overlook the generative nature of LLMs in capturing detailed human-like expressions and reasoning.

Method: The paper utilizes a position paper approach, leveraging survey-methodology research and recent advances in NLP to discuss the benefits and strategies for using open-ended systems in LLM social simulations.

Result: The open-ended approach allows for improved measurement and design in social simulations, supports exploration of unforeseen perspectives, reduces directive bias, and enhances expressiveness, individuality, pretesting, and overall methodological utility.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that open-ended generative capabilities of LLMs provide significant benefits for realistic social simulations, enhancing methodological utility and creating synergies between NLP and social sciences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

Motivation: 动机在于评估大型语言模型在无结构文本分类任务中的性能，特别是在其快速发展的背景下，探讨是否规模和架构改进可提高分类准确性。

Method: 这项研究使用了一个包含8,660个人工标记样本的统一数据集，以及一致的零样本提示，来评估10个最先进的大型语言模型在IAB 2.2层级分类架构下的表现。采用的评估指标包括准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数，以及特定于LLM的幻觉比例、膨胀比例和分类成本。

Result: 研究发现，尽管LLMs取得了进展，其在经典性能指标上的表现仅为中等。此外，某些模型常常相对于人工标注者过多地生成类别。合奏方法的应用显示出显著的改善，能够提高准确性并消除幻觉。

Conclusion: 研究表明，尽管LLMs发展迅速，其在无结构文本分类上的经典表现仍然有限。通过协调多个模型，即合奏方法，可以显著改善分类准确性并减少错误分类现象。

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

TL;DR: THTB框架通过更高的认知指令选择与标注指导提升训练效率和模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中过度依赖LLMs的内部知识，解释性弱，泛化能力有限的问题

Method: 提出THTB框架，通过质量过滤和内在、外在难度评分相结合的方法进行数据选择和标注指导

Result: 实验表明，训练数据的5%可以超过全数据集训练，且泛化能力优于仅依赖LLM的选择方法

Conclusion: THTB框架在垂直领域提供有效的标注指导，展示了强大的领域适应能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our
code, datasets, and models are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高对大语言模型(Large Language Models, LLMs)安全威胁的理解，特别是针对越狱技术的有效性进行评估。

Method: 通过结构化的红队挑战进行研究，发展了新的分类法及数据集，并进行建模和评估。

Result: 研究发展了一种新的分类法，其次分析了不同攻击类型的成功率，验证了分类法引导提示对自动检测的提升，并编译了新的意大利语对话数据集，为逐步显现的对抗性意图的研究提供了支持。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种综合的分层分类法，将50种越狱策略整合并扩展为七大类族，提高了对大语言模型越狱技术的理解，并为自动检测技术提供了支持。

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

TL;DR: 研究评估了两种作者归因方法在不同领域的表现，显示出方法间的互补性，并提供了可复现的评估框架和相应代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，机器生成的文本在写作能力上接近人类，这使得作者归因变得更加复杂。鉴于此背景，该研究希望通过对比两种归因机制，即固定风格嵌入和基于指令微调的LLM评审器（GPT-4o），在不同领域中评估其效果。

Method: 研究使用了Human AI Parallel Corpus，一个包含600个平衡实例的公开数据集，这些实例跨越六个领域：学术、新闻、小说、博客、口语转录和电视/电影剧本。每个实例包含一个人类提示，以及来自GPT-4o或LLaMA-70B-Instruct的机器生成的继续文本。研究对比了固定风格嵌入基线和LLM Judge的准确性表现。

Result: 研究结果表明，固定风格嵌入在GPT生成的文本上表现出较高的总体准确率（82% 对比 68%），而LLM Judge在LLaMA生成的文本上略优（85% 对比 81%），尽管统计上不显著。值得注意的是，LLM Judge显著优于小说和学术散文领域，显示出语义敏感性，而风格嵌入在口语和剧本对话中表现更好，体现出其结构性优势。

Conclusion: 结论是，作者归因是一个多维度的问题，需要混合策略来应对。研究强调了在不同文本领域中，不同方法的优势互补，并通过提供开放的可重复使用的框架支持未来研究的发展。

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing

TL;DR: RAID以低查询和低计算成本率成功绕过LLM防御，表明嵌入空间正则化对缓解模型漏洞至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种任务中表现出色，但易受绕过安全机制的越狱攻击。本文提出RAID框架，系统地探测这些弱点，通过精心制作的对抗性后缀在保持流畅性的同时引入受限内容。

Method: RAID放松离散的标记为连续的嵌入，并通过联合目标优化它们：（i）鼓励受限的响应，（ii）引入拒绝感知正则器，将激活从嵌入空间的拒绝方向引导开，（iii）应用一致性项以保持语义合理性和无冗余。在优化之后，评论员指导的解码过程通过平衡嵌入亲和力与语言模型似然性将嵌入映射回标记。

Result: RAID在多个开源LLM上的实验中，在攻击成功率、查询次数和计算成本方面优于最近的白箱和黑箱基线。

Conclusion: RAID能够生成有效的后缀，既能绕过防御，又保持自然的形式。在多个开源LLM上的实验显示，RAID与最近的白箱和黑箱基线相比，以更少的查询和更低的计算成本取得了更高的攻击成功率。这些发现强调了嵌入空间正则化在理解和缓解LLM越狱漏洞中的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在复杂政治和道德领域中的潜在偏见，以及其在角色扮演场景中的意识形态取向。

Method: 通过比较LLM的MFT（道德基础理论）响应与现有人类研究数据，分析其意识形态倾向。

Result: 研究分析表明，LLM在回答过程中可能表现出对某一政治意识形态的偏好，且其在显式提示和基于人口统计的角色扮演中的表现值得关注。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析LLM在不同条件和实验中的行为，本研究揭示了AI生成的回答中政治和人口统计依赖的程度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

Motivation: 传统的示例驱动ICL缺乏显式的知识检索和转移模块，因此通过图式理论提高LLM的推理能力。

Method: 引入认知科学中的图式理论，通过创建抽象的图式来强化模型的推理过程。

Result: SA-ICL在GPQA数据集上的化学和物理问题中显著提高性能，最高提升36.19%。

Conclusion: SA-ICL显著提升模型性能，并减少对示例数量的依赖，同时增强模型的可解释性。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种无标签提示优化的新方法PDO，利用LLM评委的偏好反馈进行优化，实验结果优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法大多依赖于高质量的标签数据集，而获取这些标签数据集既昂贵又耗时，因此我们需要一种在无标签的情况下也能有效工作的优化方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种名为Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO)的框架，用于无标签环境下的提示优化。PDO利用双托普森采样(D-TS)进行提示对比，并通过引入优秀提示的变异来扩大候选池。

Result: 在BIG-bench Hard (BBH) 和 MS MARCO上的实验表明，PDO在无标签环境中优于基线方法，消融研究也证实了D-TS和提示变异方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 实验表明，Prompt Duel Optimizer (PDO) 在无标签和部分标签环境中都优于基线方法，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理能力上表现出色，但在算术任务上仍有困难。本研究旨在探讨这些模型内部处理算术计算的结构。

Method: 使用开源的指令调优模型LLaMA 3.2-3B及一个包含三个操作数和两个操作符的算术表达式数据集，研究了模型的内部结构。应用了可解释性技术如logit lens、线性分类探针和UMAP几何可视化等来追踪中间结果。

Result: 研究发现，中间计算确实存在于残差流中，尤其是在MLP块之后。同时，模型能够在线性编码每个操作符嵌入的优先级，并引入了部分嵌入交换技术，以通过交换操作符之间的高影响力嵌入维度来修改操作符优先级。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型在执行算术运算时，其内部确实存在操作符优先级的编码，尤其在MLP块之后表现明显。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

Motivation: 现有的LLM-based KGR方法在处理生成幻觉方面存在困难，严重影响了推理结果的可信度。为了克服这些局限性，提出了新的方法。

Method: 设计了一种知识推理语言（KRL）指令格式和KRL分词器，用于对齐LLM知识和KG表示。还提出了一个KRL注意力层，通过动态知识记忆机制协调内在LLM知识和额外的KG上下文。最后，提出了一种结构感知的下一个实体预测器，将推理结果严格限制在可信知识域内。

Result: 在25个实际的诱导KGR数据集上进行的广泛实验证明，其在零样本推理和微调场景中的明显优势。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种知识推理语言模型（KRLM），通过在KGR过程中统一协调LLM知识和KG上下文，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are
available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot
reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Motivation: 探索 AI 辩论如何在没有数据集真相的情况下作为监督技术，尤其是在主观问题上的应用，以及模型在此类环境中是否会放弃其先前的信念。

Method: 应用辩论于主观问题，并在实验前明确测量大型语言模型的先验信念。辩手被要求选择偏好的立场，然后结合有意与其先验信念冲突的裁判角色，以测试模型是否使用迎合策略或坚持先前信念。

Result: 研究发现，模型倾向于选择与裁判角色一致的立场，而不是坚持先前的信念；顺序辩论引入了显著的偏见，偏向第二个辩手；模型在捍卫与其先前信念一致的立场时更有说服力，然而，与先前信念不一致的论点在两两比较中被评为质量更高。

Conclusion: 结果表明，模型更倾向于支持与裁判角色一致的立场，而不是其先前的信念。顺序辩论引入偏见，更有利于第二辩手。尽管模型在支持一致立场时更具说服力，但不一致立场常被认为是更高质量的论点。这一发现可以帮助人类裁判提供更高质量的训练信号，同时揭示了语言模型中关于说服动态的重要方面。

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

TL;DR: 小型语言模型的文本生成能力并非仅由训练文本的可读性决定，统计简单性更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对小型语言模型进行训练时，可读性被视为影响模型生成连贯文本能力的关键因素。但该研究质疑这一观点，通过实验验证可读性与模型学习效率之间的关系。

Method: 构建匹配结构但可读性不同的合成数据集，比较不同复杂度文本训练的小型语言模型的表现。

Result: 研究发现，使用复杂的成人级文本训练的模型在连贯性发展方面不输于使用简化语言训练的模型，且连贯性的发展速度更快。

Conclusion: 研究表明，可读性并不是预测小型语言模型生成连贯文本能力的唯一因素。统计简单性，如n-gram多样性，是预测可学性的更强指标。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种通过自然语言有效表示化学元素的方法，希望该研究能够推动材料科学中由AI驱动的发现。

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新的信号结合框架，通过加权聚合LLM和PRM的信号来提升TTS效率，并验证其在多个模型中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在测试时刻缩放（TTS）中，如何有效利用PRM的验证信号的问题，特别是当简单多数投票法在某些情况下优于基于PRM的方法时。

Method: 开发一个理论框架，通过加权聚合来最优地结合大型语言模型（LLM）和过程奖励模型（PRM）的信号。根据理论推导出最佳权重估计，并通过有效的预计算方法校准这些权重函数。

Result: 实验表明，校准后的加权聚合方法在提升TTS效率方面显著优于传统的加权多数投票法，并且仅使用了21.3%的计算资源。

Conclusion: 智能的信号聚合策略可以在测试时刻带来性能提升，相比之下，仅依赖增加计算量并不是最优策略。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

### [133] [FACTS: Table Summarization via Offline Template Generation with Agentic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13920)
*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FACTS is a new method for query-focused table summarization that uses reusable offline templates to improve performance and efficiency while maintaining privacy compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve query-focused table summarization by addressing existing limitations like costly fine-tuning, complex reasoning issues, token limits, efficiency concerns, and lack of robustness and scalability in previous methods.

Method: FACTS uses an agentic workflow that includes offline template generation with SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which are reusable across tables with the same schema.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks for query-focused table summarization.

Conclusion: FACTS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, making it a practical solution for query-focused table summarization.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table
schemas to LLMs. Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS
consistently outperforms baseline methods, establishing it as a practical
solution for real-world query-focused table summarization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在不良事件预测中是否会纳入社会人口因素，而这些因素在临床上并无相关性。

Method: 使用美国食品药品监督管理局的不良事件报告系统的结构化数据，并结合角色评估框架，对两种前沿模型进行评估。

Result: 结果显示模型在不良事件预测的准确性上存在系统性差异，社会经济地位较低的群体比地位较高的群体被预测为更高的不良事件可能性。此外，存在显性及隐性偏见。

Conclusion: 研究发现大型语言模型在药物安全预测中存在系统性偏见，尤其是针对某些社会经济弱势群体。需要在临床应用之前进行公平评估与偏差缓解策略的开发。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

*Kenan Alkiek,David Jurgens,Vinod Vydiswaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过在推理时使用检索到的结构化指令，小型语言模型在复杂推理任务上的表现得到了提升，尤其是在医疗和法律等专业领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在本地硬件上运行高效且具备强隐私性、低成本及减少环境影响的优势，但在需要多步骤推理或特定领域知识的任务上表现不佳。本文旨在解决这一局限性。

Method: SLM通过在推理时进行指令干预来提高推理能力，具体操作是在推理过程中使用检索到的结构化推理过程，而不是从头开始生成。该方法通过将相似的训练问题分组并在GPT-5的帮助下创建指令，形成一个指令语料库。在推理时，SLM检索最相关的指令并按照其步骤进行操作。

Result: 在无额外微调的情况下，指令检索方法在多个数据集上带来了显著提升：在MedQA上提升了9.4%，在MMLU法律上提升了7.9%，在MathQA上提升了5.1%。

Conclusion: 指令检索提供的结构化指引比生成文本片段的方法更能有效地提高小型语言模型的推理能力，尽管改善效果取决于模型的家族和内在推理能力，但指令的简洁性通常优于冗长性。

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

TL;DR: 研究显示，经过微调的AI生成文本在风格忠实度和写作质量上超过了MFA训练的专家作家，且被读者广泛接受，支持了AI生成内容在版权市场中的潜在价值影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决关于AI能否生成高质量文学文本并模仿作者风格的疑问，同时回应因AI使用版权书籍训练而引发的众多诉讼。

Method: 研究比较了经过MFA训练的专家作家与三种尖端AI模型（ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini）在模仿50位获奖作家的不同风格时所撰写的最多450字的摘录。通过对159名专家和普通读者进行盲态配对评估，分析AI生成文本的风格忠实度和写作质量。实验偏重于使用AI微调训练后的文本进行比较，以确定其效果。在媒介分析中，比较了未经微调和经过微调的AI文本以及AI检测的准确性。

Result: 初步实验中未经微调的AI生成文字不被专家看好，尤其是在风格忠实度和写作质量方面。然而，微调后，结果彻底逆转：专家普遍更青睐AI生成的文本，同时一般读者也显示相似的倾向，并且微调后输出文本很少被AI检测器识别为机器生成的。

Conclusion: 作者特定的微调使得AI生成的写作能够超越专家的人工写作，并受到读者的更大欢迎。这一结果提供了与版权的第四个合理使用因素直接相关的实证证据，即对源作品潜在市场或价值的影响。

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理不确定性通常集中在少部分高熵标记上，基于此现象提出一种MTI框架，以极小开销提高推理准确性与稳定性，且在多任务中取得明显提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在不牺牲效率的情况下提高推理的计算能力，探索了推理不确定性影响输出正确性的现象，发现推理不确定性高度局部化的特性可以被优化利用。

Method: 提出了一种名为MTI（Minimal Test-Time Intervention）的训练无关框架，通过选择性地在不确定位置应用无分类器指导和使用轻量级负面提示指导，重新利用主模型的KV缓存进行无条件解码，从而增强推理的准确性和稳定性，同时保持较低开销。

Result: MTI在多种任务（例如普通任务、编码任务和STEM任务）上都表现出一致的改善。具体而言，在八个基准测试中，Qwen3-8B-Base平均提升1.35%，在AIME2024中使用Qwen3-32B-Reasoning提升5%。

Conclusion: MTI框架能够有效利用推理不确定性高度局部化的特性，通过最小的测试时干预，增强大语言模型的推理性能，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

Result: 提供了对RAG系统中各种错误类型进行分类的方法，并通过数据集和自动评估技术帮助开发者在实际应用中识别和解决错误。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的错误类型分类法，并设计了一种自动评估方法，以识别和处理RAG系统中的错误。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the German Commons, the largest openly licensed German text collection, supporting the development of open language models with 154.56 billion tokens from multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of insufficient openly licensed training data for language models, especially for non-English languages like German.

Method: Data from 41 sources across multiple domains were systematically sourced and processed using quality filtering, deduplication, and text formatting to create a corpus with 154.56 billion tokens. The processing ensures high-quality and legally compliant text suitable for language model training.

Result: The creation of the largest openly licensed German text collection, with 154.56 billion tokens, covering multiple domains, ensuring quality and legal compliance for model training.

Conclusion: The German Commons provides a comprehensive and openly licensed corpus of German text, addressing the scarcity of such resources for non-English languages, thereby supporting the development of open German language models.

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的答案准确性评分无法充分反映对文化理解的评估。

Method: 引入CRaFT（解释为基础的多语言评估框架），使用四个可解释的指标评估模型解释：文化流畅性、偏差、一致性和语言适应性。

Result: 阿拉伯语降低了文化流畅性，孟加拉语提高了文化流畅性，西班牙语的文化流畅性大体上保持稳定。GPT模型在跨语言适应性上表现更好，但一致性较低；FANAR表现稳定但推理僵硬。

Conclusion: CRaFT框架揭示了LLM在跨文化上下文中推理的显著变化，表明文化意识不是内在特质，而是在语言框架中显现出来的。

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

Conclusion: 该论文指出，大型语言模型由于语言模式的影响，可能会在推理能力上表现出偏差，并提出了一种新的评估任务来测试这些偏差。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

TL;DR: ERGO improves LLM performance in multi-turn conversations by leveraging uncertainty, resulting in higher accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address performance degradation in multi-turn conversations of LLMs due to abrupt increases in model uncertainty.

Method: ERGO uses Shannon entropy to quantify internal uncertainty in LLMs during multi-turn conversations and triggers prompt consolidation when a spike in entropy is detected.

Result: ERGO achieves a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases peak performance capability by 24.7%, and decreases performance variability by 35.3%.

Conclusion: ERGO significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-turn conversations by embracing uncertainty as a key signal, leading to better accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖于强分布假设或辅助校准模块，针对这个问题，该研究设计了一个紧凑的端到端框架。

Method: DROID结合了通用句子编码器和基于Transformer的降噪自动编码器的双编码器体系，通过简单的校准实现了跨领域的意图检测。

Result: DROID在多个意图基准上实现了显著的宏F1提升，已知意图提升6-15％，OOS意图提升8-20％。

Conclusion: DROID在多种意图基准上都优于最近的最新技术基线，尤其是在低资源环境中。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

TL;DR: 通过RLSR方法在增强LLM模型指令跟随能力上取得重大进展，结合SFT使用效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了增强指令跟随能力、减轻不良响应、改善推理能力并实现高效的领域适应。

Method: 提出RLSR方法，利用RL框架和SFT数据集，通过比较生成与人工标注响应在语义嵌入空间的余弦相似度来优化模型。

Result: RLSR在指令跟随基准测试中显示出优越性能，例如在Qwen-7B(INFINITY)上的性能优于SFT。在结合SFT的情况下，性能进一步增强。

Conclusion: RLSR在提高基础模型跟随指令能力方面表现优异，结合SFT和RLSR在下游任务性能上获得进一步提升。

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved

### [146] [LiteStage: Latency-aware Layer Skipping for Multi-stage Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14211)
*Beomseok Kang,Jiwon Song,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiteStage enhances multi-stage reasoning by reducing latency and improving speed up to 1.70 times with minimal accuracy loss through a novel layer skipping framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the challenges faced by existing adaptive acceleration techniques in balancing efficiency and accuracy within multi-stage reasoning systems, specifically the issues of stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity and redundant output token generation.

Method: The paper introduces LiteStage, which employs a stage-wise offline search for optimal layer budget allocation combined with an online confidence-based early exit mechanism to reduce latency in multi-stage reasoning.

Result: LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup in processing with less than 4.0% loss in accuracy, surpassing previous layer skipping methods that do not require training.

Conclusion: LiteStage significantly improves the efficiency of multi-stage reasoning by allowing faster computation with minimal accuracy loss, as evidenced by experimental results on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种无监督训练方法 F^2C，以提高大语言模型面对不同提示措辞时的一致性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在面对相同提示不同措辞时产生不一致答案的问题。

Method: 提出 Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$)，包括两个关键组件：共识交叉熵（CCE）和表示对齐损失，用于提高对提示扰动的鲁棒性。

Result: 在 11 个数据集上进行测试，$F^2C$ 平均提高了 11.62% 的一致性，提高了 8.94% 的平均 F1 分数，减少了 3.29% 的性能方差。在域外评估中也能有效泛化。

Conclusion: F^2C 提供了一种有效的无监督方法，可以增强大语言模型在提示扰动下的一致性、性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

TL;DR: MoM框架通过模拟人类认知，优化文档分块和记忆提取，增强了语言模型的文本处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG范式在文本理解和推理能力上存在局限。因此，提出MoM框架，以模拟人类认知过程，提升文档处理的主动性和深度。

Method: MoM框架通过模拟领域专家，利用多路径采样、多视角评估机制进行文档逻辑大纲生成和内容提取。同时，采用逆向推理策略提升小型语言模型的阅读能力，最后开发三级文档记忆检索机制。

Result: MoM框架在三个不同领域的广泛实验中表现优异，不仅解决了RAG系统中的文本分块挑战，还为小型语言模型提供了人性化的智能文本处理路径。

Conclusion: MoM框架克服了传统RAG系统的文本分块问题，为大型语言模型提供了语义完整的文档记忆，并促进了小型语言模型实现以人为本的智能文本处理。

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过修改训练数据研究语言模型行为的方法，并验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系，验证现有的识别相关训练文档的方法是否能够充分解释语言模型正确回答问题的能力。

Method: 我们详细说明了在数据批次上进行干预的方法，包括从评估基准中选择评估项目，匹配相关文档，对文档进行修改并重新训练模型，然后测量这些干预措施的效果。

Result: 通过事实知识获取案例研究，我们证明了现有的方法并不能完全解释语言模型的行为，而我们的方法可以补充现有的关联分析。

Conclusion: 我们介绍了一种实验方法，通过修改训练数据来研究训练数据与语言模型行为之间的关系。我们的实验通过多个阶段的干预步骤，证明了这种方法在研究模型行为与训练数据的联系方面的有效性。

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

Motivation: 当前的Graph-based RAG系统在知识图谱构建中噪声较大，导致检索和生成性能下降且计算成本增加。为了提高图谱质量并改善系统性能，迫切需要解决这些知识图谱中的去噪问题。

Conclusion: DEG-RAG框架通过实体解析和三元组反射方法去除噪声，从而提高知识图谱质量，并在不同的Graph-based RAG变体中提高问答性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型多语言模型通常在多语言任务中表现良好，但在检索任务中表现落后于较大型模型。因此，研究能否对小型模型进行改进以提升其在检索任务中的表现。

Method: 研究在不同因素下训练多语言嵌入模型的有效性，特别是在训练数据规模、负例采样策略和数据多样性方面的影响。

Result: 开发出一个大约300M的多语言模型，其在检索任务中的表现可与目前强大的7B模型相媲美甚至超过。

Conclusion: 通过增加硬性负例和关注任务多样性，可以在不显著增加模型大小的情况下提高小型多语言模型的检索性能。

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

Method: 提出了Qwen3Guard，包括生成型Qwen3Guard用于指令跟随任务中的细粒度三分类判断，以及流式Qwen3Guard用于实时增量文本生成的实时安全监控。两者均支持多种语言和方言，提供低延迟安全管理。

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard有效解决了现有护栏模型在输出安全方面的限制，提供了对全球大型语言模型部署的全面和低延迟的安全监管。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进Text-to-SQL系统模式连接的框架，通过增强模式元素检索，提高了模式召回率，减少误检率，并提升了SQL生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管最近的方法主要致力于改善SQL生成，但往往忽视了相关模式元素的检索，导致幻觉和执行失败。因此，提出专门针对模式连接的框架是为了改善这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种将模式连接视为独立问题的上下文感知双向模式检索框架。具体方法包括两个互补策略：首先进行表优先检索，然后进行列选择；以及列优先检索，随后进行表选择。此外，方法还结合了问题分解、关键词提取和关键短语提取技术。

Result: 通过在诸如BIRD和Spider等具有挑战性基准上的全面评估，证明了该方法不仅在待选模式召回上有显著提升，而且减少了误检率。同时，使用该方法检索到的模式进行SQL生成，性能优于全模式基线，并接近最优性能且无需查询优化。此外，该方法将全模式与完美模式之间的性能差距缩小了50%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的上下文感知双向模式检索框架可以显著提高待选模式的召回率，并减少误检率。

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在全球与数百万人交互，但其可能产生欺骗性输出的能力引发了重大的安全问题。

Method: 提出信念不一致度量衡量欺骗，使用五种欺骗检测指标和新的度量进行评估，并引入多轮强化学习方法调优LLMs以减少欺骗行为。

Result: 研究发现，提出的信念不一致度量与人类判断的相关性更高，并且经过多轮强化学习调优后，欺骗行为减少了77.6%。

Conclusion: 研究结论表明，尽管采用了深度强化学习训练，广泛应用的LLMs仍然在对话中表现实质性的欺骗行为，需要更精细的多轮分析和调优来减少欺骗性行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

TL;DR: The study investigates LLMs in role-playing superhero characters across 30 heroes and 90 versions, revealing challenges in canonical accuracy and reasoning alignment, particularly in multiverses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capacity of large language models in consistently portraying version-specific characters, specifically within the superhero genre, which presents multiple versions of the same character across different storylines.

Method: The benchmark introduces two tasks: Canon Events for factual recall and Moral Dilemmas for ethical decision-making, utilizing Think-Act Matching as a metric for evaluating character portrayal accuracy and reasoning fidelity.

Result: Experiments reveal that chain-of-thought prompting can enhance narrative coherence but may compromise canonical accuracy, cross-version generalization is difficult, and models typically excel in either reasoning or decision-making, not both.

Conclusion: Beyond One World benchmark highlights the difficulties LLMs face in maintaining multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment when role-playing as canon-specific characters.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需微调的信心驱动多模型框架，通过模型协作提高医学问答性能，在资源受限的环境中实现先进的医学AI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前高性能的医学大型语言模型需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了资源有限的医疗机构的可访问性。

Method: 该框架使用两阶段架构：信心检测模块评估主模型的确定性，自适应路由机制将低信心查询转发给具有互补知识的Helper模型进行协作推理。

Result: 该研究提出了一种信心驱动的多模型框架，通过模型多样性提高医学问答的性能，而无需对模型进行微调。结果表明，该框架在多个医学基准测试中表现出色，尤其是在PubMedQA和MedMCQA上表现突出。消融研究进一步表明，信心感知的路由结合多模型协作显著优于单一模型方法和统一推理策略。

Conclusion: 研究表明，策略性的模型协作提供了一种实用且计算高效的路径，可以改进医学AI系统，在资源有限的环境中具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究动机是调查现代LLM在字符级常见和结构化扰动下的弹性，尤其是为了防止LLM在某些场景下的误用，如在线考试系统。

Method: 提出了一种称为\nameshort{}的方法，通过插入不可见的Unicode控制字符来实现字符级扰动。进行了广泛的模型、问题和噪音相关配置的评估。

Result: 研究表明，尽管发生了强烈的混淆，令标记化分散并显著降低了信噪比，许多LLM仍维持了显著的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究分析表明，即使在字符级扰动下，许多现代LLM仍然具备显著的性能表现。

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Motivation: 分析当前的问题回答系统在应对需要从多个相关文档中聚合信息的问题时的表现，并提出一种改进的方法。

Method: 提出了一种新的RAG架构PluriHopRAG，通过将查询分解为文档级的子问题，并使用交叉编码过滤器来丢弃不相关的文档，从而提高问答系统的性能。

Result: PluriHopRAG在不同基础LLM上的F1分数相对提高了18-52%，即使在数据集规模较小的情况下，显示出其在应对重复性高和干扰性强的语料库方面的优势。

Conclusion: 当前的问答系统在处理重复性高和干扰性强的文档集合时存在局限性，提出的PluriHopRAG方法通过更全面的检索和早期的过滤提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Motivation: 先前的研究多集中于检测社交媒体上的单个自杀表达，但很少关注分析用户随时间变化的连续评论树以预测用户不断变化的自杀风险。本研究旨在通过评论树的信息来预测用户的自杀风险水平。

Method: 本研究通过分析Reddit上的用户发布历史和评论，并使用基于哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评分量表(C-SSRS)的四标签注释框架构建了高质量的注释数据集，此外，进行了大型语言模型（LLMs）实验以验证方法有效性。

Result: 统计分析和实验结果表明，结合评论树数据显著提高了用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Conclusion: 结合评论树的数据可以显著提高对用户自杀风险水平的区分和预测能力。

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which objective, between contrastive learning and supervised fine-tuning, is better suited for reranking with large language models and understand the underlying mechanism.

Method: Comprehensive comparison and analysis between contrastive learning and supervised fine-tuning in universal multimodal retrieval, involving probing experiments and large-scale training.

Result: SFT provides a stronger weighting scheme than CL, resulting in a consistent advantage for LLM reranking and achieving new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark.

Conclusion: SFT (supervised fine-tuning) is more advantageous than CL (contrastive learning) for LLM (large language model) reranking due to its stronger weighting scheme, leading to enhanced reranker performance.

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

TL;DR: The paper presents a self-supervised RL framework to improve language models' ability to follow multi-constraint instructions, showing enhanced performance and generalization across various datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the difficulty language models face in following multi-constraint instructions, which are vital for real-world applications. Traditional RL methods are limited due to their reliance on external supervision and sparse reward signals.

Method: The authors introduce a label-free, self-supervised reinforcement learning framework. This framework derives reward signals from the instructions themselves and creates pseudo-labels for training the reward model. It employs constraint decomposition strategies and constraint-wise binary classification to handle sparse reward issues and maintain computational efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework shows strong improvements in handling multi-constraint tasks and demonstrates good generalization across diverse datasets, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed label-free self-supervised RL framework generalizes well across multiple datasets and improves performance in multi-constraint instruction following tasks.

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that
are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward
signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL
framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward
signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward
model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and
efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward
challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that
our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain
and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn
instruction following. The data and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 研究多模式生成模型在处理方言文本输入时的有效性，并探索可能的缓解方法，以提高方言输入下的生成质量，同时不影响标准美式英语的性能。

Method: 构建了一个跨越六种常见英语方言的大规模基准，并收集了超过4200个独特提示，评估了17个图像和视频生成模型。提出了一种新的基于编码器的缓解策略，使生成模型能够识别新的方言特征。

Result: 当前的多模式生成模型在使用单个方言词的提示时，性能出现32.26%到48.17%的下降。普通缓解方法如微调和提示重写仅能提升小幅度性能，并可能导致标准美式英语性能的显著下降。提出的缓解策略在五种方言上的表现与标准美式英语持平，提升了34.4%，且几乎不影响美式英语的性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，当前最先进的多模式生成模型在处理方言文本输入时存在显著的性能下降。作者设计了一种基于编码器的通用缓解策略，使模型能够识别新的方言特征，同时保持标准美式英语的性能。

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

Motivation: 解决 seq2seq 共指模型在增量场景（如对话）中，因需要顺序处理文本而导致的灵活性和效率下降问题。

Method: 通过提取和重新组织实体级别的标记，并丢弃大多数其他输入标记来实现压缩表示，增强在增量场景中的效率。

Result: 在 OntoNotes 数据集上，最佳模型仅比完整前缀增量基线低 0.6 CoNLL F1 分，而压缩比达到 1.8。在 LitBank 数据集上，超过了最新技术水准。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过压缩表示和重新组织实体级别的标记来提高增量场景中的效率，同时丢弃了大部分其他输入标记，这在减少计算负担的同时仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一个新数据集和分析框架，用于评估主权LLM的社会文化元素及其技术稳健性。实验结果表明，虽然主权LLM在支持低资源语言方面起到了有意义的作用，但它们并不总是能够很好地服务于目标用户。

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

Motivation: 分析现有偏好学习方法在去除客观质量信号后的性能下降问题，并探索如何更好地建模主观质量偏好。

Method: 研究使用了WritingPreferenceBench，这是一个包含1,800个人工注释偏好对的数据集，并比较了序列基础的奖励模型和生成性奖励模型的性能。

Result: 序列基础的奖励模型在此基准上的平均准确率仅为52.7%，而零样本语言模型判别为53.9%。相较之下，生成性奖励模型实现了81.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: 当前的RLHF方法主要学习检测客观错误，而不是捕捉主观质量偏好。成功的偏好建模可能需要中间推理表示，而不是直接分类。

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

Conclusion: 使用\textit{CodeSeq}进行训练的模型在多种推理任务上表现出色，并且能够保持模型在OOD（非分布数据集）上的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAIF-SPA enhances Text-To-Speech emotional expressiveness using AI feedback, yielding substantial improvements in accuracy and human-like quality over existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation behind this research is to overcome the limitations of existing Text-To-Speech systems that achieve near-human quality in neutral speech but lack emotional expressiveness. Current models often require costly emotion annotations or aim for indirect objectives, resulting in speech that is accurate yet emotionally flat.

Method: The paper introduces the RLAIF-SPA framework which utilizes Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. It integrates Automatic Speech Recognition and Large Language Model techniques to directly reward emotional expressiveness and intelligibility. It focuses on prosodic-emotional alignment across four dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone, alongside ensuring semantic accuracy.

Result: The proposed RLAIF-SPA framework shows a 26.1% reduction in Word Error Rate (WER), a 9.1% increase in similarity to human-like expression (SIM-O), and over 10% improvement in human evaluation compared to models like Chat-TTS.

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA outperforms existing models such as Chat-TTS in key metrics, achieving improvements in word error rate reduction, increased similarity scores, and human evaluation measures, particularly in emotional expressiveness and intelligibility.

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前许多方法依赖于昂贵且透明度有限的商业LLM，并且通常需要事先知道簇的数量，而这在现实中并不总是可能的。

Method: 我们首先要求LLM为每个文本生成伪标签，然后在伪标签集合中对每个文本进行多标签分类。这种方法假设属于同一簇的文本会共享更多标签，在编码为嵌入时会更接近。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，所提出的方法可以在资源有限的场景中应用，并且在多个模型和数据集上具有稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了传统机器翻译模型在处理语义韵律上的不足，并提出了一种方法通过对特定结构的语义韵律进行训练来提高翻译准确性，尤其是中文“被”字句的消极语义韵律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于字面翻译的单词可能具有不同的语义韵律，现有机器翻译模型难以解决这一问题。为了弥补这一差距，论文提出了一种方法来教授机器翻译模型特定结构的语义韵律。

Method: 研究者创建了一个英文-中文句子对的数据集以展示“被”字句的消极语义韵律，并使用该数据集对OPUS-MT、NLLB-600M和mBART50模型进行微调。

Result: 微调后的翻译模型在处理中文“被”字句的消极语义韵律方面表现优异，并能够避免在翻译中性和有利内容时使用“被”字句。这一语义韵律知识还成功转移到了其他语言对的翻译中。

Conclusion: 微调后的机器翻译模型在使用“被”字句来翻译不利内容时表现更好，并能避免在翻译中性和有利内容时使用它。还发现，语义韵律知识可以在多语种模型中从英语-中文翻译迁移到其他语言对，如西班牙语-中文。

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出通过以人为本的讲故事框架，促进对AI潜在影响的全面思考，丰富了用户对风险类型的认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI快速发展带来许多应用工具，但由于脱离现实环境，可能会引入偏见、隐私泄露和不平等获取等风险，因此需要一种新方法平衡风险和益处。

Method: 提出了一种以人为本的框架，通过生成用户故事和多主体讨论，帮助人们在部署前考虑潜在的好处和危害。

Result: 通过用户研究，参与故事阅读的小组能够识别更广泛的潜在危害类型，其响应分布较为均匀，而没有阅读故事的组则主要关注于隐私和福祉。

Conclusion: 讲故事的方式能够促进对AI可能影响的全面理解，同时提高创造性思维。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合过程级监督的自动评分机制，用于改善多模态推理中的强化学习，显著提高了性能和推理可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）已迅速从感知任务发展到复杂的多步推理，但使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）往往会导致虚假的推理，因为只有最终答案正确性得到了奖励。

Method: 我们提出了一种可扩展的自我聚合方法，通过从成功的推理路径中提取一致的推理检查点，以生成针对特定问题的评分标准，未使用人工标注或更强大的教师模型。并将评分标准奖励与结果奖励联合使用。

Result: AutoRubric-R1V在六项多模态推理基准测试中达到了最佳表现，并在专用评估中显著提高了推理的可信度。

Conclusion: 我们提出的AutoRubric-R1V框架显著提升了多模态推理的性能和推理的可信度。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

TL;DR: Pluto 框架用于评估 LLM 生成的 Verilog 设计的综合效率，包含 114 个问题的评估集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估综合指标时存在不足，无法全面评估 LLM 生成的 Verilog 设计的效率，缺乏优化基线或验证的测试板，为此，研究者开发了 Pluto 框架。

Method: Pluto 提供了一个评估集，包括 114 个具有自检测试框架的问题，及多个帕累托最优的参考实现，用于评估 LLM 生成设计的效率。

Result: Pluto 是一种基准测试和评估框架，针对大语言模型（LLMs）生成的 Verilog 设计的效率进行评估，解决了现有基准测试在综合指标（如面积、延迟和功耗）上不足的问题。

Conclusion: 实验结果显示，虽然最先进的大语言模型在功能正确性上表现良好，但在合成效率方面仍然不如专家工艺实现，强调了像 Pluto 这样的效率感知评估框架的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights
the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive
progress in hardware-focused LLM research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在创意写作中表现出系统性缺陷，尤其是在训练数据稀缺且缺乏过程级监督的非英语环境中。

Method: 提出COIG-Writer，一个中文创意写作数据集，通过系统地逆向工程高质量文本来捕获多样化的输出及其潜在的思维过程。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：过程监督是高度有效的，但需要用一般数据来稳定。创意能力具有文化约束，无法跨语言转移；词汇多样性与创意质量成反比（TTR悖论）。

Conclusion: 创意写作的卓越表现源于逻辑架构与语言基础的相互作用，类似于数学推理在基础模型中增强而不能替代语言能力。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Conclusion: 使用答案再生框架能够提高推理模型的性能和鲁棒性，提供更可靠的模型评估结果。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种不依赖外部数据的在线测试时间框架，通过自监督优化MoE模型的路由决策，增强推理任务性能和上下文变化的鲁棒性，实验表明性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过稀疏专家激活实现了高效扩展，但在部署过程中由于分布偏移常导致次优路由决策。现有的测试时间适应方法主要针对密集模型且需要外部数据，不适用于MoE架构。因此，需要一种无需外部数据和监督的自适应路由方法。

Method: 该方法利用自监督机制对已经生成的序列进行优化，在预填充阶段和之后的定期间隔时，调整模型的路由决策。通过轻量级的加性向量，仅更新选定层的路由器logits，从而在维持计算效率的同时防止过度调整。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在处理复杂推理任务时性能提升显著，如在HumanEval测试中，使用OLMoE模型提高了5.5%的表现。同时，该方法与已有的测试时间扩展技术兼容，如结合自一致性方法在DeepSeek-V2-Lite上平均性能提升6%。

Conclusion: 提出了一种数据无关的在线测试时间框架，可以在不依赖外部数据的情况下，对MoE模型的路由决策进行持续调整，提高了执行复杂推理任务时的性能和对上下文变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Midtraining, especially early on and in domains like math and code, improves language model performance by reducing forgetting and aligning better with posttraining data compared to continued pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and understand the effectiveness of the midtraining phase in language model training, which is not well-understood despite its popularity.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with language models pretrained from scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets across different domains, including ablations on the starting time and mixture weights of the midtraining phase.

Result: Midtraining is most effective in reducing the syntactic gap in math and code domains, outperforming continued pretraining in in-domain validation loss and reducing pretraining data forgetting. Timing of midtraining has a greater impact than mixture weights, with earlier midtraining yielding better results.

Conclusion: Midtraining is an effective domain adaptation technique that reduces forgetting and improves performance compared to continued pretraining, particularly in domains like math and code.

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

TL;DR: MLIR-AIR是一种新型编译器栈，能够有效地将高层次工作负载映射到具有空间架构的硬件上，实现了高效的计算和简化的代码表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现代计算架构对数据移动、执行顺序和计算部署的精细控制需求，传统编译器无法有效应对。因此，需要提供明确的机制来调整计算和数据，充分发挥现代空间架构的性能。

Method: 引入了基于MLIR的开源编译器栈MLIR-AIR，定义了AIR方言，为异步和分层操作提供结构化表示。通过两个案例研究展示了其能力，分别是矩阵乘法和LLaMA 2模型中的多头注意力块。

Result: 在矩阵乘法中，MLIR-AIR达到了接近78.7%的计算效率，与使用低级MLIR-AIE框架手动优化的实现性能几乎相同。在多头注意力块中，展示了AIR接口支持大约150行代码的融合实现，能够高效映射到空间硬件上。

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR实现了高效率的计算操作，同时简化了复杂工作负载的表述，有效地将高层次结构化控制流转化为空间程序，充分利用NPU的计算和内存结构。

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成系统（RAG）利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成基于检索上下文的准确可靠回复，但这些模型在处理语义等效输入时常表现出一致性不足的问题。这种情况是由于缺乏关注一致性训练数据和现有微调技术提升输出一致性的限制所导致的。

Conclusion: 合并后的模型为提高工业RAG系统的可靠性提供了实用的解决方案，有望增强输出的一致性和准确性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

Motivation: 传统的缩放定律未能捕捉下游任务的性能，而上下文在下游任务中扮演关键角色。因此，研究人员希望提出一个可以建模下游性能的框架，以更好地理解上下文和训练计算之间的关系。

Method: 研究人员提出了一种简单可解释的框架，将下游性能建模为训练计算和提供上下文的函数，并通过对Llama-2-7B和Llama-2-13B的扩展上下文变体在三个任务上的下游性能进行拟合来验证这一框架。

Result: 研究结果表明，该框架能够准确模拟分布内的下游性能，且能在训练计算量上泛化，从而能够可靠地推断出随着上下文增加的性能变化情况。

Conclusion: 研究表明，所提出的框架可以准确建模分布内的下游性能，在训练计算量上跨多个数量级进行泛化，并在上下文增加时可靠推断性能。这为设计更高效的长上下文大语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient
long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 精神健康障碍在全球范围内是导致残疾的主要原因之一，但由于主观评估、临床资源有限、污名和意识不足，抑郁症、焦虑症和PTSD等疾病常被误诊或漏诊。

Method: 研究采用了多个模型类别，包括利用GPT-4.1 Mini和MetaLLaMA进行的零样本提示，以及通过LowRank Adaptation (LoRA)进行微调的RoBERTa模型。评估了这些模型在精神健康筛查中的有效性。

Result: 研究中的机器学习模型在各诊断类别中准确率超过80%，在PTSD检测中表现尤为出色（准确率高达89%，召回率为98%）。此外，使用更短、更集中的上下文可以提高召回率。

Conclusion: 基于大型语言模型的机器学习模型在精神健康筛查方面表现出色，特别是在PTSD的检测上。这些模型能在资源有限或污名化严重的环境中，为早期诊断提供可行的低门槛解决方案。

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前的做法要求LLM使用两个单独的提示模板顺序生成解决方案和自验证，这显着降低了效率。

Method: 我们提出了LaSeR算法，通过在原始RLVR损失中增强MSE损失，将最后一个令牌的自奖励分数与验证器推理奖励对齐，联合优化LLM的推理和自奖励能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，我们的方法不仅提高了模型的推理性能，还使其具备了显著的自奖励能力，从而增强了其推断时的扩展性能。

Conclusion: 我们的算法不仅提升了模型的推理性能，还使其具备了显着的自奖励能力，从而提高了推断时的扩展性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaBench首次提供了一个用于代谢组学评估的基准，揭示了大语言模型在文本生成上表现出色，但在跨数据库对接和对稀疏数据处理上仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于大语言模型在需要深入且互联的科学领域知识方面的表现尚不明确，研究者希望通过系统评价来了解其在代谢组学领域的能力。

Method: 作者引入了MetaBench，这是第一个用于评估代谢组学领域能力的基准，评估五种对代谢组学研究至关重要的能力：知识、理解、对接、推理和研究。

Result: 研究评估了25种开源和闭源大型语言模型在代谢组学任务中的表现，发现模型在文本生成任务中表现良好，但在跨数据库标识符对接和稀疏注释的长尾代谢物上表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究表明：虽然大语言模型在一般文本生成任务中表现出色，但在代谢组学任务中，尤其是在跨数据库标识符对接方面表现仍有不足。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on
general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that
require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized.
Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways,
heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically
evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first
benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public
resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics
research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our
evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance
patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text
generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even
with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail
metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential
infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling
systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics
research.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 编码大模型中的子词标记器依赖统计而非语法，导致标记化不一致。引入TokDrift框架，发现格式变化显著影响模型表现，强调需要语法感知的标记化进行改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了测量错误对齐的标记化对编码大模型产生的影响。

Method: 引入了TokDrift框架，应用语义保留的重写规则来创建仅在标记化上有所不同的代码变体，并对九个代码LLM进行了层次化分析。

Result: 即使是微小的格式变化也会导致模型行为的显著变化，尤其在早期嵌入中，子词分段未能捕捉语法标记边界。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了编码大模型中错误对齐的标记化是可靠的代码理解和生成的隐性障碍，强调了未来编码LLM需要具有语法感知的标记化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了STDW方法，通过动态加权机制改善逐步域适应中的稳健性，实验结果优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过解决从源域到目标域的平滑知识迁移挑战，提高逐步域适应中的稳健性。传统方法在中间域的知识迁移效率或数据完整性上存在不足。

Method: 该方法引入了一种动态加权机制，采用自训练生成伪标签，并优化加权目标函数进行迭代模型更新。STDW设计的优化框架通过时间变化的超参数\(\varrho\)控制域特定学习的强度。

Result: 在旋转MNIST、颜色偏移MNIST、肖像数据集和Cover Type数据集上的实验表明，STDW优于现有基线。消融研究验证\(\varrho\)的动态调度在实现渐进适应中的关键作用。

Conclusion: STDW方法在逐步域适应中表现出显著优于现有基线的方法。在动态的真实场景中表现出潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

TL;DR: 引入了整合对抗性训练的新框架，在提高生成稳定性的同时增强分类鲁棒性，在生成保真度方面接近最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在单一框架内同时实现稳健分类和高保真生成建模的挑战，尤其是现有方法在SGLD基础上的不稳定性和样本质量问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练框架，将对抗性训练原则整合到判别和生成学习中，以提高分类鲁棒性和生成稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上的实验表明，这种方法在对抗性鲁棒性方面表现出色，同时在生成建模的优化上生成保真度超过BigGAN并接近扩散模型，尤其对复杂高分辨率数据集实现了高质量生成。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在解决现有混合模型的对抗性鲁棒性方面表现出显著改善，并在保持竞争性生成性能的同时显著提高对抗性鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: K-frames is a new method for keyframe selection in long videos, ensuring temporal continuity and allowing flexible multi-scale selection through a three-stage learning approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for keyframe selection often lead to sparse and temporally disjointed frames, which neglect scene continuity and lack flexibility for multi-scale frame selection.

Method: K-frames introduces a three-stage progressive curriculum learning. It uses two Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that optimizes the scene-driven prediction policy.

Result: Experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks show that K-frames is effective and interpretable for keyframe selection.

Conclusion: K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution for keyframe selection at various scales for long-video understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了多视图半监督LDL方法（MVSS-LDL），通过补充各视图的局部结构实现更好的分类性能，显著优于现有单视图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的大多数方法仅针对单视图的LDL问题，并且只考虑标记数据，而多视图结合标记和未标记数据的LDL问题尚未被考虑。

Method: 研究者提出了一种名为MVSS-LDL的方法，通过计算每个视图的局部最近邻结构，强调多视图局部最近邻结构的互补性。具体来说，首先通过计算k近邻来探索视图的局部结构。然后，在其他视图中补充样本的最近邻，从而获得更全面的描述。在此基础上，构建了一个基于图学习的多视图半监督LDL模型。

Result: 数值研究表明，MVSS-LDL在分类性能方面显著优于现有的单视图LDL方法。

Conclusion: MVSS-LDL在分类性能方面明显优于现有的单视图LDL方法。

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在多模态学习中，模态不平衡不仅存在于表示学习中，还明显体现在决策层，建议在决策层加入自适应权重分配机制以改善这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示多模态学习中模态不平衡的问题，尤其是了解这种不平衡在决策层的表现及其根源。

Method: 通过在音频和视觉数据集（CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds）上的实验，分析多模态学习中存在的模态不平衡问题，并检测决策层的偏差来源。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使经过广泛的预训练和平衡优化，模型仍表现出对某些模态的系统性偏见。这种偏见来自于特征空间和决策权重分布的固有差异，而不仅仅是由优化动态引起的。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，在多模态学习中，存在于特征空间和决策层的固有分歧，而不仅仅是优化动态过程，导致系统性地偏向某些模态。

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight Weaving improves model merging without evaluation data, enhancing accuracy significantly across different tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of principled data-free approaches for setting scaling hyper-parameters ($\lambda$) in model merging, avoiding the impractical use of privileged evaluation data for tuning.

Method: Weight Weaving pools model weights using user-defined pooling functions like averaging or random selection across scaling hyper-parameter search spaces, compatible with existing model merging methods and eliminating the need for evaluation data.

Result: The Weight Weaving method shows significant improvements in accuracy, up to 15.9 percentage points, in data-free scenarios across various ViT variant experimental setups (vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and domain generalization).

Conclusion: Weight Weaving method consistently improves the performance of several model merging methods by integrating model weights across a range of scaling hyper-parameters without needing evaluation data, achieving substantial accuracy gains in data-free settings.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的ICD编码自动化方法普遍忽略了代码顺序对诊断和报销的重要性，因此需要考虑编码顺序的方法来提高准确性。

Method: 首次尝试从检索系统的角度，将ICD编码任务视为分类与排序任务结合的问题。

Result: 提出的模型在主要诊断代码排名准确度上达到47%，相比之下，最新的分类器仅为20%。此外，在分类评估指标上，模型的微平均F1分数为0.6065，宏平均F1分数为0.2904，超过了先前最佳模型的0.597和0.2660。

Conclusion: 研究表明，提出的框架在识别高优先级代码方面优于其他方法，在ICD编码排序准确性和分类指标上都表现出了更好的性能。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

TL;DR: 本文引入了一种新的数据一致性损失（DC损失），以取代传统的点对点匹配损失，通过统计一致性来提高信号恢复的效果。DC损失在许多实际的逆问题中表现出优越的效果，例如图像去噪和医学图像重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的解决方案在真实信号的先验假设（正则化）和与噪声测量数据的一致性之间进行平衡。常规数据保真损失函数往往导致对噪声的过拟合，本文提出通过统计一致性来克服这一问题。

Method: 本文采用了一种新的数据一致性损失（DC损失），该方法通过使用基于模型的概率得分，进行分布层次的校准代替传统的点对点数据匹配。

Result: 使用DC损失相较于传统损失，如MSE损失，在逆问题中显示了优越的性能。在图像去噪中，使用DC损失无需提前停止并获得更高的PSNR；在医学图像重建中，DC损失减少了伪影并增强了手工设计正则化的效果。

Conclusion: DC损失提供了一种统计基础的方法来增强传统数据保真损失的性能，适用于许多逆问题，特别是在图像去噪和医学图像重建领域。

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

TL;DR: BitDistill compresses full-precision LLMs to 1.58-bit precision, maintaining performance while drastically reducing memory and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to achieve efficient task-specific performance of large language models with minimal computational cost and resource usage, specifically aiming to compress models to 1.58-bit precision while retaining their effectiveness.

Method: The paper presents a distillation pipeline that utilizes three techniques: the SubLN module from BitNet, multi-head attention distillation from MiniLM, and continual pre-training to address the performance gap during the fine-tuning process.

Result: The experimental results demonstrate that BitDistill retains comparable performance to full-precision models while providing significant benefits in memory usage and inference speed, with up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Conclusion: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) effectively fine-tunes full-precision large language models into 1.58-bit precision, maintaining strong task-specific performance with reduced computational resource requirements.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

Motivation: CSCNNs的核基的不完整性限制了模型的表达能力，研究旨在提升其表现力以更好地解决复杂预测任务。

Method: 通过引入条件性的Clifford-Steerable核，利用输入特征场计算等变表示，并通过隐式参数化高效解决等变约束。

Result: 该方法在流体动力学和相对论电动力学等多个偏微分方程预测任务中表现优越，均超过了基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种条件性的Clifford-Steerable核来解决CSCNNs的核基不完整性问题，从而提升模型表达能力。

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: 通过这个基准，我们评估了代表性的因果表示学习方法，并提供了实证见解，帮助实践者和新手选择或扩展适当的CRL框架。

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TENDE is a novel method using diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy accurately and robustly, overcoming limitations of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods of estimating transfer entropy face issues like the curse of dimensionality, restrictive assumptions, and the need for large datasets, prompting the development of an improved method.

Method: The authors propose TENDE (Transfer Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a method that uses score-based diffusion models for estimating transfer entropy via conditional mutual information.

Result: TENDE provides flexible and scalable estimation with minimal assumptions about the data-generating process, achieving better accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: TENDE exhibits superior accuracy and robustness over current neural estimators and state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Motivation: 传统的模型合并方法在处理低秩表示的模型时，通常会导致合并模型性能严重下降。因此，提出一种新的能够保留单个任务模型性能的合并方法是必要的。

Method: RMM通过构建一个紧凑的模型基础，使得原始任务模型可以通过线性组合恢复，并且该方法通过封闭形式的解决方案来选择最优的模型权重基和任务系数。

Result: 实验表明，RMM方法在不同数据集和模型规模上均优于现有的合并方法，并显著保留了低秩压缩模型的性能。

Conclusion: RMM能够有效地将多任务模型合并，并且在不影响模型压缩性能的情况下，提供了一种新的模型合并框架。

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

Motivation: The study aims to bridge the performance gap between open-weight models and proprietary models in competitive programming benchmarks like the IOI, promoting transparency and reproducibility in evaluating LLMs.

Method: The paper introduces GenCluster, a test-time compute framework that uses large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy to explore diverse solution spaces efficiently.

Result: GenCluster scales effectively with available compute resources and can achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 using the open-weight model gpt-oss-120b, affirming its capability to perform at a high level.

Conclusion: GenCluster successfully achieves IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models, demonstrating that open models can compete with proprietary systems when efficient exploration of solution spaces is implemented.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

Conclusion: 通过CAST方法，我们能得出更多关于编码器和解码器模型行为的见解，如解码器模型呈现压缩-扩展周期，而编码器模型则保持一致的高秩处理。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据相似性的非参数归属方法，避免了梯度访问，取得了与梯度方法相近的效果并优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型归属方法通常需要访问模型梯度或重新训练，这在专有或大规模环境中应用受限。为此，我们提出了一种无需访问模型梯度和重新训练的归属方法。

Method: 我们提出了一种非参数的归属方法，该方法完全基于数据进行操作，通过生成和训练图像之间的局部相似性来度量影响力。此方法基于最优评分函数的解析形式，并自然地延伸到多尺度表示，同时通过基于卷积的加速技术实现计算效率。

Conclusion: 我们的方法能够在不需访问模型梯度和不重新训练的情况下实现有效的数据归属，同时展现了在不同尺度上对训练数据与生成输出影像之间关系的洞察力。实验结果显示，该方法在数据归属性能上达到了与梯度方法相近的水平，并明显优于现有的非参数基线。

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

TL;DR: 引入CAREBench来评估早期的事件预测模型的部署能力，特别是风险轨迹的准确性和稳定性存在不足，需开发更稳定的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基准忽略了风险评分的稳定性，并且主要依赖于表格输入来评估，未测试轨迹行为的稳定性。这导致了需要新的基准来评估这些系统的实际可部署性和稳定性。

Method: 提出了一个稳定性度量，可量化每位患者风险的短期变化，并依据局部Lipschitz常数对突然的波动进行惩罚。CAREBench横跨六项预测任务，例如脓毒症的发病，比较经典学习器、深序列模型和零样本大语言模型，以评估其部署能力。

Result: 现有方法，特别是大语言模型，在同时优化准确性和稳定性方面表现不佳，尤其是在高精度操作点的召回率明显较低。

Conclusion: 现有的模型在同时优化预测准确性和风险轨迹的时间稳定性方面存在困难，特别是在高精度操作点的召回率还较低。需要开发能够生成与证据一致且稳定的风险轨迹的模型，以在持续监测环境中赢得临床医生的信任。

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SR-RC, combining spectral residual methods with reservoir computing to improve real-time anomaly detection on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve anomaly detection performance of RC without compromising learning efficiency, especially on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Proposed a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) model that combines the spectral residual (SR) method with reservoir computing to enhance anomaly detection.

Result: SR-RC demonstrated superior anomaly detection performance compared to traditional RC and logistic-regression models on benchmark and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SR-RC outperforms conventional RC and logistic-regression models, offering a practical solution for Edge AI deployment in time-series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 引入一种新的强化学习方法，通过减少不确定性来提高样本效率和策略价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在强化学习中测量状态可能代价高昂，并对未来结果产生负面影响，因此需要一种能够在选择控制动作的同时决定是否测量潜在状态的办法。

Method: 提出一种新的强化学习算法，称为主动可观察马尔可夫决策过程（AOMDP），并使用线上强化学习算法和序贯蒙特卡洛方法来近似信念状态。

Result: 我们证明减少不确定性可能在这些代价下显著提高样本效率，并增加最优策略的价值。

Conclusion: AOMDP可以有效降低测量状态的不确定性，提高样本效率，并通过数字健康应用验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LLM-ERM框架，通过语言模型引导的搜索方法，在需要少量样本的情况下，解决短程序学习的问题，且比传统梯度方法更具统计效率和计算可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找一种既样本高效又计算可行的程序学习算法，以解决经典算法在短程序上的搜索成本高以及梯度训练在某些情况下需大量样本的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为LLM-ERM的框架，通过预训练的增强推理语言模型来引导候选程序的搜索，并在数据中编译和验证每个候选程序，最后返回最佳验证假设。

Result: LLM-ERM在如奇偶校验、模式匹配和素性测试等任务中，仅需200个样本即可解决问题，而SGD训练的变压器即使有100,000个样本也会过拟合。

Conclusion: 基于语言模型引导的程序学习能够在保持计算可行性的同时，恢复基于ERM的统计效率，为学习超出梯度训练能力的简洁假设提供了一条实用途径。

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTS-GT introduces a novel approach for Graph Transformers, balancing performance with interpretability, by using asymmetric attention and depth-wise heterogeneity in GNN selection. It provides state-of-the-art results and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of current Graph Transformers, which use fixed GNN types across layers, lack quantifiable interpretability, and have complex architectures that obscure performance gains.

Method: The method involves redesigning Graph Transformer (GT) attention through asymmetry and decoupling structural encoding from feature representation. It employs Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at each layer, introducing depth-wise heterogeneity. It also develops a quantitative interpretability framework for GTs using causal ablation with metrics like Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus.

Result: DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four out of eight benchmark datasets while remaining competitive on others. It provides more interpretable models than baselines, revealing that commonly used visualization techniques may not capture the components that actually matter.

Conclusion: DARTS-GT establishes that Graph Transformers can achieve both high performance and interpretability without compromising one for the other.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的停止策略Stop-RAG，通过适应性地决定何时停止检索，提高了RAG在多跳问题回答中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在每次迭代中，引入新证据信息会增加复杂多跳问答的延迟和成本，因此需要一个高效的停止策略来优化检索过程。

Method: 将迭代RAG转化为一个有限视界马尔可夫决策过程，引入了基于价值的控制器Stop-RAG，它通过全宽度前向视图Q(λ)目标进行训练，从而自适应地决定何时停止检索。

Result: Stop-RAG在多跳问答基准上表现优于固定迭代基线和基于提示的LLM停止方法。

Conclusion: Stop-RAG有效地改进了RAG系统的停止策略，提高了多跳问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

Conclusion: MergeMoE方法通过数学优化构建压缩矩阵，并在多个MoE模型上的压缩性能优于基线。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，在大型语言模型的剪枝后，重建具有较大的重要性和潜力，并且能以更低的资源消耗获得优于完全重训的性能。

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Result: 手动梯度下降实现达到了92.59%的平均测试准确性，而scikit-learn实现则有24倍的训练速度提升和98.15%的准确率。L1正则化实现了54-69%的特征减少，只带来了4.63%的准确性下降。

Conclusion: 论文探讨了一种在化学分析中进行高效、多类别葡萄酒分类的方法，验证了不同算法在准确性、特征稀疏性及可解释性上的权衡。

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的数据选择和权重调整框架ICA，可提高模型性能，无需高昂计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在选择高价值的训练数据方面，很多方法依赖于启发式或代价高昂的再训练，因此需要探索系统且高效的选择方法。

Method: 提出了一种称为In-Context Approximation (ICA) 的方法，通过对候选样本在小样本持出集上的损失进行估计，不需要参考模型或额外的微调，从而为每个样本分配权重。

Result: ICA方法在不同任务和数据集上的重加权能一致地改进模型的对齐性能，且对计算资源需求较低。

Conclusion: 提出了一种理论上有基础的资源高效的数据选择和重加权框架ICA，通过动态调整样本权重，能在多个任务和数据集上提高模型的对齐性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess2Graph 框架通过使用专家猜测引导统计测试，提高因果发现性能，确保在有限样本中仍能保持正确性和性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有限样本条件下表现不佳，整合专家知识有望改善性能，但需完美预测或不确定性估计，使其在实际使用中不可靠。

Method: 提出了 Guess2Graph (G2G) 框架，并开发了 PC-Guess 和 gPC-Guess 两个具体实现，通过引导统计测试序列来增强因果发现性能。

Result: 在理论上，PC-Guess 和 gPC-Guess 均能在保持正确性的同时提升性能，特别是当专家猜测优于随机时，gPC-Guess 在有限样本中显著优于未增强版本。

Conclusion: Guess2Graph (G2G) 框架通过利用专家猜测来引导统计测试的顺序，而不是取代它们，从而在保持统计一致性的同时提高性能。

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

TL;DR: 研究提出了SRSNet和SRS模块，通过选择性patching和动态重组增强时间序列预测性能，并在多个领域的数据集上实现了领先的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的patching方法将时间序列划分为相邻的patch，导致固定的表示空间，从而表示能力不足。因此本文探索了构建一个选择性的表示空间，灵活地包含最具信息量的patch进行预测。

Method: 本文提出了Selective Representation Space (SRS)模块，利用可学习的选择性patching和动态重组技术，选择并重新排列来自上下文时间序列的patch，以充分利用这些信息来增强基于patch的模型的预测性能。还实现了一个简单但有效的SRSNet，由SRS模块和MLP头组成。

Conclusion: 提出的SRSNet模型及SRS模块在多个领域的真实数据集上展示了卓越的预测性能，并且可以作为插件提升现有基于patch的模型性能。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种基于先验预测矩匹配的方法来确定概率张量模型中秩的可辨识性，并为识别出的模型推导出了显式封闭形式的秩估计量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在张量分解中选择潜在维度（秩）是一个重要且具有挑战性的任务，该过程通常依赖于启发式方法。

Method: 将矩匹配条件转化为一个关于边缘矩、先验超参数和秩的对数线性方程组。

Result: 对于PARAFAC/CP、Tensor Train和Tensor Ring模型，推导出基于观测数据矩的显式封闭形式的秩估计量，并通过实验验证了这些估计量，评估了方法的稳健性。

Conclusion: 对于PARAFAC/CP模型、Tensor Train模型和Tensor Ring模型，其线性、链式和闭环结构使得方程组可解，从而使秩是可辨识的。而Tucker模型的对称拓扑结构导致方程组欠定，使得秩不可辨识。

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MX+ enhances block floating-point (BFP) formats to handle outliers more effectively, leading to better large language model performance with little additional cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ultra low-bit block floating-point (BFP) variants struggle with performance due to outlier values, necessitating an effective method to address this issue for efficient LLM serving.

Method: The paper proposes MX+, an extension of microscaling (MX) formats that repurposes the exponent field of outlier elements as an extended mantissa to enhance precision.

Result: MX+ achieves substantially higher model performance than the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4), with minimal storage and performance overhead.

Conclusion: MX+ offers a compelling alternative to existing formats by efficiently handling outliers in reduced-precision data, achieving higher model performance with minimal storage and performance overhead.

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决训练和测试数据之间的分布差异带来的模型预测不准确问题，特别是在图结构中由于结构冗余导致的语义偏移。

Method: 提出了一种名为RedOUT的无监督框架，通过将结构熵集成到测试时的图分类OOD检测中。

Result: 实验结果表明，RedOUT在OOD检测任务中表现出色，在ClinTox/LIPO数据集上的平均提升达到了6.7%，并且显著超过最佳竞争对手17.3%。

Conclusion: RedOUT通过最小化结构熵有效减少冗余，并提出了优化的理论上下界，使得OOD检测在真实数据集上获得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Conformal Labeling to improve AI label trustworthiness by controlling false discovery rate, providing theoretical guarantees and demonstrating effective performance in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to improve the quality of AI-predicted labels while maintaining cost-effectiveness in labeling large datasets.

Method: The method constructs conformal p-values by comparing AI models' predicted confidence with calibration instances mislabeled by AI models, selecting instances with p-values below a threshold.

Result: Achieved tight false discovery rate control with high power in experiments across various tasks.

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling is effective in controlling the false discovery rate, ensuring a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Motivation: 结构为基础的药物设计中，精确预测蛋白质-配体结合姿态至关重要。然而，现有方法在速度、精确性和物理合理性上难以取得平衡。

Method: Matcha由三个连续阶段组成，每个阶段都是在适当的几何空间（$\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$和$\mathrm{SO}(2)$）上运行的流匹配模型。该方法通过专门的评分模型提升预测质量，并利用无监督的物理有效性过滤器消除不切实际的姿势。

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为Matcha的新型分子对接管道，通过组合多阶段流匹配、学习得分和物理有效性过滤，成功提高了蛋白质-配体结合的预测精度，并且在速度上也有显著提升。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

TL;DR: MAHA presents a novel approach for multimodal retrieval in RAG systems, outperforming existing methods with its modality-aware architecture, and achieving a notable ROUGE-L score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the capability of RAG systems in processing unstructured multimodal documents by introducing a modality-aware architecture that integrates multiple types of data.

Method: MAHA combines dense vector retrieval with modality-aware knowledge graph traversal, encoding cross-modal semantics for effective retrieval across different data formats.

Result: MAHA achieves a high ROUGE-L score of 0.486, outclassing current baseline methods and demonstrating complete modality coverage in retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: MAHA significantly outperforms baseline methods in multimodal question answering, proven by its high ROUGE-L score and comprehensive modality coverage, demonstrating its capability in effectively retrieving information from unstructured multimodal data.

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

TL;DR: FAL and FAL+ architectures offer efficient transformer models by bypassing MHA-MLP connections, reducing communication overhead, and enhancing model quality, leading to significant improvements in training time and throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to reduce the communication overhead in distributed multi-GPU settings, particularly involving tensor parallelism in transformer models, to improve efficiency and model quality.

Method: FAL architecture bypasses MHA-MLP connections by redirecting the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of subsequent layers, eliminating all-reduce communication. FAL+ enhances this by adding the normalized first attention output to subsequent MLP inputs.

Result: The FAL architecture reduces multilayer GPU training time by up to 44% and improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x. FAL+ provides even lower perplexity without increasing training time compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: FAL and FAL+ architectures provide significant improvements in training time, throughput, and model quality compared to traditional transformer designs.

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

Conclusion: LeapFactual提供可靠的反事实解释，可以作为新的训练数据提升模型性能，广泛适用于多个领域。

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The GeoAdapt method improves unsupervised domain adaptation by using Riemannian distance and SPD matrices for better alignment of source and target distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address distribution shift in unsupervised domain adaptation by improving the alignment of source and target distributions through a principled geometric approach.

Method: The method involves aligning statistical moments using Riemannian distance, leveraging SPD matrices through Siegel embeddings to maintain the intrinsic geometry of the distributions.

Result: The paper proposes a new method called GeoAdapt for unsupervised domain adaptation. This method uses a Riemannian distance to align statistical moments of source and target distributions. By expressing moments as a symmetric positive definite matrix through Siegel embeddings, the method preserves the geometric structure of distributions, providing a better metric for cross-domain comparison.

Conclusion: The GeoAdapt method provides a more accurate metric for aligning statistical moments of source and target distributions, improving performance in unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

Motivation: 传统的联邦学习在处理非独立同分布数据和客户的计算资源异质性时存在困难，个性化的联邦学习方法虽能解决这些问题，但往往忽视了模型和数据异质性共存的问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为FedPPA的新方法，通过渐进的参数对齐来逐步调整客户和全局模型之间的公共层权重，同时结合基于熵的加权平均以提升全局模型性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedPPA在三个图像分类数据集上表现优于现有的联邦学习算法，在个性化适应方面取得了更高的性能。

Conclusion: FedPPA方法有效缓解了非独立同分布环境下全局与本地模型的更新不一致问题，同时保留了客户的本地知识，增强了个性化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

Motivation: 加速大规模语言模型预训练中的批量大小增长策略是一种很有前景的方法，但对自适应优化器如Adam来说，如何选择最佳策略并不明确。

Method: 提出了Seesaw框架，在需要减半学习率时，改为调整为1/√2，同时批量大小加倍，以保持损失动力学，并减少序列步骤。在实践中应用于大规模模型，通过这种方法显著降低训练时间。

Result: Seesaw策略在Chinchilla规模模型上的使用显著减少了约36%的时钟时间，同时在等量FLOPs情况下，与余弦衰减相匹配。

Conclusion: Seesaw策略在理论上与学习率衰减相等，并在实践中减少了训练时间，证明其有效性。

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

TL;DR: Tawa自动编译器解决了GPU编程与硬件不匹配问题，通过新型抽象提高程序性能，实现NVIDIA GPU上显著的速度提升，简化编程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU的任务并行硬件与传统SIMT编程模型不匹配，导致编程困难且难以实现最高性能，因此需要一种自动化的方法来生成高性能的warp专用代码。

Method: Tawa使用了一种新型IR抽象异步引用(aref)，用于表达warp级别的通信，从而自动分割程序并管理数据流管道。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100 GPU上，Tawa在LLM内核中实现的硬件利用率高达1.1倍的速度提升；在注意力工作负载中，Tawa较Triton快1.2倍，并且性能达到手工优化的CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3内核水平。

Conclusion: Tawa自动化编译器有效解决了GPU编程模型与任务并行硬件不匹配的问题，通过warp专用代码优化，实现高效性能。

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

Motivation: 现有方法假设潜在混杂因素相互独立，或者无法正确处理具有观测变量因果关系的模型，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的算法，通过利用观测数据的高阶累积量来识别LvLiNGAM中的因果DAGs。

Conclusion: 该算法在模拟和真实数据实验中有效地识别了LvLiNGAM中的因果结构，其有效性和实用性得到了验证。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs
in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders (LvLiNGAM).
Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot
properly handle models with causal relationships among observed variables.
  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,
and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of
observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility
of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: PA-DST通过学习排列矩阵来提升结构化稀疏训练的表达能力，在高稀疏度下与非结构化基线相匹敌，同时提高训练和推断速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU上的结构化稀疏训练和推断速度很快，但在准确性上仍然落后于非结构化动态稀疏训练。原因为表达能力不足，即定块或N:M布局探索的可能性有限。

Method: 该论文提出了一种称为Permutation-Augmented Dynamic Sparse Training (PA-DST)的方法，在每一个层中同时学习一个排列矩阵和结构化权重矩阵，以提升结构化稀疏训练的表达能力。

Result: 在三个典型结构——块状结构、N:M结构和对角线结构上进行的实验表明，该方法在90-95%的稀疏度下能够在ImageNet-1K（ViT-B/16）和WikiText-103（GPT-2）上与非结构化基线（如RigL、SET）相匹敌，同时训练速度提高最多至1.21倍，推断速度提高最多至2.9倍。

Conclusion: 结构加上学习排列能够在准确性和效率之间找到平衡点，使得结构化稀疏训练在现代GPU上更具优势。

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

Method: 我们提出了一种软注意机制，从回顾和预测时间序列中寻找不变的模式，并引入一种方法无关的框架ShifTS以统一处理时间序列预测中的时序漂移和概念漂移。

Result: ShifTS能有效提升多种数据集上模型的预测准确性，并且超越现有的概念漂移、时序漂移及组合基线。

Conclusion: 通过引入ShifTS框架和软注意机制，本文在统一处理时序漂移和概念漂移方面取得了重要进展，并证明其有效能提升预测模型的准确性。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的后门去除方法，可以在不显著影响模型性能的情况下有效去除后门攻击，实现了优于现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的后门去除方法大多需要昂贵的微调过程，并且可能影响模型在其他任务上的表现。因此，本文旨在探索如何在不降低模型一般能力的情况下去除后门。

Method: 通过研究后门如何在模型权重空间中编码，发现后门与其他正常任务是可以分离的。这种拆分使得在不影响模型正常性能的情况下隔离并消除后门影响成为可能。基于此，我们引入了一种简单的反演学习方法，利用这种可以分离的特性进行后门去除。

Result: 实验结果表明，对于已知攻击类型的方法，该方法能实现近乎完美的后门去除，同时保留平均96%的模型准确度。此外，即使在攻击和攻击存在未知的情况下，通过对逆向工程触发器的正确估计，我们的方法也能成功去除后门。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种可以在不显著影响模型正常表现的前提下，移除模型中的后门攻击的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To predict learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from empirical measurements, particularly for kernel regression on real datasets.

Method: Hermite eigenstructure ansatz (HEA): an analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with respect to an anisotropic data distribution.

Result: Proved the HEA for Gaussian data, found it applicable to real image data, and empirically observed MLPs learning Hermite polynomials in the predicted order.

Conclusion: HEA框架为实现将数据集结构映射到模型性能的端到端学习理论提供了可能性，适用于非平凡学习算法在实际数据集上的应用。

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管后训练大语言模型与强化学习结合取得了广泛的成功，但目前的研究主要关注于在强化学习中出现但在基础模型中不存在的新颖行为。作者试图探讨是否可以通过纯采样而非额外训练来激发基础模型在推理时的类似能力。

Method: 受到马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）技术采样思想的启发，作者提出了一种利用基础模型自身似然性的简易迭代采样算法，在多个基础模型上进行测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，该算法在诸如MATH500、HumanEval和GPQA等广泛的单次任务上提供了显著的推理提升，几乎与甚至超过了使用强化学习取得的结果，同时避免了强化学习后训练中多次采样时多样性崩溃的问题。

Conclusion: 作者的方法无需训练、无需策划数据集或验证器，在多种推理任务中取得了优异的性能，展示了广泛的适用性，尤其是在难以验证的领域中。

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的扩散强制采样器，可以加速基于递归深度的语言模型的生成过程。这种方法在不需要任何调整的情况下能够应用于现有的模型，并显著提升生成速度。

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Katiana Kontolati,Rini Jasmine Gladstone,Ian Davis,Ethan Pickering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes BINNs which enhance genomic prediction by integrating multi-omics data during training. It achieves up to 56% improvement in accuracy and 75% reduction in prediction error, discovering nonlinear biological relations without needing all data during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional genotype-to-phenotype models are heavily dependent on direct mappings which achieve only modest accuracy, requiring costly field trials to improve genetic gain. The motivation is to create a more accurate and practical genomic prediction and selection model by integrating intermediate molecular phenotypes and prior biological knowledge.

Method: BINNs encode pathway-level inductive biases and leverage multi-omics data during training, but use genotype data alone during inference. This method correlates highly with experimental quantities, using synthetic metabolomics benchmarks and real-world data from maize gene-expression and multi-environment field trials.

Result: BINNs improve rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across subpopulations, and reduce prediction error by 75% in synthetic benchmarks compared to conventional neural networks. It also identifies nonlinear pathways and genes undetected by GWAS/TWAS, demonstrating biological relevance without being directly trained on certain data.

Conclusion: BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection, pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

Abstract: Delivering groceries or cleaning airports, mobile robots exist in public
spaces. While these examples showcase robots that execute tasks, this paper
explores mobile robots that encourage posthuman collaboration rather than
managing environments independently. With feigned fragility, cuteness and
incomplete functionalities, the so-called "weak robots" invite passersby to
engage not only on a utilitarian level, but also through imaginative and
emotional responses. After examining the workings of "weak robots" by queering
notions of function and ability, we introduce two speculative design fiction
vignettes that describe choreographies of such robots in future urban spaces --
one exploring a utopian weak robot and the other a dystopian weak robot. We
introduce these speculations in order to discuss how different values may drive
design decisions, and how such decisions may shape and drive different
socio-technical futures in which robots and humans share public spaces that
incentivise collaboration.

Motivation: The study seeks to explore the integration of GenAI into professional heritage practice to enhance the accessibility and efficiency of producing public-facing guidance documents.

Method: A GenAI chatbot named HAZEL was developed and fine-tuned to assist in revising written heritage conservation and interpretation guidance. Its performance was compared to ChatGPT (GPT-4) through quantitative assessments in various writing tasks.

Result: HAZEL showed slightly better performance than ChatGPT, indicating that fine-tuning the underlying LLM improves efficacy. Nevertheless, it displayed significant limitations in tasks requiring cultural sensitivity and advanced technical expertise.

Conclusion: GenAI, specifically the HAZEL chatbot, shows promise in enhancing heritage practice by improving accessibility to guidance documents, although it faces limitations in cultural sensitivity and technical expertise, implying it cannot fully replace human professionals.

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in
resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly utilizing large language model (LLM)based tools
for mental health guidance and crisis support in place of human experts. While
AI technology has great potential to improve health outcomes, insufficient
empirical evidence exists to suggest that AI technology can be deployed as a
clinical replacement; thus, there is an urgent need to assess and regulate such
tools. Regulatory efforts have been made and multiple evaluation frameworks
have been proposed, however,field-wide assessment metrics have yet to be
formally integrated. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive online
platform that aggregates evaluation approaches and serves as a dynamic online
resource to simplify LLM and LLM-based tool assessment: MindBenchAI. At its
core, MindBenchAI is designed to provide easily accessible/interpretable
information for diverse stakeholders (patients, clinicians, developers,
regulators, etc.). To create MindBenchAI, we built off our work developing
MINDapps.org to support informed decision-making around smartphone app use for
mental health, and expanded the technical MINDapps.org framework to encompass
novel large language model (LLM) functionalities through benchmarking
approaches. The MindBenchAI platform is designed as a partnership with the
National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) to provide assessment tools that
systematically evaluate LLMs and LLM-based tools with objective and transparent
criteria from a healthcare standpoint, assessing both profile (i.e. technical
features, privacy protections, and conversational style) and performance

precisely designed to accentuate memory, auditory interaction as well as haptic
response to visual signals with the use of music. Music is introduced as a key
component for establishing the game design that provides a source of meaningful

mechanics, which facilitated the construction of the serious game design
process. The discussion topics raised include the need to design serious games
for fostering meaningful interactions, as well as developing a thorough
framework for constructing purposeful design for serious games. A potential
integral of artificial intelligence to Puzzlegram may involve assigning a novel

in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to
understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods
to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by
applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled
human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle
accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques
such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator
data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and
how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings
illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally
optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for
quantitatively studying human cognition.

Motivation: 紧急避难所的前线员工面临替代性创伤、同情心疲劳和倦怠等挑战，而他们使用的技术往往没有针对其独特需求进行设计。本研究探讨了他们在某些情况下可能抵制自动化的原因及其背景。

Method: 该研究采用定性田野调查方法，从2022年至2024年在加拿大的一家大型应急收容所进行。研究的目标是共同设计、开发和部署一种互动数据导航界面。

Result: 通过该项研究，我们为理解管理收容所的数据在决策过程中的作用提供了洞见，揭示了员工不愿将关于弱势群体的决策外包给数据系统的原因。我们的发现提出了一种数据外包的连续体，并为如何设计技术支持富有同情心的数据驱动决策提供了建议。

Conclusion: 我们构建了一个互动数据导航界面，有助于应急庇护所的前线员工在做出关于无家可归者的协作、高风险决策时，能更好地利用数据，这有助于在非营利领域中创建支持同情心和数据驱动决策的技术。

Abstract: Frontline staff of emergency shelters face challenges such as vicarious
trauma, compassion fatigue, and burnout. The technology they use is often not
designed for their unique needs, and can feel burdensome on top of their
already cognitively and emotionally taxing work. While existing literature
focuses on data-driven technologies that automate or streamline frontline
decision-making about vulnerable individuals, we discuss scenarios in which
staff may resist such automation. We then suggest how data-driven technologies
can better align with their human-centred decision-making processes. This paper
presents findings from a qualitative fieldwork study conducted from 2022 to
2024 at a large emergency shelter in Canada. The goal of this fieldwork was to
co-design, develop, and deploy an interactive data-navigation interface that
supports frontline staff when making collaborative, high-stakes decisions about
individuals experiencing homelessness. By reflecting on this fieldwork, we
contribute insight into the role that administrative shelter data play during
decision-making, and unpack staff members' apparent reluctance to outsource
decisions about vulnerable individuals to data systems. Our findings suggest a
data-outsourcing continuum, which we discuss in terms of how designers may
create technologies to support compassionate, data-driven decision-making in
nonprofit domains.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了VisAider，一个利用AI辅助的交互式数据展示原型，通过分析实时演示环境来生成相关可视化建议。尽管初步测试揭示了一些挑战，但原型的可行性已得到验证，并正在继续开发以解决问题并进行全面用户研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的交互式可视化系统依赖于用户操作与可视化命令之间的固定映射，无法支持如更改可视化类型、调整数据转换或在实时演示中动态添加数据集等更丰富的操作。因此，需要开发能够分析实时演示情境并生成相关可视化建议的系统，以提升小组互动环境下的数据展示效果。

Method: 通过与经验丰富的数据分析师进行形式化研究，识别在实时适应视觉内容时的关键挑战，并提炼出指导系统开发的设计考虑因素。进行原型实现以展示在模拟场景中的方法可行性。

Result: 原型实现表明这种方法在模拟场景中是可行的。初步测试显示在数据转换推断、可视化任务的消除歧义和实现低延迟反应方面存在的挑战。

Conclusion: VisAider原型的初步测试揭示了在实时推断适当的数据转换、解决模糊的可视化任务和实现低延迟响应方面的挑战。正在进行的工作集中解决这些局限性，将系统集成到演示环境中，并准备一项总结性用户研究来评估可用性和交流影响。

Abstract: Effective real-time data presentation is essential in small-group interactive
contexts, where discussions evolve dynamically and presenters must adapt
visualizations to shifting audience interests. However, most existing
interactive visualization systems rely on fixed mappings between user actions
and visualization commands, limiting their ability to support richer operations
such as changing visualization types, adjusting data transformations, or
incorporating additional datasets on the fly during live presentations. This
work-in-progress paper presents VisAider, an AI-assisted interactive data
presentation prototype that continuously analyzes the live presentation
context, including the available dataset, active visualization, ongoing
conversation, and audience profile, to generate ranked suggestions for relevant
visualization aids. Grounded in a formative study with experienced data
analysts, we identified key challenges in adapting visual content in real time
and distilled design considerations to guide system development. A prototype
implementation demonstrates the feasibility of this approach in simulated
scenarios, and preliminary testing highlights challenges in inferring
appropriate data transformations, resolving ambiguous visualization tasks, and
achieving low-latency responsiveness. Ongoing work focuses on addressing these
limitations, integrating the system into presentation environments, and
preparing a summative user study to evaluate usability and communicative
impact.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TapNav, a prototype screen reader that combines audio and tactile feedback to help BLV users interact with touchscreen devices more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional audio-based screen readers for BLV users interacting with touchscreen devices.

Method: Evaluated TapNav with 12 BLV users interacting with data visualizations and a bank transactions app to gather qualitative findings.

Result: TapNav effectively used tactile overlays and adaptive auditory feedback to enhance spatial interaction with touchscreen interfaces for BLV users.

Conclusion: TapNav's spatiotactile approach helps BLV users in anticipating outcomes and offloading cognitive loads, resulting in faster exploration.

Abstract: Screen readers are audio-based software that Blind and Low Vision (BLV)
people use to interact with computing devices, such as tablets and smartphones.
Although this technology has significantly improved the accessibility of
touchscreen devices, the sequential nature of audio limits the bandwidth of
information users can receive and process. We introduce TapNav, an adaptive
spatiotactile screen reader prototype developed to interact with touchscreen
interfaces spatially. TapNav's screen reader provides adaptive auditory
feedback that, in combination with a tactile overlay, conveys spatial
information and location of interface elements on-screen. We evaluated TapNav
with 12 BLV users who interacted with TapNav to explore a data visualization
and interact with a bank transactions application. Our qualitative findings
show that touch points and spatially constrained navigation helped users
anticipate outcomes for faster exploration, and offload cognitive load to
touch. We provide design guidelines for creating tactile overlays for adaptive
spatiotactile screen readers and discuss their generalizability beyond our
exploratory data analysis and everyday application navigation scenarios.

Motivation: 研究音频在游戏自我调节中的潜力，推动在健康逃避游戏设计中的应用。

Method: 本文确定了音频在游戏中应用的的方法学和可访问性缺陷，并提出了解决这些不足的方法。

Result: 本文发现音频能够调节唤醒、标记过渡并提供闭合感，但其对福祉的贡献尚未得到充分研究。

Conclusion: 音频在游戏中的调节作用被低估，它对自我调节和健康逃避行为有重要影响。

Abstract: Escapism in games can support recovery or lead to harmful avoidance.
Self-regulation, understood as combining autonomy with positive outcomes, is
key to this distinction. We argue that audio, often overlooked, plays a central
role in regulation. It can modulate arousal, mark transitions, and provide
closure, yet its contribution to well-being remains underexplored. This paper
identifies methodological and accessibility gaps that limit recognition of
audio's potential and outlines ways to address them. We aim to encourage
researchers and developers to integrate audio more deliberately into the design
and study of healthier escapist play.

Conclusion: AI助手有效帮助用户保持专注，并使其数字行为与用户意图保持一致。

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead
to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological
and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention,
assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and
provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large
language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing
notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection
accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user
feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22
participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder
system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that
our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning
their digital behavior with their intentions. Our source code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在没有特定目标时常常产生千篇一律的结果。因此，研究的动机在于通过推断用户的即时目标来生成更具针对性的响应和工具。

Method: 提出了一种框架，用于通过被动观察用户行为来自动诱导即时目标，然后通过针对该目标的生成和评估来引导下游AI系统。

Result: 实验结果显示，即时目标使得LLM的输出在参与者任务中的胜率达66-86%，并且现场使用证明即时目标能生成针对每个参与者独有的专业化工具。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明通过推断用户即时目标，并迅速优化以实现该目标，大型语言模型（LLM）可以生成更具响应性和被期望的工具、界面和响应。

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

Motivation: 探索触摸增强现实（TAR）在将物理世界与数字世界整合以创造沉浸式互动体验中的应用潜力，特别是在对神经发育障碍（NDD）个体的治疗作用上。

Method: 本文探讨了两种TAR应用程序——Holomarket和Along the Oceanic Flow（ATOF），并通过两项探索性研究评估了它们在神经发育障碍个体中的可用性和喜好性。

Result: 参与者对真实的设置和触觉互动感到满意，尽管注意到在操控虚拟物品和长时间使用头戴设备时存在一些可用性挑战和不适。此外，虽然有部分参与者在与特定的虚拟元素交互时遇到困难，但整体反馈积极，应用显示了作为NDD治疗工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 尽管存在一些可用性挑战和硬件限制，参与者的正面反馈表明TAR在未来的治疗干预中可能发挥关键作用。需要进一步的研究来完善这些应用，提高用户的互动性和舒适度。

Abstract: Tangible Augmented Reality (TAR) is an interaction paradigm that integrates
physical and digital worlds to create immersive, interactive experiences. This
paper explores two TAR applications, Holomarket and Along the Oceanic Flow
(ATOF), and presents insights from two exploratory studies evaluating their
usability and likeability among individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDD). Holomarket is designed to simulate a supermarket shopping experience,
helping users develop essential life skills such as item selection, basic
arithmetic, and money handling. Participants interacted with augmented food
items and a smart cash register, navigating a virtual supermarket environment.
While participants enjoyed the realistic setting and tangible interactions,
some usability challenges, such as difficulty manipulating virtual objects and
discomfort with prolonged headset use, were noted. ATOF transforms the user
environment into an oceanic world, where participants use a dolphin-shaped
smart object to complete tasks like collecting items and solving puzzles. This
application aims to improve motor coordination and cognitive skills.
Participants appreciated the immersive experience, the customizable tasks, and
the tangible dolphin interface. However, some faced difficulties interacting
with specific virtual elements. Overall, both applications demonstrated
potential as therapeutic tools for NDD, offering engaging and immersive
experiences. Despite some usability challenges and hardware limitations, the
positive feedback suggests that TAR could play a crucial role in future
therapeutic interventions. Further research is needed to refine these
applications and enhance user interaction and comfort.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of virtual reality (VR) for enhancing
sales skills training using a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE). VR
technology enables users to practice interpersonal and negotiation skills in
controlled, immersive environments that mimic real-world scenarios. In this
study, participants engaged in sales simulations set in a virtual dealership,
interacting with avatars in different work settings and with various
communication styles. The research employed a within-subjects experimental
design involving 20 university students. Each participant experienced four
distinct sales scenarios randomized for environmental and customer conditions.
Training effectiveness was assessed using validated metrics alongside custom
experience questions. Findings revealed consistent user experience and presence
across all scenarios, with no significant differences detected based on
communication styles or environmental conditions. The study highlights the
advantages of semi-immersive VR systems for collaborative learning, peer

TL;DR: The paper explores how different game designs affect player experience in asymmetric multiplayer VR games, highlighting the impact of player dependency on usability, UX quality, immersion, and motivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of different game design approaches on player experience in asymmetric multiplayer VR games and address the risk of isolation due to the immersive nature of VR.

Method: The study involved creating and testing four different versions of a VR experience with 74 participants. Each version varied in terms of shared/separated virtual environments and mutual/unidirectional player dependency.

Result: The study found that variations in game design influenced system usability, pragmatic UX quality, immersion control, and intrinsic motivation. However, player roles and co-presence did not simultaneously impact these aspects, highlighting the importance of player dependency in the experience.

Conclusion: Variations in game design significantly affect aspects of the player experience in asymmetric multiplayer VR games, indicating that player dependency plays a crucial role in shaping these experiences.

Abstract: The risk of isolation in virtual reality (VR) stems from the immersive nature
of the technology. VR can transport users to entirely virtual environments,
often disconnecting them from the physical world and real-life interactions.
Asymmetric multiplayer options have been explored to address this issue and
encourage social interaction by requiring players to communicate and
collaborate to achieve common objectives. Nevertheless, research on
implementing these designs and their effects is limited, mainly due to the
novelty of multiplayer VR gaming. This article investigates how different game
design approaches affect the player experience during an asymmetric multiplayer
VR game. Four versions of a VR experience were created and tested in a study
involving 74 participants. Each version differs in terms of the sharing of
virtual environments (shared vs separated) and the players' dependency on the
experience (mutual vs unidirectional). The results showed that variations in
game design influenced aspects of the player experience, such as system
usability, pragmatic UX quality, immersion control, and intrinsic motivation.
Notably, the player roles and the co-presence in the virtual environment did
not simultaneously impact these aspects, suggesting that the degree to which
players depend on each other changes the player experience.

TL;DR: 研究探索了盲人和低视力旅客在自动驾驶车辆旅程中不同阶段的信息需求，提出了一个结构化框架来提升这些用户的出行信息获取和独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆（AVs）正成为盲人和低视力（BLV）旅客的有前途的交通解决方案，提供了更大的独立出行潜力。本文探讨了BLV用户在交通旅程的多个步骤中的信息需求，包括独立寻找和导航到车辆、进入和退出车辆。

Method: 通过对202位BLV受访者进行调查和12位BLV个人进行访谈，了解BLV终端用户的观点，并确定了成功旅行所需的自然语言信息的顺序。调查确定了三个旅行阶段的关键信息需求，而访谈帮助确定了这些信息呈现的优先次序，以确保对旅行者的描述可及。

Result: 调查和访谈共同揭示，BLV用户优先需要知道车辆的品牌和型号，以及在导航阶段如何找到正确的车辆。他们还强调在进入车辆时确认车辆目的地和车上安全特性的重要性。在退出时，BLV用户重视有关障碍物和障碍的信息，以及了解从车辆的哪一侧下车。此外，结果还显示，BLV旅客希望在从AV获取信息时使用自己的智能手机设备，并且偏好基于音频的互动方式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个结构化框架，用于向盲人和低视力（BLV）用户提供与旅行相关的信息，帮助设计者结合自然语言描述，为每个旅行阶段量身定制信息。这项研究对于在自动驾驶车辆（AV）旅程中对交通相关描述进行排序具有重要意义，从而最终提高BLV人士的流动性和独立性。

Abstract: Purpose: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming a promising transportation
solution for blind and low-vision (BLV) travelers, offering the potential for
greater independent mobility. This paper explores the information needs of BLV
users across multiple steps of the transportation journey, including finding
and navigating to, entering, and exiting vehicles independently.
  Methods: A survey with 202 BLV respondents and interviews with 12 BLV
individuals revealed the perspectives of BLV end-users and informed the
sequencing of natural language information required for successful travel.
Whereas the survey identified key information needs across the three trip
segments, the interviews helped prioritize how that information should be
presented in a sequence of accessible descriptions to travelers.
  Results: Taken together, the survey and interviews reveal that BLV users
prioritize knowing the vehicle's make and model and how to find the correct
vehicle during the navigation phase. They also emphasize the importance of
confirmations about the vehicle's destination and onboard safety features upon
entering the vehicle. While exiting, BLV users value information about hazards
and obstacles, as well as knowing which side of the vehicle to exit.
Furthermore, results highlight that BLV travelers desire using their own
smartphone devices when receiving information from AVs and prefer audio-based
interaction.
  Conclusion: The findings from this research contribute a structured framework
for delivering trip-related information to BLV users, useful for designers
incorporating natural language descriptions tailored to each travel segment.
This work offers important contributions for sequencing transportation-related
descriptions throughout the AV journey, ultimately enhancing the mobility and
independence of BLV individuals.

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are
available at https://github.com/asdryau/TransPhase.

*Vignesh V Menon,Adam Wieckowski,Yiquin Liu,Benjamin Bross,Detlev Marpe*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes CU-guided strategies to reduce encoding time in VVC multi-rate encodings, achieving up to 11.69% time reduction with little impact on bitrate, beneficial for adaptive streaming applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of UHD content, efficient multi-rate encoding is necessary for adaptive streaming. However, VVC's high computational complexity makes this challenging. The paper aims to reduce redundant computations while preserving video quality.

Method: The authors propose single- and double-bound approaches that leverage CU depth constraints from reference encodes to guide dependent encodes across multiple QPs. These methods are evaluated using the VVenC encoder with various presets.

Result: The proposed methods achieve up to 11.69% reduction in encoding time with minimal bitrate overhead (<0.6%), demonstrating consistent improvements in encoding efficiency across various presets.

Conclusion: CU-guided strategies can significantly reduce the encoding time in VVC for multi-rate encoding while maintaining high video quality, demonstrating potential for scalable application in adaptive streaming.

Abstract: The demand for efficient multi-rate encoding techniques has surged with the
increasing prevalence of ultra-high-definition (UHD) video content,
particularly in adaptive streaming scenarios where a single video must be
encoded at multiple bitrates to accommodate diverse network conditions. While
Versatile Video Coding (VVC) significantly improves compression efficiency, it
introduces considerable computational complexity, making multi-rate encoding a
resource-intensive task. This paper examines coding unit (CU) partitioning
strategies to minimize redundant computations in VVC while preserving high
video quality. We propose single- and double-bound approaches, leveraging CU
depth constraints from reference encodes to guide dependent encodes across
multiple QPs. These methods are evaluated using VVenC with various presets,
demonstrating consistent improvements in encoding efficiency. Our methods
achieve up to 11.69 % reduction in encoding time with minimal bitrate overhead
(<0.6 %). Comparative Pareto-front (PF) analysis highlights the superior
performance of multi-rate approaches over existing configurations. These
findings validate the potential of CU-guided strategies for scalable multi-rate
encoding in adaptive streaming.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large
language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and
context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into
shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising
near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such
systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework
to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to
three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We
derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly,
(ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the
achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify
regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between
agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either
resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of
experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical
outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory.
Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable
multi-agent reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 本文呼吁重新思考静态、任务特定的模拟基准，提出了结合大型语言模型和多智能体动力学的架构评估，介绍了一种新分类法，并建议了一条研究路线图以实现更具适应性和社会意识的多智能体模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于当前的大多数模拟限制在静态沙盒中，这些沙盒具有预定义的任务、有限的动态和僵化的评估标准，难以捕捉真实社会的复杂性，本文旨在重新思考任务特定的静态基准的局限性。

Method: 本文对结合大型语言模型（llm）和多智能体动力学的新的架构进行了批判性回顾，介绍了一种新的分类法，并提出了以开放性、连续共同进化为中心的发展路线图。

Result: 作者介绍了一种新的分类法，并描绘了以开放性、连续共同进化、以及开发具备韧性和社会对齐的人工智能生态系统为中心的研究路线图。

Conclusion: 我们呼吁社区超越静态范式，共同塑造下一代自适应、具备社会意识的多智能体模拟。

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt,
and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering
multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities
for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current
simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by
predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These
limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies.
In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally
inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures
that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as
balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling
to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving
field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness,
continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI
ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms
and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent
simulations.}

TL;DR: DOTechnique enhances model validity assessment by focusing on decision consistency, not just output similarity, offering an efficient method to identify model validity regions, demonstrated via a highway lane change example.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional validity approaches often rely on predefined frames that may not be available or sufficient. The need for efficient and adaptable methods in determining model validity, particularly in guiding decision processes, motivated the introduction of DOTechnique.

Method: Introduces DOTechnique, a method focusing on decision consistency for determining model validity. It compares decisions derived from surrogate and high-fidelity models, integrating domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to enhance computational efficiency.

Result: The highway lane change system example demonstrates that DOTechnique can effectively reveal the validity region of simulation models. The technique proves efficient and adaptable in identifying model validity, highlighting its usefulness in decision-support contexts.

Conclusion: DOTechnique successfully identifies validity regions by assessing the consistency of decisions human experts would make using surrogate models versus high-fidelity models. It shows promise in efficiently defining regions of model validity in various contexts.

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

Motivation: 研究动机是探讨大型语言模型在进行经典因果推理任务时是否会产生因果错觉，这一错觉通常存在于人类认知中并导致认知偏差。

Method: 研究者构建了1,000个医药背景下的无因果联系场景，然后要求大型语言模型评估潜在原因的有效性，以检查模型在经典认知科学范式中的表现。

Result: 研究发现，所有评估的大型语言模型在无因果联系的情境中系统地推断出了不当的因果关系，显示出对因果错觉的高度敏感性。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在因果推理任务中容易产生不当的因果关系，即使在信息不充分的情境中也会做出这种推断。这对模型在需要精准因果推理的领域中的使用提出了警告。

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

Conclusion: STEMS框架能够有效解决建筑能源管理中的关键挑战，通过空间-时间增强和安全约束的协调，实现更高的成本效益、排放减少和安全性能。

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

Motivation: 针对传统单一模态方法无法全面监测文化遗产退化问题，提出多模态架构以捕捉环境压力与材料退化的复杂关系。

Method: 本文提出一种轻量化多模态架构，采用简化的编码器和自适应Barlow Twins损失函数，以防止过拟合并鼓励模态互补性，成功融合传感器数据和视觉图像。

Result: 模型在斯特拉斯堡大教堂数据上达到76.9%的准确率，比现有标准多模态架构提升43%，比基础PerceiverIO提升25%。

Conclusion: 简单的架构结合对比正则化能够在数据稀缺的遗产监测环境中有效实现多模态学习，为基于AI的保护决策支持系统提供基础。

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA is a bi-encoder model for efficient real-time retrieval of clinical orders, improving performance and reducing reliance on LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues with latency, instability, and opacity in real-time clinical orders due to LLM rewriting, the authors propose a direct retrieval system without relying on LLMs.

Method: The paper presents JEDA, a domain-initialized bi-encoder model fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and enhanced by LLM guidance techniques to align intents with canonical order concepts.

Result: JEDA achieves substantial performance gains over existing systems in real-time clinical order retrieval, with better noise resilience and generalization.

Conclusion: JEDA significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of retrieving clinical orders from conversations.

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Result: ARM-FM在多样化的环境中展示了有效性，包括零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: ARM-FM通过利用基础模型的高级推理能力，自动构建奖励机器，从而实现自动化的组合奖励设计，提高了强化学习的任务分解能力。同时，自然语言目标规范的提升增加了通用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of error propagation in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which disrupts collaborative problem solving due to cascading errors.

Method: MASC employs a metacognitive framework with real-time, unsupervised step-level error detection and correction, using Next-Execution Reconstruction and Prototype-Guided Enhancement for anomaly detection.

Result: MASC outperforms baselines on the Who&When benchmark, improving step-level error detection by up to 8.47% AUC-ROC, and shows consistent end-to-end gains across different MAS architectures.

Conclusion: MASC framework significantly improves error detection and correction in multi-agent systems, effectively mitigating error propagation with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

Motivation: 目前多模态大模型(MLLM)的数学推理能力较弱，研究人员想知道MLLM能否从现成的数学大模型(LLM)中直接吸收数学推理能力，并通过模型合并方法探讨这一问题。

Method: 提出了IP-Merging方法，该方法首先识别MLLM和数学LLM中与推理相关的参数，然后将其投射到MLLM的子空间以保持对齐，最后在此子空间内合并参数。

Conclusion: IP-Merging方法能够在不影响其他能力的情况下，直接提升多模态大模型(MLLM)的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 文章提出Rose-Frame框架诊断大语言模型中的认知和认识偏移，以提高AI部署的透明性并加强人机理解的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成的过程中由于是由统计预测产生的，而不是基于实地推理，可能导致生成的内容具有说服力但缺乏事实有效性。需要一个新的框架来诊断和治理这种问题。

Method: 本文提出了Rose-Frame三维框架来诊断人机交互中的认知和认识偏移，其包含三个轴：地图与领土、直觉与理性、冲突与确认。每个维度捕捉不同的失败模式，它们的结合放大了不对齐。

Result: Rose-Frame框架未试图通过更多数据或规则来修正LLM，而是作为一种工具，使模型的局限和用户假设得以显现，从而促进更透明和批判性地使用AI。

Conclusion: Rose-Frame提供了一种反思工具，通过揭示模型的局限性和用户的假设，使AI部署更加透明和批判性。人类的直觉和人工智能的直觉都必须由人类理性来治理。只有植入可反思和可证伪的监督，才能使机器的流畅性与人类理解保持一致。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

TL;DR: IMAGINE整合多智能体系统推理规划，高效端到端训练，推理能力大增。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在各种任务中取得了重大进展，但在复杂推理和规划上仍面临挑战，多智能体系统尽管具备优越的集体推理能力，但存在推理成本高等问题。

Method: 提出了一种通用的可扩展框架IMAGINE，通过将多智能体系统的推理和规划能力集成到单个模型中进行训练，实现简单的端到端训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用Qwen3-8B-Instruct作为基础模型并通过IMAGINE方法训练后，在TravelPlanner基准测试中的最终通过率达到82.7%，显著超过DeepSeek-R1-671B的40%。

Conclusion: IMAGINE框架成功整合了多智能体系统的推理和规划能力，并通过简单的端到端训练显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨规划领域定义语言（PDDL）中公理的应用及其与数据库查询语言的类比，特别是如何处理公理体中否定谓词的出现。

Method: 研究了PDDL标准中否定谓词的使用限制，并根据文献中常见的分层公理集概念，提出了一种消除推导谓词负出现的转换方法。

Result: 提出了一种转化方法，可以移除推导谓词的负出现，使其保持与最小不动点逻辑表达的查询一致。

Conclusion: PDDL中的公理与数据库查询语言具有相似性，通过适当的转化可以消除公理中的负谓词并保持逻辑一致性。

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

Result: 这篇论文研究了2021年至2025年间荷兰公共健康领域机器学习研究中的算法偏见问题。作者通过系统性文献综述，应用他们开发的算法偏见风险评估工具（RABAT）来分析35篇同行评审的研究，发现虽然数据采样和缺失数据处理实践得到较好记录，但大多数研究缺乏对公平性框架、亚群分析以及潜在危害的透明讨论。

Conclusion: 作者总结出改进公共健康机器学习研究公平性的一些可操作性建议，旨在确保算法创新能够推进健康公平而非阻碍。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然COUP提供了良好的理论保证，但其实际性能尚未与广泛使用的启发式方法相竞争，因此需要在不影响其理论保证的前提下提高其实用性能。

Method: 通过一系列对COUP实用性能的改进，并进行实验验证这些改进的效果。

Conclusion: 本文在COUP的基础上，通过一系列改进提高了其实证性能，使其在保证理论上的优越性的同时，具有更强的实践竞争力。

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模型融合方法中，任务向量成为一个基本构建块。然而，由于任务无关冗余导致的矛盾问题，使得合并模型的性能显著下降。因此，本文旨在通过在知识感知子空间中净化任务向量来解决这一问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新的模型融合方法，称为Purifying Task Vectors（PAVE），通过在知识感知子空间中进行净化来优化任务向量。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用PAVE方法能显著提升多种合并方法、任务和模型架构的性能。

Conclusion: PAVE方法作为一种即插即用的方案，可应用于各种基于任务向量的融合方法，并提升其性能。

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

TL;DR: CoAST是一种POI推荐框架，通过结合世界知识及人类认知信息提升推荐性能，实验表明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户的下一个兴趣点（POI）推荐任务旨在根据他们的偏好和历史签到预测用户的下一个目的地，在基于位置的服务中意义重大。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在推荐系统中具有巨大潜力，但由于缺乏对结构化地理实体和必要的序列运动模式的理解，它们在预测下一个POI时存在不足。同时，在工业规模的POI预测应用中，结合世界知识和人类认知（如季节、天气条件、假期和用户档案信息）可以提升用户体验并提高推荐性能。为了应对这些问题，作者提出了CoAST框架。

Method: CoAST框架主要包括两个阶段：（1）通过对去敏化用户的增强空间-时间轨迹数据进行持续预训练来获取推荐知识；（2）通过监督微调（SFT）和后续的强化学习（RL）阶段使用丰富的训练数据来使认知判断与人类偏好保持一致。

Result: 通过对各类真实世界数据集的广泛离线实验和在高德地图APP首页“猜你会去哪”上部署的在线实验，验证了CoAST的有效性。

Conclusion: CoAST框架有效地结合了世界知识、空间-时间轨迹模式、用户档案及情境信息来提升POI推荐系统的性能，并通过实验验证。

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ToolPRM, a model to improve structured output tasks like function calling in LLMs by using inference scaling. It provides fine-grained supervision and significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the lack of research on inference scaling for structured outputs, specifically function calling, which is critical for enhancing LLM performance.

Method: The paper proposes an inference scaling framework combining fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, alongside a fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset.

Result: The proposed ToolPRM model outperforms existing models in predictive accuracy and enhances the performance of backbone models in various function calling tasks.

Conclusion: ToolPRM significantly improves function calling tasks by providing fine-grained supervision during the inference process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在探索与利用之间存在系统性偏向，表现为提高的pass@1但降低的pass@K性能。作者希望理解这一问题并提出解决方案。

Method: SimKO通过对不同响应施加不同的概率调整，促进探索：对正确响应提高top-K候选的概率；对错误响应惩罚top-1候选的概率。

Result: 通过分析RLVR方法的训练动态，揭示了概率集中效应，并且提出了SimKO方法来缓解该问题，从而改善探索能力。实验表明SimKO在多个基准测试中稳定提高了pass@K表现。

Conclusion: SimKO设计有效缓解了概率过度集中的问题，稳定提高了RLVR在各种基准测试中的pass@K表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

Motivation: 目前的NL2SQL方法在处理大规模SQL数据库时，需要处理大量数据库元信息，导致提示过长和处理成本高。

Method: 提出了Datalake Agent系统，该系统使用一个互动循环来减少大量元信息用于NL2SQL任务的处理。

Result: Datalake Agent在一个包含23个数据库和100个表问答任务的集合上进行了评估，减少了LLM所需的令牌量达87%，从而显著降低了成本。

Conclusion: Datalake Agent通过互动循环减少了LLM使用的元信息，从而降低了处理成本，同时保持了竞争性性能。

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的双阶段微调框架RoboGPT-R1，通过在监督学习后进行强化学习，显著提升了具身智能体在复杂现实环境中的推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting enhances LLM prompt adherence, improving performance as more instructions are added and providing developers tools to understand instruction conflicts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The research aims to improve the adherence of large language models (LLMs) to given instructions within prompts, as merely adding instructions does not guarantee compliance.

Method: The study introduces a method called Instruction Boosting, which is applied post-generation to improve the adherence to prompts by LLMs. It also utilizes a benchmark named SCALEDIF to evaluate the effect of increased instruction volume.

Result: Instruction Boosting leads to a 7-point improvement for two instructions and a 4-point improvement for ten instructions in adherence rates. The study includes the development of a conflict scoring tool to assess the impact of instruction volume on model performance.

Conclusion: Instruction Boosting significantly enhances the reliability of prompt instructions for LLMs by addressing issues related to instruction adherence and potential performance degradation due to instruction conflicts.

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成-过滤-精炼（迭代范式）基于大型语言模型在AI+Science中的推理、编程和程序发现中取得进展。然而，搜索的有效性取决于搜索的位置，即如何将领域先验编码进操作结构化的假设空间中。为此，该论文提出了一种理论来优化这种搜索策略。

Method: 论文中将智能体表示为输入输出上的模糊关系算子，捕捉可行的过渡，并在固定的安全包络下进行约束。通过对可达路径加权并合成为覆盖生成函数，从而度量可达难度，并提供搜索图的几何解释。进一步通过多数票实例化验证最简单的可测试推理。

Result: 该理论提供了一种可行的语言和操作工具来测量智能体及其搜索空间，并提出了由LLM构建的迭代搜索的系统形式描述。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种紧凑的形式理论，描述和测量由领域先验指导的LLM辅助迭代搜索。通过将智能体表示为输入输出上的模糊关系算子，捕捉可行的过渡，以此在固定的安全包络下约束智能体。

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 将康德的理念与反馈控制理论结合起来，通过H-Risk分析推理系统中的过度自信现象，尤其是在大语言模型中的应用揭示了其缺陷。这为诊断和降低推理系统过度自信提供了一种新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将康德的《纯粹理性批判》重新解释为反馈稳定性的理论，将理性视为一种调节器，使推理保持在可能经验的范围内。

Method: 通过使用线性-高斯模拟中的组合不稳定性指数（H-Risk），结合谱边界、条件、时间敏感性和创新放大进行形式化分析。应用于大语言模型以观察其内部动态与校准误差和幻觉之间的关系。

Result: 在用于线性-高斯模拟的分析中，即使在形式上稳定的情况下，较高的H-Risk也可以预测过度自信的错误。对大型语言模型的扩展研究显示，其内部动态的脆弱性与错误校准和幻觉相关，而批判风格的提示则对校准和幻觉的影响不一。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了合理性与控制系统之间的结构性联系，提出了一种诊断并选择性降低推理系统中过度自信的方法。

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Motivation: 解决当前PRM中存在的奖励噪声、低事实保真度以及与步骤层次推理目标不匹配的问题。

Method: 使用MCTS构建结构化推理路径，并使用外部工具验证每个中间步骤，以消除幻觉监督。融合工具验证与MCTS反馈，设计混合奖励聚合机制。

Result: 使用40K自动标注样本训练的GroundedPRM，虽只占最佳PRM数据量的10%，但在ProcessBench上平均性能相对提升达26%。在奖励指导的贪心搜索中，也超越了人工标注训练的PRM。

Conclusion: GroundedPRM框架通过树引导和忠实度感知的方法，提高了多步推理中的中间步骤监督，并且在自动标注条件下表现优异，超过了使用人工标注的PRM。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否有能力进行创作，尤其是在复杂机器组装任务中，理解其需要的能力如空间推理、战略组装和指令遵循。

Method: 引入一个名为BesiegeField的测试平台，该平台基于机器搭建游戏Besiege，模拟物理环境中基于部分的构建、物理模拟和奖励驱动的评估，结合强化学习技术进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 目前的开源大型语言模型在复杂机器设计任务上表现不足，通过强化学习可能是提升其性能的一个途径。

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

TL;DR: OMniFake dataset and UMFDet framework developed to detect both human and AI-generated fake content effectively, outperforming specialized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting both human-crafted and AI-generated fake content in an integrated manner, given the limitations of models specialized for only one type of deception.

Method: UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism.

Result: The UMFDet framework, based on the OmniFake dataset, demonstrates robust and consistent performance in detecting both human-crafted and AI-generated misinformation, better than specialized models.

Conclusion: UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.
