### [1] [Zero-shot image privacy classification with Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09253)
*Alina Elena Baia,Alessio Xompero,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are less accurate but more robust in image privacy prediction, compared to specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate the performance of VLMs against specialized models in image privacy prediction.

Method: Establish a zero-shot benchmark for fair comparison between VLMs and specialized models and evaluate using privacy benchmark.

Result: VLMs have lower accuracy but higher robustness compared to smaller specialized models.

Conclusion: VLMs are less accurate but more robust in image privacy prediction compared to specialized models.

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

### [2] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究比较了传统CNN、零次预训练和微调的多模态LLM，证明LLM可在有限数据集上微调后，显著提升对象检测任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对象检测与理解领域的发展，传统的CNN模型与新兴的多模态语言模型（LLM）在驱动相关进展方面都发挥着重要作用。然而，LLM若未经微调便直接使用，可能导致其在专业视觉任务中的性能不足，因此研究微调后的LLM在低资源环境中的表现及其效率。

Method: 本文进行了传统CNN模型、零次预训练多模态LLM与微调多模态LLM在人工文本覆盖检测任务上的综合比较，并证明通过对LLM进行微调，可在非常有限的数据（少于1,000张图像）中实现显著的性能改进。

Result: 研究结果显示，经过微调的多模态LLM能够显著提高在图像人工文本覆盖检测任务中的表现，其准确率提升可与传统需要大量数据训练的CNN基线相当甚至超越。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，通过微调多模态大语言模型，能够在非常有限的数据集上实现高达36%的准确率提升，达到或超过基于CNN的基线，这些基线通常需要数量级更多的数据。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对于诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类不平衡和有限的模型泛化能力等挑战继续阻碍进展。

Method: 本研究在公开的MRI数据集上进行了实验，重点关注焦点损失参数调优，并评估了三种数据增强技术的影响：水平翻转、旋转和缩放。

Conclusion: 通过提供所有代码和结果，这项研究建立了一个透明且可重复的基准，以指导未来关于脑肿瘤分割的增强策略和损失函数设计的研究。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [4] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究如何通过调整初始噪声实现早期逃离吸引盆，以减少记忆化并保持图像与文本的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在CFG应用之前，有必要促进早期逃离记忆化的吸引盆，从而能够在去噪过程中更快地应用CFG，避免生成与输入提示不对齐的非记忆化图像。

Method: 提出两种减缓策略，通过集体或单独地调整初始噪声来寻找并利用能够促进早期逃离吸引盆的初始样本。

Result: 调整初始噪声样本可以缩短逃离吸引盆的时间，从而有效减少记忆化现象，并提高图像与文本的对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过调整初始噪声样本可以显著减少文本到图像扩散模型的记忆化现象，同时保持图像与文本的对齐。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [5] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了AI生成图片中的性别偏差问题，通过对750幅职业图片的主题分析，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram均存在强化性别刻板印象的问题，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前AI生成的可视化研究多集中于生成过程和图像质量，而忽略了代表性偏差。随着AI图像工具的广泛使用，解决和减轻有害的性别偏差至关重要。该研究旨在填补这一研究空白，探讨AI生成的职业图片中存在的偏见问题，并提出改进建议。

Method: 该研究主要采用主题分析方法，对750幅AI生成的职业图片进行了分析，对DALL-E 3和Ideogram两种图像生成工具进行了比较，评估其在职业环境中的表现和代表性偏差.

Result: 研究发现，DALL-E 3和Ideogram在AI生成的职业图片中都强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。

Conclusion: AI可视化工具有可能加剧狭隘的表现形式，需要采取措施来改善多样性和代表性。在讨论部分，研究为实践者、个人和研究人员在生成具有可见性别的图片时增加代表性提供了建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [6] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过引入动态专家混合路由器，减少视觉自回归模型的计算冗余，实现了更快的推理速度和较少的计算量，同时保持图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型虽然能够高效且高质量地生成图像，但由于逐步增加分辨率时重复调用Transformer而存在计算冗余问题。

Method: 引入动态专家混合路由器，通过规模感知的阈值策略，选择专家进行计算，以减少计算冗余。

Result: 通过新的架构实现了20%较少的FLOPs，11%更快的推理速度，同时图像质量与稠密基线匹配。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种动态专家混合路由器集成到视觉自回归模型（VAR），通过规模感知的阈值策略，在无需额外训练的情况下，减少计算量，同时保持图像质量。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了改善活动识别的可靠性，本文提出Hi-OSCAR方法实现开放集分类，并收集了支持多种场景的NFI_FARED数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HAR中，生活中的活动范围与可以在注释传感器数据集中捕获的活动之间存在不可逾越的差距，未能正确处理未见活动会严重削弱任何HAR分类器的可靠性。

Method: 本文提出了一种层次化开放集分类方法Hi-OSCAR，可以识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时将未知类定位到最近的内部节点。

Result: 提出的Hi-OSCAR方法实现了开放集分类，并提供了比简单二元分类更深层次的洞察。NFI_FARED数据集支持未来的开放集HAR研究。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的方法Hi-OSCAR，通过结构化层次化活动类别，可以实现开放集分类。同时，收集了新的数据集NFI_FARED，支持多种活动场景。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种自动检测高频振荡的新方法，并展示其在癫痫患者中与手术效果的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测高频振荡具有挑战性，其临床特征尚未完全定义，因此开发自动化检测方法对于研究和临床使用至关重要。

Method: 研究开发了一种新的检测高频振荡的方法，利用S变换从时频域提取事件，并使用无监督聚类技术进行分类。

Result: 所提方法在控制数据集上达到了97.67%的敏感性、98.57%的准确率和97.78%的F分数。在癫痫患者中，研究结果显示手术效果与高频振荡的发生率有较强的关联性。

Conclusion: 研究确认去除高频振荡（尤其是快速波动）可导致癫痫发作解除，而存在高频振荡则会导致癫痫发作复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析DINOv2的表征机制，引入了Minkowski表征假说，提升了对视觉变换器在对象、场景和动作识别中的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DINOv2在对象、场景和动作识别中的表征特点，以及理解其感知本质。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)作为操作工具，并生成一个32,000个单位的词典作为研究的解释性基础。

Result: 研究表明表示在稠密和稀疏之间，并引入了Minkowski表征假说以改善对视觉变换器表征的理解。加之，研究揭示出概念协同工作的几何和统计特征，表现为表示组织超越了线性稀疏性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了粒子作为原型共混的观点，并引入了Minkowski表征假说来解释视觉变换器的表征。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用物理指导的退化自适应专家模型（PhyDAE）来改善遥感图像质量，显著提升恢复效果并降低计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的综合恢复方法过于依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理过程的明确建模，因此该论文提出了一种新方法来解决这一问题。

Method: PhyDAE方法采用两阶段级联架构，将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，并通过残差流形投影仪和频率感知退化分解器进行退化特性分析。

Result: 通过在三个基准数据集上的扩展实验，PhyDAE在所有四个恢复任务中表现优异，综合超越了最先进的方法，显著减少了参数数量和计算复杂性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种叫做PhyDAE的模型，它在恢复多种退化类型的遥感图像方面表现优异，并有效提升了恢复质量和计算效率。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机为中心的多模态模型，能够通过语言回归和扩散生成处理任意视角的场景。它将相机视作语言，提高了模型在基于相机的生成和理解任务中的性能，并能够处理多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机与视觉语言通常被孤立研究，Puffin旨在通过统一相机为中心的多模态模型扩展沿相机维度的空间感知能力，实现相机与视觉语言的结合。

Method: Puffin通过将相机视为语言，来弥合相机与视觉语言之间的差距。它使用全球相机参数和像素级相机图，实现灵活且可靠的空间生成。

Result: 通过指令调优，Puffin能够推广到不同的跨视图任务，如空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导。

Conclusion: Puffin通过整合语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法，实现了从任意视角解读和创造场景的功能。实验表明，Puffin在以相机为中心的生成和理解任务中表现优于专业化模型。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合生物机制的防御框架，通过眼动机制捕捉图像片段，提高了对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，且无需重新训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御通常依赖于计算密集型的优化（如对抗性训练或数据增强）来提高鲁棒性，而人类视觉系统通过进化的生物机制实现了对对抗性扰动的内在鲁棒性。我们假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码在这种鲁棒性中起关键作用。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的防御框架，结合了三种关键的生物机制：中央-外围处理机制、眼动机制和皮层填充机制。我们的方法采用强化学习导向的眼动，选择性地捕捉多个中央-外围的图像片段，将这些片段整合成一个重建图像进行分类。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同分类器和攻击类型下提高了系统的鲁棒性，同时与生物启发和非生物启发的防御技术相比，显著减少了训练开销。

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的预处理方法有效减轻了对抗性噪声，保持了语义完整性，并显著减少了训练开销，不需要对下游分类器进行重新训练或微调。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

accuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal
models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves
inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

TL;DR: LinearSR模型通过创新性策略解决了图像超分辨率中的诸多挑战，实现了效率和质量的双优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管线性注意力提供了O(N)的解决方案，但由于一系列未解决的问题，线性注意力在逼真的图像超分辨率中的应用潜力未得到充分开发。因此，该论文旨在解决这些关键挑战。

Conclusion: LinearSR模型在图像超分辨率领域实现了高效和高质量的生成。通过解决训练不稳定性和感知-扭曲权衡问题，以及采用轻量级指导范式，显著提高了生成效率和质量。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

TL;DR: 该研究利用AI和计算机视觉技术，提出了一种从视频中提取关键帧的方法，以非侵入性方式识别新西兰威胁鸟类kākā个体，实现高准确率的个体重新识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的进步特别是计算机视觉，为智能保护和有效自动化提供了鼓舞人心的解决方案。传统方法如鸟类的腿带识别耗时且具有侵入性，因此该研究提出了一个从视频中提取高质量关键帧的新方案，以提高野生动物个体识别和重新识别的效率。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

TL;DR: 文章介绍了自动驾驶系统中的驾驶意图预测任务，并提出了一种新模型和数据集来提高该任务的解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类之间互动的增加，确保驾驶系统决策过程的可解释性变得越来越重要，以确保安全驾驶操作。成功的人机交互需要理解环境和驾驶任务的潜在表示，而这在基于深度学习的系统中仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 为了解决驾驶意图预测的可解释性问题，文章提出了视频概念瓶颈模型（VCBM）框架，该框架能够在不依赖后期技巧的情况下生成空间和时间上连贯的解释。此外，还引入了多标签 t-SNE 可视化技术来展示不同解释之间的解缠和因果关系。

Result: 通过对 DAAD-X 数据集上的 VCBM 模型进行广泛评估，结果表明，基于 Transformer 的模型比传统的 CNN 模型表现出更大的可解释性。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一种新的多模态、以自我为中心的视频数据集 DAAD-X，以及一种视频概念瓶颈模型，并证明该模型在驾驶意图预测的解释性方面比传统的 CNN 模型更佳。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，通过模态对齐方案、困难负样本挖掘和门控交叉注意模块解决Med-VQA任务中的各种挑战，且在多个数据集上优于之前的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然最近利用医学视觉语言预训练（Med-VLP）的工作在Med-VQA任务中表现出强劲的性能，但尚无针对模态对齐的统一解决方案，且困难负样本问题仍未充分探索。此外，常用的知识融合技术可能引入无关信息。

Method: 本文提出了一种框架，通过三个关键贡献来解决挑战：一是采用对比学习和优化运输理论等方法实现多个层次、多个模态、多个视角和多个阶段的异构模态对齐统一解决方案；二是采用软标签的困难负样本挖掘方法，使多模态对齐并实施困难负对的区分；三是为Med-VQA设计的门控交叉注意模块，该模块整合答案词汇作为先验知识，并从中选择相关信息。

Result: 本文的方法在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最优表现。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法在广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了之前的最优表现。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR通过在视频中跳过无需精细处理的低细节区域，大幅加快超分辨率处理速度并降低计算成本，同时保持画质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对视频中的所有像素均匀处理，导致计算慢且代价高；许多区域本质上是低细节的，不需要精细处理。SkipSR利用这一点来加速视频超分辨率处理。

Method: 该方法提出了一种简单的框架SkipSR，通过直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要精细化处理的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在720p视频的标准超分辨率基准测试中，该方法与之前的模型相比，端到端延迟提高了60%，且质量无明显损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过跳过低细节区域的计算，无需在所有像素上运行超分辨率处理，显著加快了处理速度并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

Motivation: 视频语言模型在处理密集且时间扩展的视觉输入时存在挑战，而这种输入超出了图像模型的处理能力。本文旨在识别并解决这种适应过程中的关键挑战：感知瓶颈和标记过载问题。

Method: 该论文提出的D-CoDe框架通过动态压缩和问题分解来实现。动态压缩通过选择代表帧和内容感知聚合空间标记来缓解感知瓶颈；问题分解则通过将原始查询重新形成子问题来缓解标记过载。

Result: 实验表明，D-CoDe框架在各种基准上有效提高了视频理解能力，尤其是在处理具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为D-CoDe的无训练自适应框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解来有效构建视频大语言模型。实验表明，D-CoDe在多个基准测试上显著提高了视频理解能力，并在处理复杂视频语言任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达语义结构中的层级中家庭内概念以及跨家庭的组合。

Method: PHyCLIP使用了ℓ1-积度量在超球因子的笛卡尔乘积上进行建模。

Result: PHyCLIP在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP模型在多任务上超越现有的单空间方法，并提供了更具解释性的嵌入空间结构。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在不同分割模型之间的迁移能力较差，且复杂的上下文依赖和特征分布差异导致迁移成功率不理想，因此需要一种新的方法来提高迁移能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为SegTrans的攻击框架，通过将输入样本划分为多个局部区域并重新映射它们的语义信息来生成多样化的增强样本，以优化扰动并提高对抗样本的迁移能力。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集上进行的大量实验表明，SegTrans方法在提高迁移攻击成功率方面表现出色，平均提高8.55%，计算效率提高超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans方法显著提高了攻击成功率和计算效率，在不增加额外计算量的情况下超越现有方法。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [25] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a runtime defense called ASVP against KD attacks in image restoration models, improving defense effectiveness without harming teacher model outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge in defending against knowledge distillation attacks in image restoration tasks, where traditional methods used in classification tasks are ineffective due to the generative nature of image restoration.

Method: The proposed method is Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), which involves perturbing internal feature maps of the teacher model using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to inject high-frequency perturbations.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ASVP can decrease student model performance significantly with reductions in PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, while maintaining the performance of the teacher model.

Conclusion: ASVP provides a practical and strong defense mechanism against KD attacks on image restoration models by significantly reducing student performance without compromising teacher model outputs.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DisTANCE benchmark and Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) to enhance perception accuracy in LVLMs, achieving significant improvements in precision and attention to image tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the gap in visual perception impact when applying inference-time scaling strategies to multimodal reasoning.

Method: Introduction of a perception-centric benchmark (DisTANCE) and the Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) paradigm along with reinforcement learning techniques.

Result: PTS raised high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, with consistent gains in reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks.

Conclusion: Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) significantly improves perception accuracy and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过增强毫米波的姿态估计器输出，提高关节位置和活动识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波的姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型更多地依赖统计先验，而不是传感器数据，这种过度依赖损害了例如手势和活动识别等下游任务的性能。

Method: 论文提出了mmJoints框架，它通过为预训练的黑箱毫米波3D姿态估计器的输出增加额外的关节描述符来增强模型的能力。

Result: 通过对超过115,000个信号帧的13个姿态估计设置进行广泛评估，mmJoints估算描述符的错误率低于4.2%，提高关节位置准确性最多12.5%，活动识别提升至多16%。

Conclusion: 该论文介绍了一种名为mmJoints的框架，通过估计关节被传感的可能性和位置预测的可靠性，以增强解释性并提高下游任务的准确性。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出HiMIR框架，通过层次化方法提高图像检索准确性和效率，并显著减少计算资源，优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态大语言模型应用中，为了有效利用用户特定数据，采用了检索增强生成技术。然而，传统检索方法往往存在检索准确性有限的问题。近期的多向量检索技术通过分解查询并与分割图像进行匹配来提高准确性，但仍存在次优的准确性和效率问题，忽略了查询与不同图像对象之间的对齐问题，以及多余的细粒度图像片段。因此，研究旨在提升图像检索的准确性和效率。

Method: 引入了一种名为HiMIR的高效调度框架。首先，引入了一种新的层次化模式，采用多个中间粒度来增强不同图像对象的对齐性。其次，通过利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性来最小化冗余的匹配计算。此外，自动为每个数据集配置参数，以提高在不同场景中的实用性。

Result: HiMIR在准确性方面实现了显著的提升，并在计算上减少了多至3.5倍的资源消耗，相较于现有的多向量检索系统有明显优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种有效的图像检索调度框架HiMIR，能够在各种场景中自动优化检索过程，并显著改善检索的准确性和效率。HiMIR通过其创新的层次化方法，成功解决了传统检索方法在图像对象对齐和计算冗余方面的问题。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 提出了针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务，开发了HandEval质量评估模型。结果显示，该模型在检测生成手的质量上比现有方法更优秀，并提升了图像生成和检测的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在生成复杂局部区域的细节上仍存在困难，尤其是人类的手部，导致结构失真和不真实的纹理。这限制了下游任务的表现，如以人为中心的生成质量优化和AIGC检测。因此，我们提出了针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务。

Method: 提出HandPair数据集，并开发了HandEval质量评估模型，结合了多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）的视觉理解能力和手关键点的先验知识。

Result: 在测试集中，HandEval比现有最先进方法与人类判断更一致。将其集成到图像生成和AIGC检测管道中，提升了生成手的真实感和检测准确性。码和数据集将公开。

Conclusion: HandEval超越了现有的最先进方法，与人类判断有更好的一致性，并且在图像生成和AIGC检测管道中提升了生成手部的真实感和检测准确性，证明了其在下游应用中具有普遍的有效性。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前尚无有效方法可以防止AI未授权着色及其可能导致的版权侵犯。为解决此问题，需要一种能够嵌入不可感知扰动以阻止未经授权着色的方法。

Method: 使用感知增强色彩限制扰动（PAChroma）方法，通过优化由拉普拉斯滤波器处理过的不可感知扰动，以保留感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化输入转换以增强模型间转移性和对常见后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，PAChroma在确保视觉外观的同时，有效地降低了着色质量。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的防御范式——不可着色样例，用于嵌入不可感知的扰动以无效化未经授权的着色。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型因其顺序的逐个token解码过程导致推理速度慢，需要数千次模型前向传递来生成一张图像。为了提高效率，我们提出了新的方法以加快生成过程。

Method: 我们提出了Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2) 框架，该框架将去噪过程纳入到Jacobi迭代中，以实现自回归模型中的并行token生成。该方法引入了一个预测下一个干净token的范式，能够使经过预训练的自回归模型接受噪声干扰的token嵌入，并通过低成本微调预测下一个干净token。

Result: 实验表明，SJD2方法通过减少模型前向传递次数加速了生成过程，同时保持了生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，SJD2方法能够在保持生成图像视觉质量的同时，通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成过程。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Method: 提出了一种熵知情解码策略，包括动态温度控制和熵感知接受规则，从而提高生成质量并加快合成速度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种基准测试中提高了生成质量和采样速度，在不增加计算开销的情况下实现了85%的推理成本近无损生成。

Conclusion: 通过高效的熵知情解码策略提高了自回归图像生成模型的质量和速度。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Motivation: 在现有方法不能有效适用于3D LiDAR数据的情况下，提出了一种新的任务——在噪声标签下LiDAR语义分割的领域泛化（DGLSS-NL），并建立了首个基准以适应这一任务。

Method: 提出了一种双视图框架DuNe，其中分为强和弱分支，通过特征级别的一致性和基于信心的过滤预测来优化交叉熵损失。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI、nuScenes和SemanticPOSS数据集上分别实现了56.86%、42.28%和52.58%的mIoU，并在10%的对称标签噪声下整体取得了49.57%的算术平均（AM）和48.50%的调和平均（HM），表现出稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，通过使用双视图框架DuNe，可以在有噪声标签的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化任务中实现稳健的性能表现。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and

accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID

Result: The transformation resulted in reducing activated parameters by 60%, maintaining original performance, and surpassing pruning-based approaches.

Conclusion: Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation by transforming large diffusion transformers into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) structure, effectively reducing activated parameters and maintaining performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an

comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一种数据生成管道，可通过合成物体增强检测和定位模型的训练效果，特别是在数据稀缺情况下显示出显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模标注数据集成本高昂，覆盖面有偏差且难以扩展；合成数据具有潜力但通常缺乏灵活性、准确性和构成多样性，因此需要一种新的数据生成方法。

Method: 提出了一个简单且可扩展的数据合成管道SOS，基于以物体为中心的组合策略，通过将高质量的合成物体片段贴到新图像中，并使用结构化布局先验和生成照明来生成准确丰富的遮罩、边框和引用表达。

Result: 在LVIS检测和gRefCOCO定位任务上分别提高了10.9和8.4的性能分数。采用SOS生成的数据集具有可控性，可以在非常有限的真实数据条件下实现较大性能提升。

Conclusion: 利用SOS合成生成的数据，模型在检测和定位任务上优于使用真实数据集训练的模型，在低数据量和封闭词汇设置下改善了泛化能力，并在有限的真实数据条件下取得更大的性能提升。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Conclusion: 研究提出了多模态语义扩散模型（MSDM），通过生成逼真的图像-掩码对，提高细胞和核分割模型的精度，从而系统地弥补数据集的不足。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

### [43] [Polar Separable Transform for Efficient Orthogonal Rotation-Invariant Image Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09125)
*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT is a new separable orthogonal transform that overcomes computational inefficiencies in image analysis, demonstrating significant improvements in stability and efficiency while maintaining high classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical orthogonal moment-based image representations suffer from high computational complexity and numerical instability at large orders, necessitating a more efficient separable transform for robust image analysis.

Method: PSepT is introduced as a separable orthogonal transform, achieving complete kernel factorization through tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, allowing independent radial and angular processing.

Result: PSepT reduces computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over existing methods, with experimental results confirming improved performance.

Conclusion: PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties, leading to better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while ensuring exact reconstruction.

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无须CT扫描的图像处理支气管镜导航方法，效果优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于支气管树结构复杂以及医生经验和培训的差异，传统基于 CT 的导航技术需要额外设置、扫描和培训。作者寻求无需 CT 扫描的简化方法。

Method: 使用只在幻影数据上训练的图像处理算法进行拓扑定位，避免了现实数据标记的高成本。

Result: 在测试序列中，该方法在真实数据上的表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位流程，无需患者 CT 扫描即可在手术期间提供导航帮助。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新方法，合成生成跨多个领域和条件的对象实例，以替代大规模数据收集，显著提升实例级识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于实例级识别的细粒度特性，使得创建大规模注释数据集变得具有挑战性，限制了其在各个领域的实际应用。

Method: 我们的方法合成生成了来自多个领域的多样化对象实例，并在不同条件和背景下形成了大规模训练集。然后对基础视觉模型进行微调，提升检索性能。

Result: 在生成的数据上对基础视觉模型进行微调，显著提高了跨多个领域的七个实例级识别基准的检索性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在不依赖任何真实图像的情况下，显著提高了跨多个领域的实例级识别基准测试的检索性能，为广泛的实际应用打开了大门。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO 框架解决了目标检测中未知对象分类的问题，采用独特的架构，提升了开集检测性能，并将在代码上开放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测器受限于“闭合世界”假设，难以处理真实场景下的未知对象；而现有的开集检测方法仅标识‘未知’对象不足以满足安全关键场景的决策需求。

Method: TARO 采用独特架构，包括基于 sparsemax 的 head 以建模对象性、层次引导的重标组件提供辅助监督、以及学习层次关系的分类模块。

Result: TARO 实验表明，它能够将未知对象分类为有意义的粗类，减少已知与未知类别之间的混淆，同时在未知召回和已知 mAP 上实现竞争性表现。

Conclusion: TARO 框架有效识别和分类未知对象，不仅提高了检测的准确性，还增强了在安全关键场景中的决策能力。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在线视频深度估计方法oVDA，它结合LLM技术，通过缓存潜在特征和掩蔽帧，实现了低显存使用和高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VDA方法依赖批处理，无法用于在线环境，因此需要一种能够在线进行视频深度估计的方法。

Method: oVDA结合了大型语言模型的技术，通过在推理过程中缓存潜在特征和在训练时对帧进行掩蔽来实现在线深度估计。

Result: oVDA能够在NVIDIA A100设备上达到42 FPS，在NVIDIA Jetson边缘设备上达到20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA方法在准确性和显存使用方面均优于现有的在线视频深度估计方法，并且其低显存使用对于在边缘设备上的部署尤其重要。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial

study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时序变压器架构（TRT），通过实验验证其在LOS和NLOS成像中的优越表现，并贡献了相关的合成和真实数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的三维重建任务由于传感器的低量子效率和高噪声水平的挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下，仍然面临挑战。为了在光子高效成像中提高三维重建性能，提出了一种新的架构。

Method: 提出了一种通用的时序变压器（TRT）架构，具有两个精巧的注意力设计：空间时间自注意力编码器和空间时间交叉注意力解码器。实验中，开发了TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个任务特定的实例，并进行了广泛的实验验证。

Result: 广泛实验证明，TRT架构的两个实例显著优于现有方法。此外，贡献了一个大型高分辨率合成视线数据集和一组真实世界的非视线测量数据，增加了该领域的数据多样性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通用的时序变压器（TRT）架构，解决了光子高效成像中三维重建的性能问题。与现有的变压器不同，TRT具有两种精巧的注意力设计，分别针对空间和时间瞬态测量。此外，开发了两个任务特定的实例：TRT-LOS用于视线成像和TRT-NLOS用于非视线成像。通过广泛实验证明，这些实例在不同的合成和真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVI通过错误循环调优，实现了无限长视频生成中的高时间一致性和场景过渡，并验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法在单提示外推时表现有限，产生同质场景和重复动作的原因在于训练假设与测试时自动回归现实间的差异。为了解决这个假设差距，SVI提出通过将自生成的错误回收转换为监督提示，以引导模型识别和纠正其错误。

Method: SVI采用错误循环调优的训练方法，通过注入、收集和存储错误，采取闭环循环进行学习来回收自生成的错误。同时，通过单步双向积分进行预测近似，并通过残差计算错误，将错误动态存储于重播记忆中以重采样用于新输入。

Result: SVI能够在不增加额外推理成本的情况下，将视频从秒级扩展至无限时长，同时兼容多种条件（如音频、骨架和文本流）。在三个基准上评估，验证了其多功能性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Stable Video Infinity (SVI)通过引入错误循环调优的训练方法，有效解决了长视频生成中的错误累积问题，在生成无限长度视频时实现了高时间一致性、合理的场景过渡和可控的故事情节流。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

Motivation: 如何准确捕捉用户在不同领域的行为模式，为消费者提供个性化服务，同时保持体验的流畅性，是现代消费电子和电商平台面临的挑战。

Method: 利用LLM生成语义标签，并通过多重注意力机制融合增强的物品表示，实现跨域用户偏好建模。

Result: 在四个大型电商数据集上，TEMA-LLM性能优于现有技术基准。

Conclusion: TEMA-LLM有效整合了LLM生成的语义标签，通过多重注意力机制提升跨域推荐系统的表现。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in

TL;DR: 研究发现，离散语义熵（DSE）能够通过量化语义不一致性可靠地检测视觉语言模型中的幻觉现象，并显著提高诊断回答的准确率，这是临床视觉语言模型应用的有效过滤策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确定使用离散语义熵（DSE）来拒绝可能产生幻觉的问题是否能够提高黑箱视觉语言模型（VLMs）在基于放射图像的视觉问答（VQA）中准确性。

Method: 使用两个公开的、去识别化的数据集进行了一项回顾性研究，分别为VQA-Med 2019基准（500张图片，带有临床问题和短文本答案）和一个诊断放射学数据集（206个案例：60个CT扫描，60个MRI图像，60个X射线片，26个血管造影图）与相应的真实诊断。使用GPT-4o和GPT-4.1在温度为1.0的情况下回答每个问题15次，并通过双向蕴涵检查对意义相等的响应进行分组，从响应的语义簇的相对频率中计算DSE。准确度在排除掉DSE大于0.6或0.3的问题后重新计算。使用自举重采样和Bonferroni校正的p < .004的阈值来获得p值和95%置信区间。

Result: 在706个图像-问题对中，GPT-4o的基线准确率为51.7%，GPT-4.1为54.8%。过滤掉高熵问题（DSE > 0.3）后，剩余问题的准确率为GPT-4o的76.3%（保留问题：334/706）和GPT-4.1的63.8%（保留问题：499/706）（均p < .001）。准确度的提高在两个数据集中都有观察到，并在经过Bonferroni校正后大多仍然具有统计学意义。

Conclusion: 离散语义熵（DSE）能够有效地检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）可能产生的幻觉现象，并通过量化语义不一致性显著提高诊断回答的准确性，为临床视觉语言模型应用提供了一种过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样策略中，要么忽略时间线索，要么增加系统复杂性，因此需要改进以优化时序句子定位和视频对象分割。

Method: 引入了一种新的时序句子定位(TSG)范式，并设计了基于时刻的采样策略(MCS)和双向锚点更新传播(BAP)。

Result: 提出的框架优化了关键时刻的定位能力，并通过新的采样策略和传播方法提高了跟踪稳定性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种统一框架，解决了视频目标分割中的时序推理和细粒度视觉理解问题，并进行了联合优化。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的多模态RLVR优化策略，称为视觉感知策略优化（VPPO），通过重新权衡轨迹的优势并专注于感知关键的Token，从而显著提升LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

TL;DR: CapGeo提升了MLLMs在几何推理领域的能力，通过将图形转为字幕进行跨模态推理，并通过CapGeo-Bench数据集评估其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于几何问题主要在于对图形理解的困难，而非推理能力本身，因此通过将几何图形转化为文本描述被认为是改善MLLMs几何推理能力的有效途径。

Method: 引入CapGeo，一个助力模型进行视觉与文本模态融合推理的框架，并开发了一个评估数据集CapGeo-Bench。CapGeo通过将视觉内容转化为图像字幕来改善模型的几何推理能力。该评估数据集使用关键点评估指标来测试几何字幕化能力。

Result: 通过实验，配备字幕的模型在几何推理任务中的表现有显著提升。具体来说，Qwen2.5-VL-72B的正确率从仅仅依赖视觉的8.6%提高到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提高到73.0%。

Conclusion: CapGeo和CapGeo-Bench为提高MLLMs的几何推理能力提供了新的方向。通过引入视觉与文本模态桥接的CapGeo框架，以及高质量几何字幕化模型的评估数据集CapGeo-Bench，显著提升了MLLMs在几何问题上的表现。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新颖的基于流匹配的生成框架RadioFlow，用于快速生成高保真无线电图。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

TL;DR: 提出了Hybrid-depth框架，通过基础模型增强语义-空间信息提取，解决了单目深度估计中的性能限制问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而导致性能受限。为了解决这一问题，提出了一种新框架来集成基础模型以提取视觉先验并获取充分的上下文信息。

Method: 本文提出了一种粗细渐进的学习框架：首先，利用CLIP和DINO提取多尺度语义与空间细节，通过对比语言指引强制进行深度感知特征对齐；然后，在粗特征的基础上，整合相机位置信息进行像素级语言对齐以优化深度预测。该模块可以无缝集成到现有自监督MDE管线中，作为即插即用的深度编码器。

Result: 通过集成CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，并结合语言指引，该方法有效解决了特征粒度不匹配的问题。实验表明其在KITTI基准上显著优于现有SOTA方法，并惠及诸如BEV感知这样的下游任务。

Conclusion: Hybrid-depth方法能够有效解决当前MDE方法中存在的语义-空间信息提取不足的问题，它通过集成基础模型来获取视觉先验和上下文信息，显著提升了深度估计性能。实验结果表明，该方法在所有指标上均优于现有SOTA方法，同时也促进了下游任务效果。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统的多模态方法在处理缺乏和未见场景时存在显著限制，同时现有基准中训练测试的重叠导致模型能力被高估。为此，提出了使用VLM进行多模态关键短语预测来解决这些问题。

Method: 使用视觉-语言模型进行MMKP任务，通过零样本和监督微调评估VLM的性能，并采用Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT策略来改进VLM的推理能力。

Result: 通过在多个数据集上的评估，实验结果证明了所提出的方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法在各种数据集上效果显著，展示了在MMKP任务中改进VLM推理能力的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

Motivation: 目前的推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理能力，并且往往将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，作者引入了一个专注于视觉内容推理的新基准。

Method: 提出了BLINK-Twice，一个新的视觉中心推理基准，用于测试现有MLLMs的视觉推理能力。

Result: 经过对20种领先的多模态大型语言模型的评估，发现BLINK-Twice对现有模型提出了显著挑战，尽管一些语言空间的推理策略可以改善性能，但通常会导致不稳定和冗余的推理。反复的图像观察提高了模型的表现，并且主动的视觉交互表明需要一种新的视觉推理范式。

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice基准展示了现有多模态大型语言模型在视觉中心推理任务中的挑战性，并强调了视觉推理新范式的必要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS方法在高度动态的城市环境中会出现几何结构失真的问题，亟需一种有效的方法来填补初始点云不足的问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于体素可见性推理的多视角选择和基于补丁匹配的多视角立体重建方法，旨在恢复缺失的结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的广泛实验表明，VAD-GS在静态和动态对象的重建质量方面均优于最先进的3DGS方法。

Conclusion: VAD-GS显著提升了在复杂城市场景中重建几何结构的质量，优于现有的3DGS方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 在视觉任务中使用基于转换器的模型进行高效推断仍然是一个挑战，尤其是在目标检测方面。我们分析了DETR的MLP层中的固有稀疏性，介绍了两种方法来利用这种稀疏性而无需重新训练。

Method: 首先，我们提出了静态指示器稀疏化（SIBS），这是一种基于固定激活模式预测神经元不活动的启发式方法。其次，我们介绍了微门控稀疏化（MGS），它是一种在预训练DETR之上训练的轻量级门控机制，通过一个小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: MGS实现了高达85%至95%的激活稀疏性。在COCO数据集上的实验表明，MGS在显著减少计算量的同时保持了甚至提高了性能。

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，使得在无需完全重新训练模型的情况下，可以高效地部署预训练的视觉转换器。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 低光照视频增强面临噪声、低对比度和色彩退化的挑战。当前的学习型方法虽然推理速度快，但在真实低光照场景中依然难以应对严重的噪声问题，主要原因在于未能有效利用时间信息。

Method: 提出了一种新的两阶段框架DWTA-Net，通过短期和长期的时间线索联合利用，解决了低光视频增强中的问题。第一阶段采用视觉状态空间块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构并保持局部一致性。第二阶段引入动态权重的时间聚合模块，通过光流引导进行循环细化，自适应平衡静态和动态区域。使用纹理自适应损失进一步保留细节并在平坦区域促进平滑。

Result: 实验表明，DWTA-Net在真实低光照视频中能有效抑制噪声和伪影，提供比现有方法更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合利用短期和长期的时间线索，成功解决了低光照视频增强中的噪声问题，且在保留细节和提供卓越视觉质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: SilvaScenes数据集解决了复杂森林环境中机器人感知系统开发的挑战，提升了树种实例分割能力，但物种分类仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂自然环境中的感知问题影响了森林管理机器人的发展，且现有数据集在物种数量和环境复杂性方面存在不足，本文旨在提供解决方案。

Method: 利用现代深度学习方法进行实例分割基准测试，以评估SilvaScenes数据集的挑战性和相关性。

Result: SilvaScenes数据集使树的分割变得简单，其最好的mAP达到了67.65%，但物种分类仍然具有挑战性，mAP仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个名为SilvaScenes的新数据集，以解决现有数据集不足以开发复杂自然环境中的机器人感知系统的问题。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

*Jisu Han,Wonjun Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种通过最大化维度熵来改善视觉-语言模型在实际应用中可靠性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视觉-语言模型(VLM)中发现由于跨模态的单一主导特征维度导致的模态间隙，对此进行研究以改善模型在测试时的表现。

Method: 提出最大化维度熵的方法，通过令文本特征分布趋向于均匀以减少单一主导维度对校准错误的影响。

Result: 约束主导维度的影响可以改善校准错误，而所提的方法有效解决了测试时提示微调的性能下降问题，提高了视觉-语言模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过最大化维度熵来正则化文本特征的分布，从而减轻主导维度的影响。这有效缓解了测试时提示微调中的校准性能退化问题，提升了视觉-语言模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于DreamBooth的多token策略，用于生成无限制的新角色，保留艺术风格，评估结果显示其生成效果优秀。

Motivation: 生产几乎无限数量的新角色，同时保留少量人类设计参考角色的艺术风格和共同视觉特征，从而扩大动画、游戏及相关领域的创造力。

Method: 我们的解决方案基于DreamBooth，这是一个成熟的文本到图像扩散模型微调技术，并将其改进以解决两个核心挑战：捕捉超越文本提示所需的复杂角色细节和训练数据的少量特性。为此，我们提出了一种多token策略，利用聚类将不同的token分配给单个角色及其整体风格，并结合LoRA-based参数高效微调。

Result: 我们的结果表明，该方法能够生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保留参考角色的独特审美特征。且人类评估进一步加强了其效果，并突出了我们方法的潜力。

Conclusion: 通过去除特定类别的正则化集，并在生成过程中引入随机tokens和嵌入，我们的方法能够无限制地生成角色，同时保留已学习的风格。评估结果显示该方法能够生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保留参考角色的独特审美特征。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

TL;DR: 研究提出了评价医学图像分割算法的新方法和软件框架，通过实验发现模型鲁棒性受交互信息完整性、自适应缩放、交互一致性及上下文环境的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前在医学图像分割领域中，分割算法的评价不够一致或符合临床实际，影响了算法的真实表现。因此，研究旨在提出一种临床合理的方法来定义评价任务和指标，通过构建软件框架来标准化评估流程，便于对算法进行公平比较。

Method: 提出了一种临床合理的方法来定义医学图像分割算法的评价任务和指标，并构建了一个软件框架来生成标准化的评估流程。随后使用该框架对现有的优秀算法进行了评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，减少处理用户交互时的信息丢失、采用自适应缩放机制、训练和验证的交互行为一致性以及使用3D上下文对于提高算法性能至关重要。另外，非医学领域的模型在低对比度和复杂形状时表现较差。

Conclusion: 从实验结果可以看出，保持信息交互的完整性和一致性是提高模型鲁棒性的重要因素，同时自适应缩放机制可以加快收敛速度，而3D上下文对于处理大型或形状复杂的目标非常重要，强调整合实际临床需求以优化算法性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了PhysToolBench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型对物理工具的理解能力，发现了模型在工具理解方面的不足，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型虽然在具身智能和视觉-语言-动作模型中展现了高层次的规划能力，但其对物理工具的理解程度尚未被量化评估。为解决这一问题，作者设计了PhysToolBench，以评估模型对物理工具的理解能力并提出改进方向。

Method: 使用者提出了一个名为PhysToolBench的基准测试，它是一个视觉问答数据集，包含超过1000个图像-文本配对，用于评估模型在不同难度层面的能力，包括工具识别、工具理解及工具创造。通过对32个多模态大语言模型的全面评估，验证了这些模型在工具理解上的不足。

Result: 通过PhysToolBench的基准测试，研究者发现32个多模态大语言模型在工具理解能力上普遍存在不足。这一测试揭示了这些模型在工具识别、操作原理理解以及工具创造方面的挑战。此外，作者提供了解决这些问题的初步方案。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在物理工具理解方面的显著不足。尽管它们具备高层次规划能力，但在具体工具理解与应用上仍存在较大差距。作者通过PhysToolBench基准测试验证了这一问题，并提出了初步解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究动机是提高PRNU指纹验证的可靠性，尤其针对三星智能手机拍摄的图像所存在的特定伪影对验证过程的影响。

Method: 作者首先通过实验分析了Galaxy S系列和一些Galaxy A系列机型之间指纹的相似性，然后通过使用支持“专业模式”的设备进行验证，发现“原始图像”不受伪影的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，Galaxy S系列和Galaxy A系列机型存在指纹碰撞问题，但使用支持“专业模式”且具备“原始图像”功能的设备进行PRNU验证仍然可靠。此外，作者还提出对角线伪影在HDR图像检测和人像模式中合成景深区分中的潜在法医应用。

Conclusion: 文章提出了一些三星智能手机中拍摄图像的对角线伪影会导致PRNU指纹验证失败的问题，并探讨了解决之道。作者发现“专业模式”和“原始图像”可以避免伪影影响，同时分析了对角线伪影可能的法医应用。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: FSP-DETR是一种统一检测框架，在生物医学中支持少样本检测、开放集识别及未见任务泛化，表现优于以往方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学环境中的物体检测面临标注数据稀缺及新类别频繁出现的限制，故需要一种能支持少样本检测、开放集识别及未见任务泛化的统一检测框架。

Method: FSP-DETR是一种基于DETR的统一检测框架，通过构建类原型、使用轻量级变压器解码器学习嵌入空间，训练过程中优化原型匹配损失、基于对齐的分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Result: 引入了新的卵种检测基准并建立评估协议，实验表明FSP-DETR在卵、血细胞及疟疾检测任务中优于以往的少样本和原型检测器。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR在低标注情况下实现了鲁棒的少样本检测、开放集识别以及对未见生物医学任务的一般化。其实验结果表明，在低样本和开放集情境下表现优异，显著优于之前的方法。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Method: 使用标题和摘要的标准化处理、短语保护以及与手工制作的词汇表进行匹配，分配最多35个主题标签并挖掘关于任务、架构、训练制度、目标、数据集及共同提及的模态的细粒度线索。

Result: 分析表明多模态视觉语言LLM工作增多，生成方法扩展以及3D和视频活动的韧性发展。并展示跨会比较，CVPR在3D领域占据更强位置，ICLR则在VLM中拥有最高份额。

Conclusion: 该论文通过透明且可重复的方式测量了2023年至2025年间在CVPR、ICLR和NeurIPS上被接受的26,104篇论文的研究趋势。归纳出三个宏观变化：多模态视觉语言LLM工作显著增加；生成方法稳步扩展；3D和视频活动具有韧性发展。

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on

Method: 通过一个简单而有效的基于蒸馏的框架，将预训练的小型动作模型的知识转移到VLMs中，体系结构保留了原有的VLM结构，只增加了动作标记和状态编码器以整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO测试中，方法的平均成功率提高了11.8%，在LIBERO-LONG中提高了24.5%。于五项真实任务中，成功率达82.0%，提升了17%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个基于蒸馏的框架，有效地赋予视觉语言模型（VLMs）执行动作的能力，与以往方法相比，大幅提升了成功率，同时显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM is introduced to improve real-time vision-language model performance on infinite video streams, maintaining low latency and memory usage, and showing strong results on new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the challenges faced by vision-language models in understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage.

Method: StreamingVLM uses a unified framework aligning training with streaming inference, maintaining a compact KV cache, and employing a simple supervised fine-tuning strategy with full attention on short, overlapped video chunks.

Result: StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS. It also enhances VQA abilities, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

Conclusion: StreamingVLM successfully addresses the challenge of real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input and shows improved performance on benchmarks without VQA-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

Motivation: 该研究旨在解决在生物医学命名实体识别（BioNER）任务中基因和化学物质等相似实体类型之间的区分困难，意在通过改进识别模型提取科学文献中的信息。

Method: 该研究评估了GLiNER-BioMed模型，并引入了以字典为基础的后处理策略来解决常见的错误分类问题。研究还探讨了条件随机场等替代方法。

Result: 字典为基础的后处理策略在开发集上将微F1得分从0.79提升到0.83，但在盲测试集上未能展示同样的改进，微F1得分为0.77。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了字典优化预训练BioNER模型的潜力，但也强调了对开发数据过拟合的挑战以及保证在真实世界中的泛化能力的必要性。

Abstract: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in
large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial
for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as
distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This
study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a
targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common
misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable
improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a
baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test
set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared
to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring
alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work
highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER
models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development
data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world
applicability.

Motivation: 研究TTS在候选多样性减少时产生不安全输出的倾向，希望促使未来设计能够抵御多样性针对性压力测试的稳健TTS策略。

Method: 提出了一个参考引导的多样性减少协议（RefDiv），并通过该协议对四个开源模型和两种常用的TTS策略进行广泛实验。

Result: 约束候选多样性显著增加了TTS产生不安全结果的频率，且这种现象在不同的TTS策略和闭源模型中均有体现。

Conclusion: 现有的安全防护措施无法有效检测由RefDiv生成的对抗性输入提示，这表明需要开发更稳健的测试时间扩展策略。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple
candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A
tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance
reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a
previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed,
even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe
outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv)
that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through
extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1,
Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and
Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS
produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by
prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon
also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI
o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant
property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find
that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and
OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts
generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited
protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we
hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are
both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as
illustrated by RefDiv.

### [79] [Hierarchical Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Depression Detection from Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08593)
*Yuxin Li,Eng Siong Chng,Cuntai Guan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音的抑郁症检测新方法HAREN-CTC，通过整合多层SSL特征以及跨注意力培训，实现了当前最优的检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的临床评估方法具有侵入性，基于语音的抑郁症检测作为非侵入性替代方案具有很大的潜力，但面临着有效特征提取和时间上稀疏、异构的抑郁线索捕捉的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为HAREN-CTC的新颖架构，采用多任务学习框架内的跨注意力来整合多层SSL特征，并结合连接时序分类损失处理稀疏时间监督。HAREN-CTC由两个关键模块组成：层次自适应聚类模块和跨模态融合模块，前者将SSL特征重组为互补嵌入，后者通过跨注意力建模层间依赖关系。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上实现了0.81的宏F1分数，在MODMA数据集上实现了0.82的宏F1分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的HAREN-CTC方法可以有效整合多层SSL特征，进行时间上的对齐感知训练，在抑郁症检测任务中表现出了领先的性能。

Abstract: Speech-based depression detection (SDD) is a promising, non-invasive
alternative to traditional clinical assessments. However, it remains limited by
the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse,
heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning
(SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations,
yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a
single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets
and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle
and persistent depression signals.
  To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that
integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask
learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to
handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a
Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into
complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models
inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables
alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal
patterns of depressive speech cues.
  We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data
splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation. The model
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1-scores of 0.81 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.82 on
MODMA, outperforming prior methods across both evaluation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mnemosyne是一种为边缘设备设计的长时记忆架构，在纵向健康对话中表现出色，超过了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLM内存系统在边缘设备上性能受限，因此需要构建一个能在边缘设备上工作的长时记忆架构。

Method: Mnemosyne采用图结构化存储、模块化过滤器、记忆提交和修剪机制，以及概率性回忆和时间衰减刷新过程。

Result: Mnemosyne在人类评估的现实性和长时记忆能力中获得了65.8%的胜率，超越了基准RAG的31.1%。

Conclusion: Mnemosyne架构在长时对话中的表现优于现有的检索增强方法，在纵向健康对话中实现了显著的现实和长时记忆能力提升。

Abstract: Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However,
current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force
context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained
devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term
memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses
graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory
committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay
and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a
concentrated "core summary" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of
the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific
long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example,
post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing
retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal
healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally
distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with
longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate
of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability
compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current
highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval
compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score
of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and
OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall,
enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be
feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory
architecture.

TL;DR: Confidence Score减轻了传统度量的创意性偏见，更有效评估创意文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的参考度量，如自困惑度，对创意文本生成有强烈的偏见。需要一种偏见更小的方法。

Method: 通过模型的输出概率分布得出Confidence Score (CS)。 在gpt-4o-mini的实验中使用CS与流畅性度量进行比较，展示在不同难度任务中的有效性。

Result: 与传统的基于流畅性的度量相比，CS能够更有效地识别创意性文本生成（19%对比0%），并且区分不同任务难度。

Conclusion: Confidence Score (CS)提供了一种比传统流畅性度量更平衡的评估方法，可以通过有意义的统计显著性来评估创意性文本生成。

Abstract: Reference-free metrics like self-perplexity are strongly biased against
creative text generation. We propose the Confidence Score (CS), derived from a
model's output probability distribution, as a less biased alternative.
Experiments on gpt-4o-mini show that while fluency-based metrics prefer novel
responses in 0\% of cases on 99 creative prompts, our CS does so 19% of the
time, a statistically significant difference (95% CI for difference: [11.1%,
27.3%]). We also show that CS effectively distinguishes between easy, medium,
and hard tasks, confirmed by non-overlapping confidence intervals. The
Confidence Score thus mitigates the creativity bias of traditional metrics
while retaining their core evaluative strengths, offering a more balanced
assessment for modern LLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype
conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations
in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery
for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering
model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper
model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and
dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA
uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective
layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model.
We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small
language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures,
multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several
evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model
accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.

Conclusion: 本文在多轮对话中使用务实模型，展示了如何减少二义性并提高代码准确性，从而更好地匹配用户目标。

Abstract: Establishing shared goals is a fundamental step in human-AI communication.
However, ambiguities can lead to outputs that seem correct but fail to reflect
the speaker's intent. In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the
data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the
generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on
the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows
for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop
a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to
quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we
demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations
than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can
reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user
goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies:
Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under
Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce
ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn
exchanges in code generation.

Motivation: 现有的检测方法在跨领域和模型上的泛化能力较差，因此需要重新构思检测任务的分类方式，认为二元分类方法无法准确捕捉人类文本的多样性。

Method: 使用了一类学习方法包括DeepSVDD和HRN，以及基于得分的学习技术如基于能量的方法进行检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了OOD方法的有效性，尤其是在DeepFake数据集上，获得了98.3%的AUROC和AUPR，并且FPR95仅为8.9%。同时在多语言、攻击以及未见过的模型和领域文字设置中展示了该框架的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的基于OOD的检测框架，将人类撰写的文本视为分布异常值，而机器生成的文本是分布内样本。实验验证了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT,
DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated
text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable
detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated
content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers
largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often
leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we
argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the
detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In
reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their
diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes
previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn
the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen
human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the
detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating
human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts
are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework
using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based
learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and
generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the
OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake
dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked,
and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and
generalizability of our framework. Code, pretrained weights, and demo will be
released.

TL;DR: YpathRAG enhances LLM performance in pathology by improving retrieval accuracy and reliability through a novel framework and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models tend to hallucinate in specialized domains like pathology. This paper aims to address this issue by improving evidence-based information retrieval without relying on domain-specific fine-tuning.

Method: The paper introduces YpathRAG, a pathology-oriented RAG framework utilizing a dual-channel hybrid retrieval system combining dense retrieval (BGE-M3) and sparse retrieval guided by vocabulary.

Result: YpathRAG achieved significant performance improvements in retrieval tasks, with a Recall@5 of 98.64% on YpathR and increased accuracy by an average of 9.0% on YpathQA-M benchmark.

Conclusion: YpathRAG demonstrates improved retrieval quality and factual reliability in pathology-focused tasks, suggesting that it provides a scalable and interpretable approach for enhancing domain-specific applications of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel on general tasks yet still hallucinate in
high-barrier domains such as pathology. Prior work often relies on domain
fine-tuning, which neither expands the knowledge boundary nor enforces
evidence-grounded constraints. We therefore build a pathology vector database
covering 28 subfields and 1.53 million paragraphs, and present YpathRAG, a
pathology-oriented RAG framework with dual-channel hybrid retrieval (BGE-M3
dense retrieval coupled with vocabulary-guided sparse retrieval) and an
LLM-based supportive-evidence judgment module that closes the
retrieval-judgment-generation loop. We also release two evaluation benchmarks,
YpathR and YpathQA-M. On YpathR, YpathRAG attains Recall@5 of 98.64%, a gain of
23 percentage points over the baseline; on YpathQA-M, a set of the 300 most
challenging questions, it increases the accuracies of both general and medical
LLMs by 9.0% on average and up to 15.6%. These results demonstrate improved
retrieval quality and factual reliability, providing a scalable construction
paradigm and interpretable evaluation for pathology-oriented RAG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有的越狱攻击能够通过困惑度过滤被检测到的问题，提出一种新的白盒越狱攻击方法。

Method: LatentBreak通过在输入提示中替换与原意相同的单词，并通过最小化潜在空间中对抗提示与无害请求之间的表示距离来达到目的。

Result: 在多个安全对齐模型上，LatentBreak在困惑度过滤方面的表现优于现有的越狱算法。

Conclusion: LatentBreak能够生成短且低困惑度的对抗性提示词，能够有效规避基于困惑度的过滤机制。

Abstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety
mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an
adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to
generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we
show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock
the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based
filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak,
a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with
low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words
in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial
intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or
long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent
space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless
requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and
low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms
against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情绪识别在对话中具有挑战性，因为辨别性证据稀缺、局部化，并且在模态之间往往不同步。

Method: 提出了一个统一模型，通过检测文本、音频和视频中的每个话语热点，使用Hotspot-Gated Fusion进行融合，并通过路由的Mixture-of-Aligners进行模态对齐，同时通过跨模态图编码对话结构。

Result: 在标准的情绪识别基准测试中，实验显示出对强基线的持续性提升，且消融实验确认了HGF和MoA的贡献。

Conclusion: 情绪识别中的热点中心视角可以为未来的多模态学习提供新的见解，对情绪识别中的模态融合提出了新的观点。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is hard because discriminative
evidence is sparse, localized, and often asynchronous across modalities. We
center ERC on emotion hotspots and present a unified model that detects
per-utterance hotspots in text, audio, and video, fuses them with global
features via Hotspot-Gated Fusion, and aligns modalities using a routed
Mixture-of-Aligners; a cross-modal graph encodes conversational structure. This
design focuses modeling on salient spans, mitigates misalignment, and preserves
context. Experiments on standard ERC benchmarks show consistent gains over
strong baselines, with ablations confirming the contributions of HGF and MoA.
Our results point to a hotspot-centric view that can inform future multimodal
learning, offering a new perspective on modality fusion in ERC.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在非西方国家尤其是资源有限的环境中，在多模态理解和推理方面表现下降。为了解决这一问题并提高大型语言模型在亚洲环境中的文化意识，该研究设计了一个评估框架。

Result: 通过比较模型分析、注意力追踪和使用VPR方法，研究探索了为何模型在语言和模态之间发生分歧，并提供了建立文化可靠的多模态语言模型的实用见解。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个名为MMA-ASIA的框架，用于评估大型语言模型在亚洲环境中的文化意识。这一框架不仅提供了一个多语种、多模态的基准，还将输入在文本、图像和语音三个模态上进行对齐，以测试跨模态迁移能力。从分析结果中可以得出关于如何构建更加可靠的文化多模态语言模型的实用见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used worldwide, yet their multimodal
understanding and reasoning often degrade outside Western, high-resource
settings. We propose MMA-ASIA, a comprehensive framework to evaluate LLMs'
cultural awareness with a focus on Asian contexts. MMA-ASIA centers on a
human-curated, multilingual, and multimodally aligned multiple-choice benchmark
covering 8 Asian countries and 10 languages, comprising 27,000 questions; over
79 percent require multi-step reasoning grounded in cultural context, moving
beyond simple memorization. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset aligned
at the input level across three modalities: text, image (visual question
answering), and speech. This enables direct tests of cross-modal transfer.
Building on this benchmark, we propose a five-dimensional evaluation protocol
that measures: (i) cultural-awareness disparities across countries, (ii)
cross-lingual consistency, (iii) cross-modal consistency, (iv) cultural
knowledge generalization, and (v) grounding validity. To ensure rigorous
assessment, a Cultural Awareness Grounding Validation Module detects "shortcut
learning" by checking whether the requisite cultural knowledge supports correct
answers. Finally, through comparative model analysis, attention tracing, and an
innovative Vision-ablated Prefix Replay (VPR) method, we probe why models
diverge across languages and modalities, offering actionable insights for
building culturally reliable multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: GraphGhost可用于分析和干预LLMs的推理结构。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities,
yet the structural mechanisms underlying these abilities remain under explored.
In this work, we introduce GraphGhost, a unified framework that represents
neuron activations and their signal propagation as graphs, explaining how LLMs
capture structural semantics from sequential inputs and generate outputs
through structurally consistent mechanisms. This graph-based perspective
enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the
properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning
behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons
within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing
that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both
logical flow and semantic understanding. Together, these contributions position
GraphGhost as a powerful tool for analyzing, intervening in, and ultimately
understanding the structural foundations of reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究表明，性别偏见可能影响大型语言模型在医疗中的应用。需要检查LLM在性别分配上的一致性，以确保可靠和公平的临床决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗中的应用增加，关注其可能复制或放大性别相关偏见变得非常重要。鉴于性别长期以来影响医生行为和患者结果，需要确保LLM在承担类似人类角色（如临床医生或医学教育者）时不引入额外的偏倚。

Method: 使用来自《新英格兰医学杂志挑战》（NEJM）的案例研究，分配了性别（女性、男性或未指定）给多个开源和专有LLM，并评估LLM性别分配对应的诊断一致性和模型对患者性别的临床相关性或必要性的判断。

Result: 虽然大多数模型在不同LLM性别之间的诊断结果相对一致，但在患者性别的相关性和必要性判断上，所有模型在LLM性别之间表现出显著的不一致性，尤其是在相关性判断上。一些模型甚至在患者性别解释上显示出系统性的女性-男性差异。

Conclusion: 该研究表明大型语言模型（LLM）在性别分配上表现出了显著的不一致性，尤其是在判断患者性别的相关性上。这种未充分探索的偏见可能会影响LLM在临床实践中的可靠性。

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into healthcare holds promise
to enhance clinical decision-making, yet their susceptibility to biases remains
a critical concern. Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient
outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as
clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related
biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge
(NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple
open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency
across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models'
judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our
findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most
models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based
diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM
genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a
systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender.
These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the
reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine
checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure
reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.

Motivation: 现有数学文字题数据集往往忽略了具有干扰或过多信息的题目，这使得大型语言模型在这些条件下性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: 我们设计了一种利用LLMs自动生成干扰条件的迭代框架，能够在保持原问题的解决方案不变的情况下，生成具有干扰条件的数学文字题，减少了生成高质量数据集的劳动强度。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the
intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs)
represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets
contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or
excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that
popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting
conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting
conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context
expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect
and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these
datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning
process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and
rewrite solutions.
  To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs
to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts
to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the
creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for
further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of
shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are
explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original
solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is
efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to

*Juan Miguel Navarro Carranza*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过对基准题目的改写来测试语言模型的泛化能力，发现改写后模型的准确性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的基准得分可能由于记忆测试项目或接近重复项而被夸大。

Method: 提出了一种简单的协议，通过重新评估模型在改写后的基准问题上的表现来测试其泛化能力。

Result: 使用Mistral-7B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct测量了原始项目和改写项目之间的准确性差异，发现改写会导致模型准确性显著下降。

Conclusion: 研究发现，通过改写测试题目会导致模型的准确性显著下降，这与之前关于数据污染和模型依赖表面形式的担忧一致。

Abstract: Benchmark scores for Large Language Models (LLMs) can be inflated by
memorization of test items or near duplicates. We present a simple, protocol
that probes generalization by re-evaluating models on paraphrased versions of
benchmark questions. Using Mistral-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, we
measure the accuracy gap between original and paraphrased items on ARC-Easy and
ARC-Challenge. Our pipeline controls decoding, enforces multiple-choice output
format, and includes a robust paraphrase-cleaning step to preserve semantics.
We find that paraphrasing induces a non-trivial accuracy drop (original vs.
paraphrased), consistent with prior concerns about contamination and brittle
surface-form shortcuts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JAI-1是一个75B参数的泰语语言模型，通过扩展参数空间和整合泰语知识，表现优于其他泰语相关模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 最近的泰语模型主要依赖现有的开源模型，应用额外训练而没有结构修改来专门化泰语，这种方法可能在注入泰语特定信息时侵蚀模型参数空间中预先存在的知识，因为优化参数可能与新的语言要求相冲突。

Method: JAI-1从一个较小的高性能英语开源LLM开始，扩展其参数空间，并利用新分配的容量系统地整合泰语知识。预训练阶段接触了1.5万亿个tokens，包括超过3000亿个泰语语言tokens。随后进行监管型微调和对齐微调，使用超过60万条基于指令的示例。

Result: 在泰语相关的基准测试上性能优于Typhoon2-70B。

Conclusion: 最终模型在泰语相关的基准测试中表现优于Typhoon2-70B，验证了其扩展和知识集成框架的有效性。

Abstract: This technical report introduces JAI-1, a Thai-centric language model with
75B parameters. Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing
open-source models, applying additional training without structural
modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding
pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of
Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may
conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an
upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English
open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly
allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This
methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but
also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models,
enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed
to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by
post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using
more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated
superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks
(IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its
upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.

*Francesco Dente,Fabiano Dalpiaz,Paolo Papotti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Text2Stories用于评估自动生成的用户需求，基于LLM的技术在评估正确性和完整性上表现良好，增强了用户故事质量的衡量标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在软件需求生成过程中，评估自动生成的需求是否忠实反映了利益相关者的需求通常需要手动完成。本文提出了Text2Stories任务和度量标准，旨在通过文本到故事的匹配，量化需求（以用户故事的形式）与需求表达是否一致。

Method: 提出了Text2Stories任务和度量标准，将文本对齐任务分解为文本块与用户故事的匹配问题。实验使用四个数据集，采用一个基于LLM的匹配器进行测试，并与嵌入模型进行比较。

Result: 基于LLM的匹配器在测试集上达到了0.86的macro-F1分数，嵌入模型虽然表现不如基于LLM的模型，但仍能够进行有效的阻塞处理。本文的方法能够在不同用户故事集之间进行比较，增强了现有用户故事质量标准。

Conclusion: Text2Stories任务和度量标准为用户需求生成提供了一种可扩展、忠实于来源的补充，能够量化生成的用户故事与需求表达的一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be employed for automating the generation of
software requirements from natural language inputs such as the transcripts of
elicitation interviews. However, evaluating whether those derived requirements
faithfully reflect the stakeholders' needs remains a largely manual task. We
introduce Text2Stories, a task and metrics for text-to-story alignment that
allow quantifying the extent to which requirements (in the form of user
stories) match the actual needs expressed by the elicitation session
participants. Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our
metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the
transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at
least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the
alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over
four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out
annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective
blocking. Finally, we show how our metrics enable the comparison across sets of
stories (e.g., human vs. generated), positioning Text2Stories as a scalable,
source-faithful complement to existing user-story quality criteria.

*Nisar Ahmed,Muhammad Imran Zaman,Gulshan Saleem,Ali Hassan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，评估框架影响模型表现，致链式思维膨胀、仅回答合规性下降，准确性提升有限。提供了可复现的A/B框架和实际指导，确保基准改进反映可部署的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文的动机在于调查“评估气味”是否会在没有相应能力提升的情况下夸大测量性能。

Method: 使用单个开放权重模型（GPT-OSS-20B），运行六个配对的A/B场景，保持任务内容和解码固定，同时改变框架（评估导向与真实世界）和推理深度（中/高）：确定性数学、严格代码修复、引用生成、激励翻转（谨慎与能力）、链式思维可见性和多语言（乌尔都语）标题。通过确定性验证器计算准确性、仅回答合规性、犹豫/拒绝、链式思维（CoT）长度和架构合规性，带有预注册的变化和综合指数。

Result: 研究结果表明，评估框架可靠地膨胀了链式思维（数百到>1000字符），并减少了仅回答合规性，但对准确性的提升有限或不一致。在结构化输出中，它改善了包装，但对正则表达式验证的实质没帮助。而不同的激励措辞改善了错误组成，乌尔都语标题减少了较高推理深度下的准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，评估框架确实会影响模型的表现，导致链式思维膨胀和仅回答合规性下降，同时对准确性的提升有限或不一致。在结构化输出中，它提高了包装（例如，封闭块、列举列表）的质量，但对正则表达式验证的实质性内容没有帮助。不同的激励措辞重新调整了错误组成：赞美谨慎在高推理下略微提高了准确性并减少了错误但自信的错误，而赞美能力则产生简短但风险较大的输出。乌尔都语标题在较高推理深度时重现了这些特征，表明多语言平价风险。

Abstract: Benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) often rely on rubric-scented
prompts that request visible reasoning and strict formatting, whereas real
deployments demand terse, contract-bound answers. We investigate whether such
"evaluation scent" inflates measured performance without commensurate
capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six
paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying
framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High):
deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips
(caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers.
Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance,
hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with
pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation
framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces
answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In
structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated
lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error
composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and
reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser
but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can
decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity
risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators,
per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral
phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting,
confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark
gains reflect deployable capability.

TL;DR: 提出了利用小型语言模型（SLM）而非大型语言模型（LLM）优化推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨小型语言模型（SLM）在推荐系统中的潜力，以解决大型语言模型（LLM）在实际部署中的高推理成本问题。

Method: 提出了PULSE（偏好理解通过潜在语义嵌入），使用SLM生成的理由作为直接学习信号，并通过交互历史对其进行监督。

Result: PULSE通过实验验证，在多个基准数据集上性能优于现有模型，并且在跨域推荐和下游任务上具有良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: PULSE在跨域推荐和推理导向问答任务上表现优异，超过现有的ID、协同过滤和基于LLM的推荐模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities
through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world
deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models
(SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for
recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural
language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness
their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to
create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called
Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end
we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a
framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals,
supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions
(what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only
interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales
as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more
robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE
outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential
recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE
exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and
demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented
question answering. Our code is available

TL;DR: ExPO-HM通过引入解释驱动检测技术，提高了仇恨性迷因检测的准确性和可解释性，达到了最新的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于仇恨性迷因是一种复杂的在线滥用形式，现有检测方法无法提供所需的上下文和解释。需要一种更有效的检测系统来解决这些问题。

Method: ExPO-HM结合了SFT预热、具有课程学习的GRPO和条件决策熵（CDE）作为度量和奖励，用于推理质量。

Result: ExPO-HM在三个仇恨性迷因基准上实现了最先进的性能，在二元检测、细粒度分类和推理质量方面达到最高，分别比GRPO和DPO基线提高了15％和17％的F1分数。

Conclusion: ExPO-HM通过从简单的二进制警报转向解释驱动检测，提供准确、可解释和可操作的内容审核支持。

Abstract: Hateful memes have emerged as a particularly challenging form of online
abuse, motivating the development of automated detection systems. Most prior
approaches rely on direct detection, producing only binary predictions. Such
models fail to provide the context and explanations that real-world moderation
requires. Recent Explain-then-Detect approaches, using Chain-of-Thought
prompting or LMM agents, perform worse than simple SFT baselines, and even
advanced post-training methods such as GRPO fail to close the gap. Our analysis
identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such
as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely
explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning.
To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy
Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation
process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum
learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for
reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification,
and reasoning quality, with up to 15\% and 17\% F1 improvement over the GRPO
and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple
binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate,
interpretable, and actionable moderation support.

Motivation: 引入层次化的词汇表以实现带有详细语义的低级 token 到含有粗粒度意义的高级 token 的映射，从而优化语言建模过程。

Method: 提出了一种新的离散扩散模型，通过正向过程中根据调度器将每个 token 独立扰动到其高级祖先，反向过程中则逐步预测更详细的语义。并推导了扩散证据下界（ELBO）的闭式表达。

Conclusion: HDLM 提供了一种新的语言建模方法，通过层次化的语义尺度预测过程实现更好的生成效果。在文本生成实验中表现出比基准模型更低的验证和生成混淆度。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Hierarchical Diffusion Language Models (HDLM) -- a
novel family of discrete diffusion models for language modeling. HDLM builds on
a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are
surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the
forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level
ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the
reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed
semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic
scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form
expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM
can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a
special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the
insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of
HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative
perplexity than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏系统分析个人叙述风格选择的正式框架，研究提出一种新方法以形式化个人叙述中的风格，旨在揭示语言选择如何传达主观体验。

Method: 使用语言模型自动提取语言特征，如过程、参与者和环境，并将其与心理观察相结合，分析语言选择的顺序模式。

Result: 通过对数百个梦境叙述的分析，包括对一名患有创伤后压力障碍的战争老兵的个案研究，揭示了语言选择和心理状态的关系，尤其是动词过程对心理过程的支配。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言选择和心理状态之间存在关系，尤其是在创伤后压力障碍等特定情况下。通过对梦境叙述的分析，揭示了个人叙述中的独特语言模式。

Abstract: Personal narratives are stories authors construct to make meaning of their
experiences. Style, the distinctive way authors use language to express
themselves, is fundamental to how these narratives convey subjective
experiences. Yet there is a lack of a formal framework for systematically
analyzing these stylistic choices. We present a novel approach that formalizes
style in personal narratives as patterns in the linguistic choices authors make
when communicating subjective experiences. Our framework integrates three
domains: functional linguistics establishes language as a system of meaningful
choices, computer science provides methods for automatically extracting and
analyzing sequential patterns, and these patterns are linked to psychological
observations. Using language models, we automatically extract linguistic
features such as processes, participants, and circumstances. We apply our
framework to hundreds of dream narratives, including a case study on a war
veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder. Analysis of his narratives
uncovers distinctive patterns, particularly how verbal processes dominate over
mental ones, illustrating the relationship between linguistic choices and
psychological states.

Motivation: 传统心理评估依赖于结构化的评分量表，无法捕捉被试自然语言中的丰富细节，因此研究旨在利用LLM的进展将质性数据纳入新的概念框架中。

Method: 研究结合使用LLM评分文本和传统评分量表，以抑郁症为案例进行开发和评估。

Result: 增强测试在保持的数据集上实现了统计学显著的测量精准度和准确性提升，LLM项目的信息增益相当于在原有19项测试中添加了6.3（真实数据）至16.0（合成数据）项。

Conclusion: 研究展示了一种新的心理评估方法，结合了LLM评分文本和传统评分量表项目，能够显著提高测量的精准度和准确性。

Abstract: Psychological assessments typically rely on structured rating scales, which
cannot incorporate the rich nuance of a respondent's natural language. This
study leverages recent LLM advances to harness qualitative data within a novel
conceptual framework, combining LLM-scored text and traditional rating-scale
items to create an augmented test. We demonstrate this approach using
depression as a case study, developing and assessing the framework on a
real-world sample of upper secondary students (n=693) and corresponding
synthetic dataset (n=3,000). On held-out test sets, augmented tests achieved
statistically significant improvements in measurement precision and accuracy.
The information gain from the LLM items was equivalent to adding between 6.3
(real data) and 16.0 (synthetic data) items to the original 19-item test. Our
approach marks a conceptual shift in automated scoring that bypasses its
typical bottlenecks: instead of relying on pre-labelled data or complex
expert-created rubrics, we empirically select the most informative LLM scoring
instructions based on calculations of item information. This framework provides
a scalable approach for leveraging the growing stream of transcribed text to
enhance traditional psychometric measures, and we discuss its potential utility
in clinical health and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管更多的开源dLLM模型出现，标准化且高效的推理框架仍然是广泛采用的限制因素。

Method: dInfer通过将推理流程分解为四个模块化组件，并为每个组件集成新算法和系统级优化，实现dLLM推理的效率提升。

Result: 在LLaDA-MoE上的输出质量没有损失的情况下，dInfer在HumanEval上每秒超过1100个tokens，在6个基准测试中平均每秒超过800个tokens。与Fast-dLLM相比，dInfer速度提高10倍，与最新vLLM推理引擎优化的AR模型相比速度提高2-3倍。

Conclusion: dInfer在不影响模型性能的情况下实现了显著的效率提升，实现了与现有的AR模型和快速dLLM系统相比的速度提升。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs, leveraging denoising-based generation
to enable inherent parallelism. Even more and more open-sourced dLLM models
emerge, yet their widespread adoption remains constrained by the lack of a
standardized and efficient inference framework. We present dInfer, an efficient
and extensible framework for dLLM inference. dInfer decomposes the inference
pipeline into four modular components-model, diffusion iteration manager,
decoding strategy, and KV-cache manager-and integrates novel algorithms for
each component alongside system-level optimizations. Through this combination
of algorithmic innovations and system enhancements, dInfer achieves substantial
efficiency gains without compromising output quality on LLaDA-MoE. At batch
size 1, it surpasses 1,100 tokens per second on HumanEval and averages over 800
tokens per second across six benchmarks on $8\times$ H800 GPUs. Compared to
prior systems, dInfer delivers $10\times$ speedup over Fast-dLLM while
maintaining similar model performance. Even compared with AR models (with a
comparable number of activation parameters and performance) QWen2.5-3B, which
is highly optimized with latest vLLM inference engine, dInfer still deliverers
$2$-$3\times$ speedup. The implementation of dInfer is open-sourced at

TL;DR: 研究分析了代码大型语言模型的扩展法则，确认代码需要更高的数据与参数比例，且Farseer法则准确性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于代码和自然语言之间的基本差异，如严格的语法，现有的扩展法则可能不直接适用于代码，需要进行分析和验证。

Method: 进行了117次实验，模型规模从0.2B到3.8B，训练数据量从2B到128B。实验拟合了Chinchilla法则和Farseer法则。

Result: Farseer法则比Chinchilla法则提供了更好的准确性；代码大型语言模型在模型规模上能够有效扩展；代码需要更高的数据与参数比例；混合实验表明自然语言在资源受限情况下有益，但在高计算预算下则可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 代码大型语言模型（LLMs）在软件工程中引起了变革，但目前的扩展法则主要针对自然语言进行分析，这些法则是否适用于代码尚不明确。研究表明，扩展法则在代码上的应用需要更高的数据与参数比例。

Abstract: Code Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing software engineering.
However, scaling laws that guide the efficient training are predominantly
analyzed on Natural Language (NL). Given the fundamental differences like
strict syntax between code and NL, it is unclear whether these laws are
directly applicable to code. To address this gap, we conduct the first
large-scale empirical study of scaling laws for code, comprising 117
experimental runs with model sizes from 0.2B to 3.8B and training tokens from
2B to 128B. We fit the Chinchilla law and the Farsser law. First, the results
show that the more expressive Farseer law offers greater accuracy. Second, the
analysis reveals that Code LLMs scale effectively with model size. Crucially,
code represents a more data-hungry regime, requiring a substantially higher
data-to-parameter ratio than NL. Finally, two additional sets of experiments on
code-NL mixtures show that NL benefits resource-constrained scenarios, but
becomes a detriment at higher compute budgets.

Motivation: LLM在处理复杂的、微妙的推理形式上的能力需要进一步调查。

Method: 提出一个分解过程用于识别案件之间重要区别的三阶段推理任务框架。该框架通过使用称为因素的事实谓词对案件建模，组织为法律知识层次结构，并定义可验证的规则来识别区别、分析其论证支持和评估其重要性。

Result: 虽然模型在表面推理（任务1）上取得了高准确率，但在层次推理（任务2：64.82%-92.09%）上的表现下降，并在综合分析（任务3：11.46%-33.99%）上崩溃。令人最惊讶的是，模型在不正确的回答上花费的计算资源普遍多于正确回答，表明“思考更长时间”并不总是意味着“思考更聪明”。

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种方法来进行复杂领域中LLM推理能力的精细分析，并揭示了必须解决的基本局限性，以构建稳健和可信赖的法律AI。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning is a cornerstone of U.S. legal practice, requiring
professionals to argue about a current case by drawing analogies to and
distinguishing from past precedents. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
shown remarkable capabilities, their proficiency in this complex, nuanced form
of reasoning needs further investigation. We propose a formal framework that
decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases
into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual
predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and
defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their
argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive
evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve
high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on
hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated
analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models
consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than
correct ones, suggesting that "thinking longer" does not always mean "thinking
smarter." Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM
reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations
that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.

Conclusion: 通过生成一个紧凑、多样且抗膨胀的基准测试（TC-Bench），发现即使是最先进的测试用例生成方法在TC-Bench上也只能达到约60%的排除率，揭示了其诊断能力的显著差距。

Abstract: Evaluating test cases automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
is a critical yet challenging task. Existing benchmarks suffer from high
computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over
rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What
is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error
space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish
them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as
finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of
this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong
codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required
for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal
to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard
problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select
maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of
competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse,
and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the
most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on
TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power. Our dataset is

### [105] [How Reliable is Language Model Micro-Benchmarking?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08730)
*Gregory Yauney,Shahzaib Saqib Warraich,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 微基准测试在排序模型时不如完整基准可靠，特别是当模型性能差异较小时，需要更多样本来提高一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型开发中时间和成本过高的问题，通过评估现有基准的小子集来进行微基准测试。

Method: 引入了一种微基准测试的元评估方法，通过分析模型在完整基准上的性能差异来判断微基准的排序能力。

Result: 在许多场景中发现，微基准无法像完整基准一样一致地排序模型。为了准确排序具有较小性能差异的模型对，通常需要选择多达250个样例，此时随机采样可与现有微基准方法相竞争。

Conclusion: 微基准测试在对模型进行排序时并不总是可靠，特别是在性能差异较小的情况下。为了提高排序一致性，需要选择更多的数据样本。

Abstract: Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost
of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing
benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as
the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently
than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that
the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking
which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function
of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can
determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark,
allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark
size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples;
we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5
points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In
order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we
show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random
sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When
comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25
examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to
be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark
users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency
and reliability.

Motivation: 探讨地理编码组合位置参考这一具有挑战性的设置，评估LLMs在地理空间数据方面的知识和推理能力。

Method: 提出一种基于LLM的策略进行地理编码组合位置参考。

Result: 较小的微调LLM在地理编码任务中表现出与大规模现成模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于LLM的方法可以改进地理编码的性能，一个经过微调的较小的LLM可以获得与更大的现成模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Geocoding is the task of linking a location reference to an actual geographic
location and is essential for many downstream analyses of unstructured text. In
this paper, we explore the challenging setting of geocoding compositional
location references. Building on recent work demonstrating LLMs' abilities to
reason over geospatial data, we evaluate LLMs' geospatial knowledge versus
reasoning skills relevant to our task. Based on these insights, we propose an
LLM-based strategy for geocoding compositional location references. We show
that our approach improves performance for the task and that a relatively small
fine-tuned LLM can achieve comparable performance with much larger
off-the-shelf models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在不同国家和语言中的广泛使用，需要理解和规范这些模型的多语言响应。

Method: 使用五个维度的评分标准和一个Judge LLM来评估不同前沿和领先的开源模型的响应。

Result: GPT-5在Consent & Autonomy和Harm Prevention & Safety类别中分别获得平均分3.56和4.73，是表现最好的模型，而Gemini 2.5 Pro在这些类别中表现最差，平均分为1.39和1.98。

Conclusion: GPT-5在多种语言环境下的各个类别中表现优异，而其他模型在语言和类别间表现出更大的不一致性。

Abstract: With LLM usage becoming widespread across countries, languages, and humanity
more broadly, the need to understand and guardrail their multilingual responses
increases. Large-scale datasets for testing and benchmarking have been created
to evaluate and facilitate LLM responses across multiple dimensions. In this
study, we evaluate the responses of frontier and leading open-source models in
five dimensions across low and high-resource languages to measure LLM accuracy
and consistency across multilingual contexts. We evaluate the responses using a
five-point grading rubric and a judge LLM. Our study shows that GPT-5 performed
the best on average in each category, while other models displayed more
inconsistency across language and category. Most notably, in the Consent &
Autonomy and Harm Prevention & Safety categories, GPT scored the highest with
averages of 3.56 and 4.73, while Gemini 2.5 Pro scored the lowest with averages
of 1.39 and 1.98, respectively. These findings emphasize the need for further
testing on how linguistic shifts impact LLM responses across various categories
and improvement in these areas.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应保留机制，在保持高性能的同时有效减少内存使用并提高处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer注意力机制在长序列情况下计算量过大的问题，优化内存消耗和处理速度。

Method: 使用自适应保留机制，通过伯努利门实现概率层级选择，结合硬混合/变分松弛进行训练，并在推理时通过简单的top-M规则强制执行。

Result: 在分类、抽取问答和长文档总结任务中，只保留30-50%的tokens能够保持>= 95%的完整模型性能，同时减少约35-45%的峰值内存使用，处理速度提高至约1.8倍。

Conclusion: 提出了一种适应性保留机制，能够在保持模型性能的同时减少内存使用，提高处理速度。

Abstract: Transformer attention scales quadratically with sequence length O(n^2),
limiting long-context use. We propose Adaptive Retention, a probabilistic,
layer-wise token selection mechanism that learns which representations to keep
under a strict global budget M. Retention is modeled with Bernoulli gates
trained via a Hard-Concrete/variational relaxation and enforced with a simple
top-M rule at inference, making the method differentiable and drop-in for
standard encoders. Across classification, extractive QA, and long-document
summarization, keeping only 30-50% of tokens preserves >= 95% of full-model
performance while cutting peak memory by ~35-45% and improving throughput by up
to ~1.8x. This architecture-agnostic approach delivers practical long-context
efficiency without modifying base attention or task heads.

Motivation: 尽管LLM表现出了先进的推理能力，但对其在一般中文语言环境中的全面评估仍然研究不足。为填补这一空白，提出了一种新的基准CCMOR，以评估LLM整合中文特定事实知识与多步逻辑推理的能力。

Method: 首先从现有QA数据集构建域平衡的种子集，然后开发一个LLM驱动的流水线，以生成基于事实单元链的多跳问题。为了确保生成数据集的质量，实施了一种人机循环验证系统，由领域专家系统验证和完善生成的问题。

Result: 检索增强生成策略显著缓解了知识差距，使得性能显著提升。通过CCMOR评估表明，现有的LLM在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续的限制。

Conclusion: 使用CCMOR进行评估，显示了最先进的LLM在处理长尾知识和执行知识密集型推理方面存在持续的限制。不过，通过检索增强生成策略显著缓解了这些知识差距，使性能显著提升。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced reasoning
capabilities, their comprehensive evaluation in general Chinese-language
contexts remains understudied. To bridge this gap, we propose Chinese
Commonsense Multi-hop Reasoning (CCMOR), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to integrate Chinese-specific factual knowledge with multi-step
logical reasoning. Specifically, we first construct a domain-balanced seed set
from existing QA datasets, then develop an LLM-powered pipeline to generate
multi-hop questions anchored on factual unit chains. To ensure the quality of
resulting dataset, we implement a human-in-the-loop verification system, where
domain experts systematically validate and refine the generated questions.
Using CCMOR, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating persistent
limitations in LLMs' ability to process long-tail knowledge and execute
knowledge-intensive reasoning. Notably, retrieval-augmented generation
substantially mitigates these knowledge gaps, yielding significant performance
gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大规模语言模型越来越多地被部署在处理敏感数据的多语言应用中，其规模和语言的多样性带来了重大隐私风险，故探讨语言结构如何影响隐私泄漏。

Method: 作者量化了六个语言指标，并评估了三种攻击向量：信息提取、反事实记忆和成员推断。

Result: 意大利语表现出最强的泄漏，而英语显示出较高的成员可分性。法语和西班牙语由于更高的形态复杂性则表现出更大的抵抗力。

Conclusion: 研究发现语言结构在隐私泄漏中起着重要作用，这表明在大规模语言模型的部署中需要语言感知的隐私保护机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across multilingual
applications that handle sensitive data, yet their scale and linguistic
variability introduce major privacy risks. Mostly evaluated for English, this
paper investigates how language structure affects privacy leakage in LLMs
trained on English, Spanish, French, and Italian medical corpora. We quantify
six linguistic indicators and evaluate three attack vectors: extraction,
counterfactual memorization, and membership inference. Results show that
privacy vulnerability scales with linguistic redundancy and tokenization
granularity: Italian exhibits the strongest leakage, while English shows higher
membership separability. In contrast, French and Spanish display greater
resilience due to higher morphological complexity. Overall, our findings
provide the first quantitative evidence that language matters in privacy
leakage, underscoring the need for language-aware privacy-preserving mechanisms
in LLM deployments.

Motivation: 现有的多轮越狱方法通常依赖启发式或临时的探索策略，无法深入了解语言模型的潜在弱点。对话模式与模型在危害类别上的脆弱性关系仍不清楚，我们旨在通过新的框架揭示这一关系并提高攻击效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreaking
attacks that exploit conversational context to bypass safety constraints
gradually. These attacks target different harm categories (like malware
generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches
(educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios).
Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc
exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model
weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model
vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose
Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation
patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue.
Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and
LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where
robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and
model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight
limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware
defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然质量估计（QE）重排序在句子级翻译中效果显著，但其在逐步兴起的文档级翻译领域应用尚未被广泛研究。因此，本文旨在探索和评估QE重排序在文档级翻译中的潜力。

Method: 在本文中，作者评估了各种学习和大型语言模型（LLM）为基础的质量估计（QE）指标在文档级翻译中的表现。在评估中，使用学习指标SLIDE和LLM指标GEMBA-DA，比较不同数量候选项时的BLEURT-20分数提高情况。

Result: 研究结果显示，在文档级翻译中，使用学习的质量估计指标SLIDE，BLEURT-20分数在仅有两个候选项时提升了+2.00，而在有32个候选项时提升了+5.09。同时，使用最佳LLM指标GEMBA-DA时，在相同条件下分数提升了+1.63和+4.30。在长文档的重排序中，选择32个候选项的情况下，SLIDE和GEMBA-DA分别提升了+2.34和+1.40。

Conclusion: 本文的研究表明，在文档级质量估计（QE）重排序中，使用最佳学习指标SLIDE和最佳大型语言模型指标GEMBA-DA，能够显著提高翻译质量。尤其是在选择候选翻译时，增加候选数量可以进一步提升分数，展示出文档级QE对于翻译质量的提升具有实际价值，同时运行成本较低。

Abstract: Quality estimation (QE) reranking is a form of quality-aware decoding which
aims to improve machine translation (MT) by scoring and selecting the best
candidate from a pool of generated translations. While known to be effective at
the sentence level, its application to the increasingly prominent domain of
document-level translation remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate QE
reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical
sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model
(LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE,
BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with
32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine
translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of
+1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink
with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34
(SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens).
These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with
minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has demonstrated substantial improvements in the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), exhibiting significant
applicability across various domains. Recent research has identified that
tokens within LLMs play distinct roles during reasoning tasks, categorizing
them into high-entropy reasoning tokens and low-entropy knowledge tokens. Prior
approaches have typically focused on restricting updates to indirectly
encourage exploration, yet they do not explicitly facilitate exploratory
behavior during the token generation stage itself. In this work, we introduce a
complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by
applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically,
our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively
encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens
to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate
various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within
reinforcement learning contexts. Empirical evaluations on several reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reasoning
performance of LLMs. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate recognition of biomedical named entities is critical for medical
information extraction and knowledge discovery. However, existing methods often
struggle with nested entities, entity boundary ambiguity, and cross-lingual
generalization. In this paper, we propose a unified Biomedical Named Entity
Recognition (BioNER) framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs). We first
reformulate BioNER as a text generation task and design a symbolic tagging
strategy to jointly handle both flat and nested entities with explicit boundary
annotation. To enhance multilingual and multi-task generalization, we perform
bilingual joint fine-tuning across multiple Chinese and English datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning-based entity selector that
filters incorrect or spurious predictions by leveraging boundary-sensitive
positive and negative samples. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets
and two unseen corpora show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance and robust zero-shot generalization across languages. The source

TL;DR: Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC) is proposed to improve large language model inference, outperforming existing methods with significant compression while directly utilizing anchor tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current context compression methods create a fundamental mismatch between training tasks and actual downstream tasks, weakening real-world usage capabilities.

Method: SAC selects anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value representations without using autoencoding.

Result: SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines and shows increasing advantages at higher compression ratios in experimental results.

Conclusion: SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios, demonstrating significant improvements in out-of-distribution evaluation.

Abstract: Context compression presents a promising approach for accelerating large
language model (LLM) inference by compressing long contexts into compact
representations. Current context compression methods predominantly rely on
autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress
contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to
acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a
fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge
from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial
for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel
method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture
that is equipped with this compression capability \textit{a priori}. Instead of
training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly
selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates
contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving
representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need
for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly
leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor
embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2)
bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture
information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC
consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various
compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves
1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing
advantages at higher compression ratios.

Abstract: We introduce and study artificial impressions--patterns in LLMs' internal
representations of prompts that resemble human impressions and stereotypes
based on language. We fit linear probes on generated prompts to predict
impressions according to the two-dimensional Stereotype Content Model (SCM).
Using these probes, we study the relationship between impressions and
downstream model behavior as well as prompt features that may inform such
impressions. We find that LLMs inconsistently report impressions when prompted,
but also that impressions are more consistently linearly decodable from their
hidden representations. Additionally, we show that artificial impressions of
prompts are predictive of the quality and use of hedging in model responses. We
also investigate how particular content, stylistic, and dialectal features in
prompts impact LLM impressions.

Method: SOP-Maze基准是通过真实的商业数据构建的，并且适应成为来自23个复杂SOP场景的397个任务。

Result: 实验表明几乎所有的先进模型在SOP-Maze上表现不佳，并揭示了三个主要的错误类别：路线盲点、对话脆弱性和计算错误。

Conclusion: 研究证明了当前最先进的语言模型在处理复杂标准操作程序任务时具有显著困难。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed as domain-specific
agents, many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their ability to follow
instructions and make decisions in real-world scenarios. However, business
scenarios often involve complex standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the
evaluation of LLM capabilities in such contexts has not been fully explored. To
bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world
business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP
scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root
System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and
Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex
branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models
struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three
key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures;
(ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and
(iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under
complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP
tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for
improving model capabilities. We have open-sourced our work on

Abstract: We study how open source communities describe participation and control
through version controlled governance documents. Using a corpus of 710 projects
with paired snapshots, we parse text into actors, rules, actions, and objects,
then group them and measure change with entropy for evenness, richness for
diversity, and Jensen Shannon divergence for drift. Projects define more roles
and more actions over time, and these are distributed more evenly, while the
composition of rules remains stable. These findings indicate that governance
grows by expanding and balancing categories of participation without major
shifts in prescriptive force. The analysis provides a reproducible baseline for
evaluating whether future AI mediated workflows concentrate or redistribute
authority.

Abstract: We introduce CAPC-CG, the Chinese Adaptive Policy Communication (Central
Government) Corpus, the first open dataset of Chinese policy directives
annotated with a five-color taxonomy of clear and ambiguous language
categories, building on Ang's theory of adaptive policy communication. Spanning
1949-2023, this corpus includes national laws, administrative regulations, and
ministerial rules issued by China's top authorities. Each document is segmented
into paragraphs, producing a total of 3.3 million units. Alongside the corpus,
we release comprehensive metadata, a two-round labeling framework, and a
gold-standard annotation set developed by expert and trained coders.
Inter-annotator agreement achieves a Fleiss's kappa of K = 0.86 on directive
labels, indicating high reliability for supervised modeling. We provide
baseline classification results with several large language models (LLMs),
together with our annotation codebook, and describe patterns from the dataset.
This release aims to support downstream tasks and multilingual NLP research in
policy communication.

*Jingyu Zhou,Lu Ma,Hao Liang,Chengyu Shen,Bin Cui,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARO enhances large language model training by dynamically adjusting loss according to difficulty, outperforming existing methods in both speed and quality of training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve reasoning ability in large language models by addressing limitations in existing GRPO-based RLVR methods, which focus disproportionately on certain difficulty levels.

Method: DARO dynamically adjusts the loss contribution for different difficulty groups based on the model's learning state, overcoming static weighting limitations in GRPO variants.

Result: DARO achieved superior performance compared to four leading baselines in experiments across six math benchmarks, showcasing faster convergence and better final results.

Conclusion: DARO outperforms existing RLVR methods by addressing the limitations of static weighting schemes, leading to faster convergence and better final performance in large language model training.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that reasoning
ability can be significantly enhanced through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has
emerged as the de facto approach for RLVR, inspiring numerous variants.
However, our mathematical analysis reveals that these methods are fundamentally
weighted variations of GRPO. We provide a unified view, demonstrating that
their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample
difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates
a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on
certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall
performance. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that
dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the
model's learning state. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,
Qwen2.5-Math-7B, and Llama3.1-8B show that DARO outperforms four leading
baselines across six math benchmarks, achieving significantly faster
convergence and superior final performance.

*Yutao Mou,Xiaoling Zhou,Yuxiao Luo,Shikun Zhang,Wei Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用LoRA进行拒绝训练可以实现性能保持的安全性对齐，成本低且不影响模型固有功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法需要进行计算成本高昂的搜索，以在安全关键和通用数据之间找到最佳比例来平衡安全性和整体性能，而这会带来高成本且收益有限。

Method: 使用LoRA拒绝训练方法进行性能保持的安全性对齐。这种方法通过理论和实验验证，以低秩子空间的安全性增强不干扰模型的固有能力。

Result: LoRA能够有效地将安全性解耦到模型的低秩子空间，使得安全增强与模型的固有变换空间基本正交。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，使用LoRA进行拒绝训练可以实现性能保持的安全性对齐，即使仅通过安全数据进行训练也能做到这一点。LoRA被证明是一种经济高效、性能保持的即插即用安全补丁。

Abstract: Safety alignment is essential for building trustworthy artificial
intelligence, yet it remains challenging to enhance model safety without
degrading general performance. Current approaches require computationally
expensive searches for the optimal proportion of safety-critical and
general-purpose data to balance safety and general performance, incurring high
costs with limited gains. In this work, we show that LoRA-based
Refusal-training enables performance-preserving safety alignment even when
trained solely on safety data, demonstrating that LoRA serves as
cost-efficient, performance-preserving, and plug-and-play safety patches.
Beyond empirical findings, we provide both theoretical and experimental
evidence that LoRA effectively decouples safety into a low-rank subspace
largely orthogonal to the model's intrinsic transformation space, ensuring that
safety enhancements do not interfere with inherent capabilities.

*Shengmin Piao,Jieun Lee,Sanghyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitE-SQL是一种轻量级、高效的Text-to-SQL框架，其性能与大型语言模型相当甚至更优，但使用的参数更少，适用于隐私敏感和资源有限的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来使用大型语言模型（LLMs）的方法虽然性能强大，但其对专有模型的依赖引发了关于部署可行性和数据隐私的关注。该工作的动机是克服这些挑战，提出一个轻量且高效的解决方案。

Method: 引入了一个名为LitE-SQL的轻量级框架，其中包括两个组件：一个进行高效模式链接的模式检索器和一个在两阶段微调的SQL生成器。这两阶段包括监督微调和执行指导下的强化学习。

Result: 在BIRD数据集上，LitE-SQL实现了72.10%的执行准确率，在Spider 1.0数据集上达到了88.45%的准确率，其性能与基于LLM的方法相当甚至更优，且参数数量减少了2倍到30倍。

Conclusion: 高质量的Text-to-SQL生成是可行的，即使在资源有限的情况下，并且可以为隐私敏感和资源受限的环境提供实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Text-to-SQL task translates natural language questions into SQL queries,
enabling intuitive database interaction for non-experts. While recent methods
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance, their
reliance on proprietary models raise concerns about deployment feasibility and
data privacy. In this work, we introduce LitE-SQL, a Lightweight and Efficient
framework with two components: (i) a Schema Retriever that performs efficient
schema linking using a vector database of pre-computed schema embeddings, and
(ii) a SQL Generator fine-tuned in two stages-supervised fine-tuning followed
by execution-guided reinforcement-enabling self-correction without costly
multi-candidate generation. On BIRD, LitE-SQL achieves 72.10% execution
accuracy, and on Spider 1.0 it reaches 88.45%, demonstrating comparable or
superior performance to LLM-based methods despite using 2x to 30x fewer
parameters. Our findings demonstrate that high-quality Text-to-SQL generation
is feasible with lightweight models, offering a practical solution for
privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: 研究探索了通过优化大型语言模型的评分细则来增强自动作文评分的效果，实验结果显示与人类评分的对齐性提高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于大型语言模型的性能对提示信号十分敏感，研究的动机是通过优化提示信号来提升自动作文评分的表现。

Method: 本研究采用了一种迭代优化的方法，促使语言模型通过对自身评分依据和与人类评分差异的反思来不断完善评分细则。

Result: 在TOEFL11和ASAP数据集的实验中，使用GPT-4.1、Gemini-2.5-Pro和Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct模型获得了显著的QWK提升，分别达到0.19和0.47。

Conclusion: 本研究表明，通过迭代优化评分细则，可以有效提高LLM在自动作文评分中的准确性，甚至可以超越人类编写的详细评分标准。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
prompts they are given. Drawing inspiration from the field of prompt
optimization, this study investigates the potential for enhancing Automated
Essay Scoring (AES) by refining the scoring rubrics used by LLMs. Specifically,
our approach prompts models to iteratively refine rubrics by reflecting on
models' own scoring rationales and observed discrepancies with human scores on
sample essays. Experiments on the TOEFL11 and ASAP datasets using GPT-4.1,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Qwen-3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct show Quadratic Weighted Kappa
(QWK) improvements of up to 0.19 and 0.47, respectively. Notably, even with a
simple initial rubric, our approach achieves comparable or better QWK than
using detailed human-authored rubrics. Our findings highlight the importance of
iterative rubric refinement in LLM-based AES to enhance alignment with human
evaluations.

TL;DR: 该研究针对Chakma语言开发了一个Bangla转写的语料库，通过微调多语言模型提升标记准确率，为资源稀缺语言的多语言建模提供了新的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于作为印度-雅利安语言的Chakma可用数据有限，因此在语言模型中仍然缺乏代表性。该研究旨在解决这一问题，通过构建Bangla转写的Chakma语料库，并验证其有效性。

Method: 在这项研究中，作者使用上下文连贯的Bangla转写Chakma语料库，通过六种编码器的多语言和区域Transformer模型（包括mBERT、XLM-RoBERTa、DistilBERT、DeBERTaV3、BanglaBERT和IndicBERT），在遮蔽语言建模任务上进行微调。

Result: 实验结果表明，针对Bangla转写Chakma进行微调的多语言模型在性能上优于其预训练版本，达到了高达73.54%的标记准确率和最低至2.90的困惑度。研究还指出，数据质量对模型性能的影响以及OCR对形态丰富的印度语系文字的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究证明，使用Bangla转写的Chakma可以有效地进行Chakma语言的迁移学习，并鼓励其他研究人员在多语言语言建模中使用这一手动验证的单语数据集，以促进对资源稀缺语言的深入研究。

Abstract: As an Indo-Aryan language with limited available data, Chakma remains largely
underrepresented in language models. In this work, we introduce a novel corpus
of contextually coherent Bangla-transliterated Chakma, curated from Chakma
literature, and validated by native speakers. Using this dataset, we fine-tune
six encoder-based multilingual and regional transformer models (mBERT,
XLM-RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTaV3, BanglaBERT, and IndicBERT) on masked
language modeling (MLM) tasks. Our experiments show that fine-tuned
multilingual models outperform their pre-trained counterparts when adapted to
Bangla-transliterated Chakma, achieving up to 73.54% token accuracy and a
perplexity as low as 2.90. Our analysis further highlights the impact of data
quality on model performance and shows the limitations of OCR pipelines for
morphologically rich Indic scripts. Our research demonstrates that
Bangla-transliterated Chakma can be very effective for transfer learning for
Chakma language, and we release our manually validated monolingual dataset to
encourage further research on multilingual language modeling for low-resource
languages.

### [125] [Large Language Models Do NOT Really Know What They Don't Know](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09033)
*Chi Seng Cheang,Hou Pong Chan,Wenxuan Zhang,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在处理事实性查询时无法可靠地区分真实与虚构的内容，只展示了知识召回的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs内部计算是否能够可靠地区分事实性和虚构性输出的界限，尤其是当错误和准确预测由相同训练目标驱动时。

Method: 通过比较两种基于主体信息的幻觉，分析LLMs在内部如何处理事实性查询，观察隐藏状态几何形状的重叠和区别来得出结论。

Result: 当幻觉与主体知识相关联时，LLMs使用与正确响应相同的内部召回过程，隐藏状态几何形状重叠且无法区分。反之，与主体知识脱离的幻觉表现出可检测到的独特和聚类的表示。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理知识召回时并不真正区分真实与幻想的内容，只编码知识召回的模式，而非事实性本身，证明了模型并不能真正意识到自己不知道的东西。

Abstract: Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality
signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention
weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may "know what they don't
know". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or
spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective
that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal
computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs.
In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process
factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their
reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are
associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process
as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable
hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject
knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them
detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode
truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall,
demonstrating that "LLMs don't really know what they don't know".

Motivation: 现有多语言模型常通过翻译大量可用数据来解决低资源语言模型的问题，但这些翻译通常缺乏质量和文化细微差别，并且数据整理和训练成本高。本文旨在应对这些挑战。

Method: 训练了一个高质量、多语言合成数据集（乌尔都语指导），使用修改后的自我指导技术，结合独特的提示和任务种子值，创建了包括乌尔都语本地链式思考、双语翻译、文化相关性和伦理安全性的一致性的数据集。

Result: Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct在乌尔都语特定任务上的性能优于其他模型，并在训练预算低于100美元的情况下超越了一些领先的多语言模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过独特的自我指导技术，明显提高了低资源语言，尤其是乌尔都语的语言模型性能。结果表明，使用这种技术能够高效地开发与文化相符的高性能低资源语言模型。

Abstract: Developing a high-performing large language models (LLMs) for low-resource
languages such as Urdu, present several challenges. These challenges include
the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety
concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating
large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality
and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation
and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a
multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique
approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset
(Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using
unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool,
this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning,
bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This
technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct
model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon
the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading
multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct,
and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100. Our
results demonstrate that high-performance and low-resource language LLMs can be
developed efficiently and culturally aligned using our modified self-instruct
approach. All datasets, models, and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架ReFIne，提升推理模型的可解释性、忠实性和可靠性，实验结果显示显著提高。代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了使推理系统能够被广泛使用，必须具有可信性，包括三个特性：可解释性、忠实性和可靠性。因此提出ReFIne框架来提升这三个特性。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练框架ReFIne，该框架将监督微调与GRPO结合起来，以鼓励模型提高可解释性、增强忠实性和促进可靠性。

Result: 实验结果显示，ReFIne模型在不同规模（1.7B/4B/8B）的Qwen3模型上应用，并在不同难度的数学基准上进行评估，表现出显著的提升。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，ReFIne模型能够产生更清晰、更结构化的推理轨迹，提高可解释性（+44.0%），更忠实地揭示其决策过程（忠实性+18.8%），并提供信息丰富的置信度估计（可靠性+42.4%）。这些发现突出了一个被忽视的重要方向：推理模型不仅应针对准确性进行优化，还应在更广泛的可信度维度上进行优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely
prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects
critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be
trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness,
and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve
interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level
planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by
explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with
consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing
self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the
final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales
(1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty.
Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and
better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully
expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer
informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight
an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not
only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness. Our code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索使用CLM进行语义框架诱导，克服MLM的局限，并在资源匮乏的语言中提高性能。

Method: 提出FrameEOL，一种基于CLM的提示方法，用于获得情景的框架嵌入。利用ICL和DML来获得更适合框架诱导的嵌入，然后进行聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明，在英语和日语FrameNet数据集上该方法优于现有的框架诱导方法。尤其在日语上，CLM方法通过少量ICL示例取得与MLM方法相当的效果。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于CLM的新方法，并在实验中证明了其优越性，尤其是在资源匮乏的日语中，仅使用少量ICL例子便取得了与MLM方法相当的效果。

Abstract: Semantic frame induction is the task of clustering frame-evoking words
according to the semantic frames they evoke. In recent years, leveraging
embeddings of frame-evoking words that are obtained using masked language
models (MLMs) such as BERT has led to high-performance semantic frame
induction. Although causal language models (CLMs) such as the GPT and Llama
series succeed in a wide range of language comprehension tasks and can engage
in dialogue as if they understood frames, they have not yet been applied to
semantic frame induction. We propose a new method for semantic frame induction
based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for
obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing
the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we
leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame
induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings.
Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate
that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In
particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based
method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the
MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.

Motivation: LLMs难以处理快速变化的信息和特定领域查询，RAG通过结合检索技术，帮助LLMs获取最新和相关的知识来解决这一问题。

Method: 结合LLMs与外部检索机制实现RAG，以提高LLMs应对快速变化的信息和特定领域查询的能力。

Result: RAG能够有效提升某些LLMs难以处理的应用场景的表现。

Conclusion: RAG对LLMs的支持效果已经减弱,但仍有潜力在某些应用中提升LLMs的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a wide range of applications
through their powerful capabilities in language understanding and generation.
However, as LLMs are trained on static corpora, they face difficulties in
addressing rapidly evolving information or domain-specific queries.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) was developed to overcome this limitation
by integrating LLMs with external retrieval mechanisms, allowing them to access
up-to-date and contextually relevant knowledge. However, as LLMs themselves
continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of
traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we
present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching
objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG,
highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness. Finally, we
showcase applications where LLMs alone perform inadequately, but where RAG,
when combined with LLMs, can substantially enhance their effectiveness. We hope
this work will encourage researchers to reconsider the role of RAG and inspire
the development of next-generation RAG systems.

Result: 情感语言模型在宜人性和神经质方面更好地符合说话者的大五人格特质。TAU增强数据的质量对模型性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 经过TAU增强的数据训练的情感语言模型比直接使用原始对话数据训练的模型更能准确模拟说话者的个性特征，尤其是在大五人格特质中的宜人性和神经质方面。

Abstract: This study proposes augmenting dialog data with think-aloud utterances (TAUs)
for modeling individual personalities in text chat by LLM. TAU is a
verbalization of a speaker's thought before articulating the utterance. We
expect "persona LLMs" trained with TAU-augmented data can mimic the speaker's
personality trait better. We tested whether the trained persona LLMs obtain the
human personality with respect to Big Five, a framework characterizing human
personality traits from five aspects. The results showed that LLMs trained with
TAU-augmented data more closely align to the speakers' Agreeableness and
Neuroticism of Big Five than those trained with original dialog data. We also
found that the quality of TAU-augmentation impacts persona LLM's performance.

Motivation: 由于文本去识别技术难以评估其隐匿个人信息能力，本文通过开发更强大的重新识别技术，以挑战去识别系统，从而更好地测量该技术的有效性。

Method: 本文提出两种策略以增强重新识别攻击的效果：首先，调整重新识别PII时的顺序并聚合多种排序的预测结果；其次，使用推理模型以提高重新识别的表现，特别是在拥有广泛背景知识的情况下。

Result: 研究表明，针对去识别技术的重新识别攻击中，调整信息重新识别的顺序和使用推理模型可以显著提高重新识别的效果。

Conclusion: 本文探讨了通过重新识别技术评估去识别方法的稳健性。研究表明，采用多重排序预测和推理模型可以大幅提升重新识别攻击的效果，从而提高对去识别技术的评价能力。

Abstract: Text de-identification techniques are often used to mask personally
identifiable information (PII) from documents. Their ability to conceal the
identity of the individuals mentioned in a text is, however, hard to measure.
Recent work has shown how the robustness of de-identification methods could be
assessed by attempting the reverse process of _re-identification_, based on an
automated adversary using its background knowledge to uncover the PIIs that
have been masked. This paper presents two complementary strategies to build
stronger re-identification attacks. We first show that (1) the _order_ in which
the PII spans are re-identified matters, and that aggregating predictions
across multiple orderings leads to improved results. We also find that (2)
reasoning models can boost the re-identification performance, especially when
the adversary is assumed to have access to extensive background knowledge.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新颖的增强翻译的方法，通过选择性应用层级微调来提高翻译能力的同时保持推理能力。

Abstract: General Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning, but those enhanced
for translation struggle with reasoning tasks. To address this, we propose a
novel translationenhanced recipe that begins with instruct models and applies
layer-selective tuning only on parallel data. Following this pipeline, we
introduce the Qwen3-XPlus models, which demonstrate significant improvements in
translation performance across both high- and lowresource languages, achieving
15+ spBLEU and 40+ xComet in low-resource languages, like Swahili.
Interestingly, training only with small parallel datasets, Qwen3-XPlus achieves
an average improvement of 1+ points on 7 multilingual tasks while maintaining
proficiency comparable to the Qwen3 instruct model in 15 popular reasoning
datasets. This work offers a promising approach to multilingual enhancement,
significantly reducing complexity and enhancing accessibility for a wider range
of languages. The code and model are publicly available.

Conclusion: DICE最显著的成就是在提高LLM输出的格式准确率和内容正确性方面，分别提升了35.4%和29.4%，并在相关任务中取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as
strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning
over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised
datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and
limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight
framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs
through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first
prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs
to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications.
This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while
ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first
constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and
subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating
structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate
that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM
outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance over other competitive baselines.

*Tao Feng,Lizhen Qu,Niket Tandon,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRIS 框架通过统计算法和LLM方法的结合，实现了无需预先数据集的实时因果关系发现与扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计算法在因果发现中面临昂贵的数据收集、冗余计算和不切实际的假设等问题，而基于LLM的方法虽能识别常见因果关系，但难以发现新的关系。因此，提出IRIS框架以解决这些限制。

Method: IRIS使用初始变量自动收集相关文件，提取变量，并结合统计算法和LLM方法的混合因果发现方法来发现已知和新的因果关系，同时提出和整合缺失变量以扩展因果关系图。

Result: 在没有现有数据集的情况下，IRIS 系统可以仅从初始变量进行实时因果发现，识别已知和新的因果关系并扩展因果图。

Conclusion: IRIS 系统提供了一种新的实时因果发现框架，通过混合使用统计算法和LLM方法解决了传统因果发现方法的不足，如数据收集昂贵、已知关系的多余计算和不切实际的假设。

Abstract: Causal discovery is fundamental to scientific research, yet traditional
statistical algorithms face significant challenges, including expensive data
collection, redundant computation for known relations, and unrealistic
assumptions. While recent LLM-based methods excel at identifying commonly known
causal relations, they fail to uncover novel relations. We introduce IRIS
(Iterative Retrieval and Integrated System for Real-Time Causal Discovery), a
novel framework that addresses these limitations. Starting with a set of
initial variables, IRIS automatically collects relevant documents, extracts
variables, and uncovers causal relations. Our hybrid causal discovery method
combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and
novel causal relations. In addition to causal discovery on initial variables,
the missing variable proposal component of IRIS identifies and incorporates
missing variables to expand the causal graphs. Our approach enables real-time
causal discovery from only a set of initial variables without requiring
pre-existing datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补自然语言处理(NLP)技术在危机情境警告消息生成中的应用不足，通过生成相应的警告信息来帮助处于危机中的平民。

Method: 创建了CrisiText数据集，包含13类危机情境中的40多万条警告消息，并进行了一系列实验，包括有监督微调、偏好对齐、零样本以及小样本方法。

Result: 实验比较了不同NLG方法在警告消息生成中的效果，并评估了自动后编辑的有效性，展示了此类技术在应对分布外情境中的潜力。

Conclusion: CrisiText有效地扩展了应对危机情境的自然语言生成(NLG)技术，通过实验展示了一系列NLG方法在警告消息生成中的应用效果。

Abstract: Effectively identifying threats and mitigating their potential damage during
crisis situations, such as natural disasters or violent attacks, is paramount
for safeguarding endangered individuals. To tackle these challenges, AI has
been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP
techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The
significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG
architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present
CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages
across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than
400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at
assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we
started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related
to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The
generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology
and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied
by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG
approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing
supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and
few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic
post-editor.

TL;DR: 研究引入自我批判法来检测LLM的RL后训练阶段数据污染，并通过RL-MIA基准测试验证其有效性，实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RL后训练阶段对LLM推理能力的提升，其污染检测方法的缺失成为关键的漏洞，因此需要开发专门的方法进行检测。

Method: 提出了一种名为自我批判的方法，通过探测模型的内在策略崩溃来检测数据污染，并引入RL-MIA基准测试来模拟污染场景。

Result: 实验结果表明，自我批判法显著优于基线方法，在多个模型和污染任务中的AUC提升达30%。与现有方法相比，自我批判使得RL阶段的污染检测成为可能。

Conclusion: 自我批判作为一种方法，可以有效地检测RL后训练阶段的数据污染，其在多个模型和污染任务上表现出色，比基线方法的AUC提升了30%。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant threat to the reliable evaluation of
Large Language Models (LLMs). This issue arises when benchmark samples may
inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported
performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training
and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the
increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As
RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of
specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a
critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study
of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique.
Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output
entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse
modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the
model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy
reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark
constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive
experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods
across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of
up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase
contamination, our method makes detection possible.

TL;DR: 引入CFVBench以改善多模态检索生成任务的格式和模态覆盖，为提高模型细粒度理解能力提出了AVR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态检索增强生成技术存在模式覆盖和格式多样性不足的问题，尤其是在处理单一或有限模态任务及粗粒度场景理解方面。为了填补这些缺口，引入了CFVBench大规模基准以提高多模态信息的精细理解。

Method: 引入CFVBench基准，包含599个视频和5360个开放式问题，并评估了7种检索方法和14种MLLM。同时提出了自适应视觉优化(AVR)框架，通过增加帧采样密度和选择性调用外部工具来提高细粒度多模态理解能力。

Result: 实验结果表明AVR方法能够显著增强多模态理解，提升所有评估的多模态大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: CFVBench为多模态大语言模型提供了一个多样和精细的评测基准，AVR框架成功改善了模型细粒度多模态细节获取能力，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to generate responses with external multimodal
evidence, and numerous video-based MRAG benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate model capabilities across retrieval and generation stages. However,
existing benchmarks remain limited in modality coverage and format diversity,
often focusing on single- or limited-modality tasks, or coarse-grained scene
understanding. To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale,
manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos,
yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and
domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials,
requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while
maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we
systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing
a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture
transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we
propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that
adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external
tools when necessary. Experiments show that AVR consistently enhances
fine-grained multimodal comprehension and improves performance across all
evaluated MLLMs

TL;DR: 提出了DyReMe动态基准测试，以更真实地评估医学诊断中的大型语言模型，发现其与实际临床实践存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学诊断领域，现有的大型语言模型评估方法主要依赖于静态基准测试，而这些测试基于公共医学考试项目存在夸大模型性能的问题，并忽视了教科书病例与现实世界中模糊多变的情况的差异。

Method: 提出了一种名为DyReMe的动态基准测试方法，它生成类似于咨询的案例，引入诊断中的干扰项，如鉴别诊断和常见误诊因素，并改变表达风格以模拟多样化的真实查询习惯。在评估模型时，除了准确性，DyReMe还从真实性、帮助程度和一致性三个临床相关维度进行评估。

Result: 通过实验表明，这种动态方法能够提供更具挑战性和现实性的评估，揭示出最先进的大型语言模型与真实临床实践之间的显著不一致性。

Conclusion: 需要一个更符合可信医学诊断需求的评估框架。

Abstract: Medical diagnostics is a high-stakes and complex domain that is critical to
patient care. However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are
fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely
on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to
overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases
and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward
dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are
limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address
these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that
better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions,
DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such
as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies
expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy,
DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions:
veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this
dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing
significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and
real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation
frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.

TL;DR: CLARity是一种成本效益高的RL框架，设计用于提高推理质量和准确性。它通过一致性奖励机制和动态数据策略在资源有限情况下有效地增强推理一致性。实验和人类评估显示其显著提升模型连贯性与专业性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺的领域训练专家大型语言模型（LLM）具有挑战性，通常依赖于选择题（MCQ）。然而，基于选择题的标准结果导向型强化学习（RL）是有风险的，因为尽管它可能提高准确性，但常常会降低推理质量，例如逻辑一致性。因此，本文旨在解决此问题。

Method: 本文提出了CLARity，这是一种成本效益高的强化学习框架。它结合了一种一致性感知的奖励机制以及一个两阶段的细化-监控训练管道，以增强推理一致性，并利用动态数据重组策略更好地开发有限数据。

Result: 实验表明，CLARity相比基线模型将响应一致性提高了16.5％，准确性提高了7.5％。人类评估进一步证实了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体提升。

Conclusion: CLARity提供了一种通用化的解决方案，使得较小的模型能够通过推理一致性有效指导专家模型。在实验中，CLARity将响应一致性提高了16.5％，准确性提高了7.5％，并且人类评估进一步确认了在连贯性和专业性方面的整体改进。

Abstract: Training expert LLMs in domains with scarce data is difficult, often relying
on multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, standard outcome-based
reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we
observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency.
Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward
Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose
CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using
only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware
reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to
enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to
better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves
response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human
evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and
professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables
smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的句子嵌入方法存在局限性，仅为每个句子分配一个向量，导致无法捕捉句子中的隐性语义。

Method: 提出一种新的句子嵌入方法DualCSE，它为每个句子赋予两个嵌入：一个表示显性语义，另一个表示隐性语义。这些嵌入共存于共享空间中。

Result: 实验结果表明，DualCSE能够有效地编码显性和隐性语义，并提升下游任务的表现。

Conclusion: DualCSE能够有效地编码显性和隐性语义，并提升下游任务的表现。

Abstract: Sentence embedding methods have made remarkable progress, yet they still
struggle to capture the implicit semantics within sentences. This can be
attributed to the inherent limitations of conventional sentence embedding
methods that assign only a single vector per sentence. To overcome this
limitation, we propose DualCSE, a sentence embedding method that assigns two
embeddings to each sentence: one representing the explicit semantics and the
other representing the implicit semantics. These embeddings coexist in the
shared space, enabling the selection of the desired semantics for specific
purposes such as information retrieval and text classification. Experimental
results demonstrate that DualCSE can effectively encode both explicit and
implicit meanings and improve the performance of the downstream task.

Motivation: Large Language Models在预训练过程中评估不稳定性影响了学习动态的真实观察。

Result: 实验表明MaP显著平滑性能曲线，减少运行间方差，确保更一致的模型排名。

Conclusion: MaP为观察LLM训练动态提供了更可靠和真实的视角，奠定LLM研究的实证基础。

Abstract: Reliable evaluation is fundamental to the progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet the evaluation process during pre-training is plagued by
significant instability that obscures true learning dynamics. In this work, we
systematically diagnose this instability, attributing it to two distinct
sources: \textit{Parameter Instability} from training stochasticity and
\textit{Evaluation Instability} from noisy measurement protocols. To counteract
both sources of noise, we introduce \textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that
synergistically integrates checkpoint \underline{M}erging \underline{a}nd the
\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by
averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance
statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP
yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance,
and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more
reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a
crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.

Method: 本文构建了一个包含超过11万个案例的中文法院观点生成数据集CCVG，并使用此数据集训练新设计的大型语言模型ShiZhi。

Result: 针对法院观点生成，ShiZhi达到了58.5 BLEU-1的评分，对于指控预测则达到了86.1%的准确率和92.5%的宏观F1。

Conclusion: ShiZhi展示了即使是小型的语言模型在经过高质量领域数据训练后，也能够生成合理且法律上连贯的法院观点。

Abstract: Criminal Court View Generation (CVG) is a fundamental task in legal

Based on this dataset, ShiZhi achieving 58.5 BLEU-1 on court view generation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的缓存淘汰策略忽视了dLLMs的特性，导致性能不佳，MaskKV的动机在于解决这一问题。

Method: MaskKV通过掩码查询引导的评分机制识别并清除不重要的提示词，并采用自适应的缓存预算策略优化资源分配。

Result: 在长文本任务上，MaskKV大幅减少了KV缓存需求，同时保留了高性能，并实现了显著的加速效果。

Conclusion: MaskKV为dLLMs提供了一种训练自由的缓存淘汰框架，通过掩码引导的评分机制和自适应缓存预算策略解决了现有缓存机制在内存开销上的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to
dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at
the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the
cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory
footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under
resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for
ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to
unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a
training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the
effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a
mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to
identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive
cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in
intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On
LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of
tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up
to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length. The code is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的CoT验证方法提供的关于计算失败原因的洞察有限，因此我们需要一种新方法来更好地理解推理失败的原因。

Method: 我们引入了一种白盒方法：基于电路的推理验证(CRV)。我们假设正确的CoT步骤的归因图作为模型潜在推理电路的执行轨迹，与错误步骤的轨迹相比具有独特的结构指纹。训练一个基于这些图的结构特征的分类器来检测推理错误。

Result: 我们展示了错误的结构特征具有很高的预测性，验证了直接通过计算图验证推理的可行性。我们发现这些特征具有高度的领域特异性，揭示不同推理任务中的失败表现为不同的计算模式。我们提供证据表明这些特征不仅仅是相关性的；通过我们的分析，我们成功地纠正模型错误的推理。

Conclusion: 我们的研究表明，通过审视模型的计算过程，我们可以从简单的错误检测转向对大语言模型推理的更深入、因果的理解。

Abstract: Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning
correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer
limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method:
Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution
graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent
reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of
incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these
graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning
errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by
other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are
highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly
via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly
domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest
as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these
signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide
targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully
correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a
model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a
deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了应对低秩压缩导致的性能下降和解码性能问题，本文提出了一种优化的方法来提高在资源受限硬件上部署大型语言模型的效能。

Method: 本文提出了一种称为FLRC的微粒低秩压缩器，通过为每层高效地分配最佳秩，并结合渐进低秩解码以维持文本生成质量。

Result: FLRC在各种基准测试中取得了显著的成绩，证明其在提高LLM推理性能方面的优越性。

Conclusion: FLRC比现有的低秩压缩方法在各种基准测试中表现优秀，尤其在文本摘要任务中ROUGE-L提高了17%。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance,
their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained
hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational
demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads
to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly
during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank
Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for
each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text
generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on
summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods,
establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.

TL;DR: LLP是一个基于LLM的框架，成功提高了二手产品定价的准确性和采用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 消费者对消费者平台上的个人卖家在为二手产品设定价格时面临显著挑战，且现有的静态回归模型难以捕捉市场变化。因此，提出一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的生成框架来解决这些问题。

Method: LLP框架首先检索类似产品，然后利用大型语言模型（LLM）理解自由文本中的关键定价信息，生成准确的价格建议。接着，通过双向推理构建的数据集，应用两阶段优化：监督微调（SFT）和组相对策略优化（GRPO），强化LLM对检索到的产品的领域推理。此外，LLP使用基于置信度的过滤机制来拒绝不可靠的价格建议。

Result: 在中国最大的二手电商平台闲鱼上部署LLP，并显著超过之前的定价方法。在相同的30%产品覆盖率下，将静态采用率（SAR）从40%提升至72%，并在90%召回率下保持强劲的47%SAR。

Conclusion: LLP提升了二手商品定价的准确性，显著超过现有方法，并在不同类别中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Unlike Business-to-Consumer e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon),
inexperienced individual sellers on Consumer-to-Consumer platforms (e.g., eBay)
often face significant challenges in setting prices for their second-hand
products efficiently. Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for
automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static
regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail
to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over
time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we
introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product
pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic
market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key
pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions.
To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a
two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative
policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning.
Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject
unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP
substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen
categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\footnote\{Xianyu is
China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\}, significantly outperforming
the previous pricing method. Under the same 30\% product coverage, it raises
the static adoption rate (SAR) from 40\% to 72\%, and maintains a strong SAR of
47\% even at 90\% recall.

TL;DR: 引入ReTraceQA基准测试以过程级别评估小型语言模型在常识推理中的有效性，结果显示SLMs性能可能被过高估计，使用大型语言模型进行推理评估时，性能下降显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的评估实践几乎完全依赖于最终答案的准确性，忽略了推理过程的有效性，这可能导致对小型语言模型能力的高估。

Method: 引入了一种名为 ReTraceQA 的新基准测试，进行过程级别的评估，以揭示小型语言模型在常识推理中的推理过程有效性。

Result: 通过专家标注的数据集揭示了，在许多情况下，小型语言模型能够提供正确的最终答案，但推理过程存在问题。在使用强大的大型语言模型进行推理感知评估时，所有模型和数据集上的SLM表现显著下降，分数减少最多可达25%。

Conclusion: 尽管小型语言模型（SLMs）在常识推理基准测试中表现出良好的性能，但目前的评估方法几乎完全依赖于最终答案的准确性，忽略了通向这些答案的推理过程的有效性。本文通过 ReTraceQA 引入一种新的基准测试，对常识推理任务进行过程级别的评估，揭示了许多情况下 SLMs 能够提供正确的最终答案，但推理过程存在缺陷。而评估指标仅专注于比较最终答案与标准答案使得 SLMs 的能力被高估。使用强大的大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自动判断者进行基于推理的评估而非仅答案评估时，SLM性能在所有模型和数据集上的分数下降显著，减少了最多25%。

Abstract: While Small Language Models (SLMs) have demonstrated promising performance on
an increasingly wide array of commonsense reasoning benchmarks, current
evaluation practices rely almost exclusively on the accuracy of their final
answers, neglecting the validity of the reasoning processes that lead to those
answers. To address this issue, we introduce ReTraceQA, a novel benchmark that
introduces process-level evaluation for commonsense reasoning tasks. Our
expert-annotated dataset reveals that in a substantial portion of instances
(14-24%), SLMs provide correct final answers despite flawed reasoning
processes, suggesting that the capabilities of SLMs are often overestimated by
evaluation metrics that focus only on comparing the final answer with the
ground truth. Indeed, we show that when employing strong Large Language Models
(LLMs) as automated judges for reasoning-aware evaluation rather than
answer-only metrics, SLM performance drops significantly across all models and
datasets, with scores decreasing by up to 25%.

TL;DR: 本文提出ThinkLogit方法，通过解码时利用logit算术引导非推理模型进行长链推理，无需额外训练。进一步的ThinkLogit-DPO通过偏好优化提升性能，实验显示该方法显著提高了准确率，并可适用于不同模型家族的引导和目标模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 首先考察大规模推理模型是否能够不经过训练而表现出长链推理行为。为此，提出了ThinkLogit以探索不经过训练即可实现长推理的可能性，并通过引入优化策略进一步增强性能。

Method: 本文提出了ThinkLogit方法，该方法在解码时利用logit算术，通过一个大规模的非推理模型进行长链推理，并利用一个较小的推理模型作为引导。为了提高性能，进一步提出了ThinkLogit-DPO，通过训练引导模型以优化正确/错误推理对的偏好，从目标和引导模型中采样进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，使用Qwen2.5-32B作为目标模型并由小21倍的R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B指导的ThinkLogit和ThinkLogit-DPO在五个推理基准上的平均准确率分别提高了24.5%和29.1%。此外，发现ThinkLogit对于来自不同模型家族的引导和目标模型仍然有效，并且可以直接插入改进过的小模型中的训练，以实现大模型的长推理。

Conclusion: 研究表明，虽然大规模推理模型表现出了长链式推理能力，但通常需要额外的训练。本文通过提出在解码时采用ThinkLogit方法，通过logit算术来调节目标非推理模型以进行长推理，并使用一个小得多的推理模型作为引导，证明了不经过任何训练就能引发这种行为的可能性。进一步，提出了ThinkLogit-DPO，通过对正误推理对的偏好优化来提升表现。这种方法实现了显著的准确率提升，并且对来自不同模型家族的引导和目标模型来说仍然有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models exhibit long chain-of-thought reasoning with
strategies such as backtracking and self-correction, though recent studies
suggest that these abilities typically require additional training. We first
investigate whether such behaviors can be elicited without any training. To
this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logit
arithmetic to tune a target large non-reasoning model for long reasoning using
a substantially smaller reasoning model as the guider. We then show that we can
further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference
optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the
target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments
demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement
in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning
benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x
smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider
and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to
post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised
distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield
stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in
large-scale models without costly post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过NL2GenSym框架结合LLM与SOAR生成符号规则，并在WJP数据集验证其高效性，取得了优于基线方法的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOAR架构虽然致力于发展类人智能体，但其实际应用因繁琐的手动规则编码而受阻。LLM的出现带来了高效规则生成的潜力，但缺乏实验验证。因此提出了结合LLM与SOAR的框架以弥补这一差距。

Method: 文章提出了一个名为NL2GenSym的框架，包含一个执行基础的生成者-评论者机制。生成者使用检索增强生成获取自我发展的领域知识库来从自然语言提出规则，并即时在SOAR环境中执行验证其正确性。评论者基于执行反馈驱动规则的迭代改进。

Result: 在WJP数据集上的实验表明该框架具有86%以上的成功率，生成了新的启发式规则，显著减少了决策周期，使得小参数模型优于大模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了NL2GenSym框架，该框架成功整合LLM与SOAR，通过自然语言自动生成符号规则，并在特定的WJP数据集上验证其有效性。

Abstract: SOAR, a classic symbol-based cognitive architecture, has been fostering the
development of general, human-like intelligent agents. Nevertheless, its
practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging
Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules
generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research
predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental
validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \textit{N}atural \textit{L}anguage
to \textit{Gen}erative \textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework
that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic
rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel
Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided
by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge
base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are
immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their
correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based
Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our
specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen
series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success
rate over 86\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the
framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision
cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of
baseline methods. Additionally, our initial experiments show that NL2GenSym
enables smaller-parameter models to achieve better performance than larger
counterparts.

Motivation: 领域专用的大型语言模型的微调机制尚不清楚，现有研究主要集中在自回归或通用指令模型上，对于领域专用模型的探索较少。

Method: 提出了一种新的调优向量框架，用于显式捕获微调引起的参数方向变化。

Result: 组合来自不同领域的调优向量可以提高模型的广义性。调优向量主要修改了模型MLP层中的方向性信息，同时增强了注意力头中的现有方向。

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统性地研究了大型医学语言模型的领域特定微调，发现微调仅改变了模型表示子空间的一小部分，基本保留了预训练模型的表示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned for specific domains exhibit strong
performance; however, the underlying mechanisms by which this fine-tuning
reshapes their parametric space are not well understood. Prior works primarily
focus on auto-regressive or general-purpose instruct models, leaving
domain-specialised LLMs under-explored. We present the first systematic study
of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis
reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational
subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To
interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel
framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional
parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are
critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality.
Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved
generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these
vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the
model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads. Our findings
offer new insights into LLM adaptation and provide a general, interpretable
framework for analysing specialisation in large language models.

TL;DR: TEPO improves mathematical reasoning in LLMs by addressing issues in GRPO through a novel token-level method, showing significant performance and stability enhancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO and related methods face challenges with sparse token rewards and the tendency for entropy collapse. TEPO aims to address these challenges.

Method: TEPO incorporates Markov Likelihood and token-level aggregation to link group-level rewards with tokens.

Result: TEPO outperforms existing baselines across metrics like @k and accuracy, demonstrating improved mathematical reasoning and training stability.

Conclusion: TEPO sets a new state of the art in mathematical reasoning tasks and enhances training stability, overcoming the issues faced by GRPO and similar methods.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the
reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs), particularly by boosting
their mathematical performance. However, GRPO and related
entropy-regularization methods still face challenges rooted in the sparse token
rewards inherent to chain-of-thought (CoT). Current approaches often rely on
undifferentiated token-level entropy adjustments, which frequently lead to
entropy collapse or model collapse. In this work, we propose TEPO, a novel
token-level framework that incorporates Markov Likelihood (sequence likelihood)
links group-level rewards with tokens via token-level aggregation. Experiments
show that TEPO consistently outperforms existing baselines across key metrics
(including @k and accuracy). It not only sets a new state of the art on
mathematical reasoning tasks but also significantly enhances training
stability.

*Ziyu Zheng,Yaming Yang,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao,Xinyan Huang,Weigang Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents MSGCOT, an advanced graph prompt-tuning method incorporating multi-scale information, outperforming existing techniques especially in few-shot cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph prompt-tuning methods are limited by single-granularity prompt generation, which overlooks multi-scale structural information inherent in graph data. This limitation affects the diversity and effectiveness of prompt semantics.

Method: The paper introduces a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework that uses a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to capture multi-scale structural features efficiently. It integrates these features dynamically at each reasoning step to form a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.

Result: MSGCOT framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning methods on eight benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: MSGCOT outperforms existing single-granularity graph prompt-tuning methods, showcasing superior performance, especially in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: The "pre-train, prompt'' paradigm, designed to bridge the gap between
pre-training tasks and downstream objectives, has been extended from the NLP
domain to the graph domain and has achieved remarkable progress. Current
mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using
learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to
single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt
generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in
graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this
issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt
and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework.
Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to
efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis
vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from
coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at
each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain.
Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT
outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method,
particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a cost-effective method for selecting the best Large Language Model without the need for fully annotated datasets.

Method: Adaptive selection of a small set of queries for annotation, coupled with a judge-based oracle annotation model.

Result: The framework reduced annotation costs by up to 59.62% across experiments with 151 LLMs on 6 benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLM SELECTOR is effective in reducing annotation costs while selecting the best LLM for a given task.

Abstract: We introduce LLM SELECTOR, the first framework for active model selection of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike prior evaluation and benchmarking
approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets, LLM SELECTOR efficiently
identifies the best LLM with limited annotations. In particular, for any given
task, LLM SELECTOR adaptively selects a small set of queries to annotate that
are most informative about the best model for the task. To further reduce
annotation cost, we leverage a judge-based oracle annotation model. Through
extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks with 151 LLMs, we show that LLM SELECTOR
reduces annotation costs by up to 59.62% when selecting the best and near-best
LLM for the task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管命名实体在文本中是知识的重要组成部分，但目前尚不清楚大型语言模型如何内部表示这些实体。本文旨在研究这方面的问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为实体提及重构的新框架，以研究LLMs如何编码和操控实体，提出了任务向量的方法，能够从多种实体表示中一致生成多词提及。

Result: 实验显示，LLMs不仅能够重构实体提及，还能超越最后一词嵌入来编码多词实体提及，并且这些表示能够捕获关系性知识。

Conclusion: 研究表明，大型语言模型中存在专门用于处理和表示实体的机制，包括那些在训练期间未见过的多词实体。

Abstract: Named entities are fundamental building blocks of knowledge in text,
grounding factual information and structuring relationships within language.
Despite their importance, it remains unclear how Large Language Models (LLMs)
internally represent entities. Prior research has primarily examined explicit
relationships, but little is known about entity representations themselves. We
introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how
LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can
be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are
encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture
relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to
consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations
derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_,
extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring
new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and
manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of context management strategies for

evaluate traditional multimodal context (combining text history and spoken
current turn), full spoken history, and compressed spoken history approaches.
Our experiments on the SpokenWOZ corpus demonstrate that providing the full

similar size, significantly surpassing prior methods. Furthermore, we show that
attention-pooling-based compression of the spoken history offers a strong
trade-off, maintaining competitive accuracy with reduced context size. Detailed

Abstract: This work presents the first large-scale investigation into constructing a
fully open bilingual large language model (LLM) for a non-English language,
specifically Korean, trained predominantly on synthetic data. We introduce
KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English
corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic
experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated
with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not
cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore,
the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight
multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and
instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1)
synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model
collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning
and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including
data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent
framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in

Abstract: Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been
shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However,
large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented
tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content
written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In
recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large
language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various
natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from
crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in,
for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100
categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises
privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools
often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these
challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support
reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging
objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash
Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash
narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject
task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT.
Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation
Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models
outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal
training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can
capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations
in the dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper addresses the limitation in accessibility to LLM training data by showcasing solutions for indexing large-scale datasets effectively, which is crucial for improving LLM performance and safety, while also taking steps towards environmentally-friendly computing.

Method: The researchers implemented a full-text indexing pipeline for LLM training data using Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, which comprises an advanced arm64 supercluster.

Result: The study successfully indexed 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train Apertus LLM, proving the feasibility of full-text indexing at this scale and demonstrating its practical utility for LLM safety and open web search efficiency.

Conclusion: This study provides viable solutions for large-scale data indexing using an arm64-based infrastructure, demonstrating its effectiveness, feasibility, and the associated benefits for LLM safety, which facilitates greener computing directions.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their
training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM
training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the
data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite
potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.
  In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM
training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps
infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster,
we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM
family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline,
curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation
arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at
the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible
and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure
previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.
  We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting
large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener
computation.

Result: 实验表明，虽然大型语言模型在递归性方面表现良好，但在组合性方面仍然存在困难；混合架构在保持高效率的同时加强了推理能力。

Conclusion: 融合符号推理与神经计算的混合架构能够加强通用化能力，提高推理效率。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to
generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a
critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability:
compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying
complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate
representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the
literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella
term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the
logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs)
using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning.
Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of
formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning
abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate
reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality.
To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we
propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural
computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient
inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning
ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved
even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed
methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of
hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural
reasoning systems.

scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates
large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring
academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to
both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of
reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models
such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\% on research-level problems, with
open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the
unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs.
We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究证明使用大语言模型可以在无标签的情况下更可靠地评估NLP模型在不同领域的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不使用标签的情况下估计模型性能是理解NLP模型泛化能力的一个重要目标。此前的研究提出了基于数据集相似性或预测正确性的度量方法，但在跨领域时，这些估算何时能产生可靠的性能排名尚不清楚。

Method: 该研究使用一个两步评估设置，结合四个基础分类器和几个大语言模型作为错误预测器进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，大语言模型为基础的错误预测器相比漂移或零样本基线产生了更强和更一致的排名相关性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在跨领域评估中，当各领域间的性能差异较大且错误模型的预测与基础模型的真实失败模式一致时，基于大语言模型的错误预测器更能产生更强和更一致的排名相关性。

Abstract: Estimating model performance without labels is an important goal for
understanding how NLP models generalize. While prior work has proposed measures
based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when
these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this
paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step
evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models
as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets,
spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors
produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than
drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings:
ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are
larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true
failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can
be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种新的口音不变ASR框架，有效地降低了英语和波斯语中因为口音而导致的识别错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练的基于transformer的ASR模型对口音和方言变化敏感的问题，尤其是在语言多样性强的语言（如英语和波斯语）中导致的高词错误率。

Method: 在识别流程中集成口音和方言分类，训练一个基于频谱图的分类器以捕获口音特定的线索，遮盖预测中最有影响的区域，并使用遮盖后的频谱图进行数据增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用Whisper模型的遮盖和增强策略在英语和波斯语环境中均大幅降低了WER。

Conclusion: 提出的口音不变的ASR框架显著降低了英语和波斯语中的词错误率（WER），增强了模型对口音变化的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic
speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal
variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically
diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we
propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect
classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a
spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the
regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms
for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against
accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian
speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple
regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent
variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech
research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource,
linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model
demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER
reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness
of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR
systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity. Code and dataset

TL;DR: GRSP balances efficiency and accuracy in LRMs, optimizing token use and enhancing RL training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address excessive reasoning in LRMs due to oversimplified token-level supervision, aiming for better efficiency and accuracy balance.

Method: Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method with length-aware weighting for reasoning segments.

Result: GRSP demonstrates better token efficiency and maintains accuracy, especially in complex problems, and improves RL training stability.

Conclusion: GRSP method provides a balance between efficiency and accuracy, stabilizing RL training and scaling well across model sizes.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) boosted by Reinforcement Learning from Verifier
Reward (RLVR) have shown great power in problem solving, yet they often cause
overthinking: excessive, meandering reasoning that inflates computational cost.
Prior designs of penalization in RLVR manage to reduce token consumption while
often harming model performance, which arises from the oversimplicity of
token-level supervision. In this paper, we argue that the granularity of
supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and
propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to
regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments
are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design
a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GRSP achieves superior token efficiency without
heavily compromising accuracy, especially the advantages with harder problems.
Moreover, GRSP stabilizes RL training and scales effectively across model
sizes.

TL;DR: 研究了多语言应用中LLMs对拼写错误输入的鲁棒性，提出了MulTypo算法生成拼写错误进行评估，结果显示拼写错误降低了性能，强调了噪声-aware训练的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在多语言应用中的普及，研究了其在存在拼写错误输入下的鲁棒性问题，旨在弥补当前基准测试假设输入无错误的不足。

Method: 提出了一种MulTypo算法，该算法基于语言键盘布局和输入行为模拟人类错误，并对18种开源LLMs进行了评估，涉及三个模型系列和五个下游任务。

Result: 拼写错误明显降低了生成任务和需要推理任务的性能，自然语言推理任务则较为鲁棒。说明了指令微调在干净输入时改善性能，但在噪声条件下可能增加脆弱性。同时观察到语言依赖的鲁棒性：高资源语言通常比低资源语言更鲁棒，从英语翻译普遍比翻译成英语更鲁棒。

Conclusion: MulTypo算法提供了一种生成多语言拼写错误的方法，有助于评估LLMs在处理真实世界应用中的拼写错误输入的能力，强调了在训练中考虑噪音和进行多语言鲁棒性评估的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual,
real-world applications with user inputs -- naturally introducing typographical
errors (typos). Yet most benchmarks assume clean input, leaving the robustness
of LLMs to typos across languages largely underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce MulTypo, a multilingual typo generation algorithm that simulates
human-like errors based on language-specific keyboard layouts and typing
behavior. We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five
downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering,
mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that
typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and
those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is
comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance
but may increase brittleness under noise. We also observe language-dependent
robustness: high-resource languages are generally more robust than low-resource
ones, and translation from English is more robust than translation into
English. Our findings underscore the need for noise-aware training and
multilingual robustness evaluation. We make our code and data publicly
available.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the limitations of Diffusion Large Language Models in complex tasks due to parallel-sequential contradictions and proposes practical solutions to enhance their effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation for this research is to address the limitations of current DLLMs in handling complex reasoning tasks due to parallel decoding conflicts and to propose solutions for improving their performance.

Method: The study uses behavioral analyses of DLLMs in various reasoning tasks to identify and characterize the Parallel-Sequential Contradiction. It introduces scaling dimensions and proposes practical mitigations to address these challenges.

Result: The research finds that while parallel scaling in DLLMs consistently improves performance, diffusion and sequential scaling are restricted by the Parallel-Sequential Contradiction. It suggests mitigations to alleviate these issues.

Conclusion: DLLMs show promise in high-throughput and effective sequential reasoning but face limitations due to the Parallel-Sequential Contradiction, which requires careful handling to optimize their performance in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have offered high
throughput and effective sequential reasoning, making them a competitive
alternative to autoregressive LLMs (ALLMs). However, parallel decoding, which
enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often
required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core
Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and
complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for
directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to
autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive
prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking
without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection,
reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we
introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and
sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements,
diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these
findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented
prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce
PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.

TL;DR: 通过一个整合多语言语义和高效长视频处理的多阶段框架实现了多语言视频检索的突破。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么将小时长的视频压缩成粗略的嵌入，要么在细粒度匹配上产生高昂的成本，因而需要一种新的方法来有效地从多语言医疗档案检索相关的教学视频，以回答跨语言界限的复杂多跳问题。

Method: 该方法采用一个多阶段框架，整合了多语言语义、领域术语以及高效的长视频处理。在查询时，使用语言无关的多语言编码器对输入问题进行编码，通过粗到细的树搜索剪除不相关的分支，最终对排名靠前的片段进行轻量的大语言模型（LLM）重新评分。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的方法在mVCR测试集上展现了最先进的性能，消融研究证实了知识图谱增强、分层索引和目标LLM重排名的互补贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法在特定的医疗视频集中的多语言检索中提供了一种准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieving relevant instructional videos from multilingual medical archives
is crucial for answering complex, multi-hop questions across language
boundaries. However, existing systems either compress hour-long videos into
coarse embeddings or incur prohibitive costs for fine-grained matching. We
tackle the Multilingual Video Corpus Retrieval (mVCR) task in the NLPCC-2025
M4IVQA challenge with a multi-stage framework that integrates multilingual
semantics, domain terminology, and efficient long-form processing. Video
subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise
knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node
embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query
time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search
prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a
lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive
cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on
the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation
studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical
indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking. The proposed method offers an accurate
and scalable solution for multilingual retrieval in specialized medical video
collections.

Motivation: 虽然多语言环境中的最终答案准确性已有探讨，但思维路径，即导向最终答案的中间步骤，尚未得到充分研究，故而进行该研究。

Method: 研究采用语言合规性、答案准确性和一致性评估语言偏好和表现差异；通过跨语言交换思维路径评估一致性；并适应扰动技术，如截断和错误注入，分析思维路径的忠实性。

Result: 研究结果表明，LRMs在目标语言中的思维路径存在强语言偏好，且其激励的思维路径对模型的依赖程度在不同语言中表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 该研究对多语言CoT推理进行了全面分析，发现不同语言下思维路径的质量和有效性显著不同，并且模型对思维路径的依赖程度各异。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) increasingly rely on step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve task performance, particularly in
high-resource languages such as English. While recent work has examined
final-answer accuracy in multilingual settings, the thinking traces themselves,
i.e., the intermediate steps that lead to the final answer, remain
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of
multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance,
consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance,
answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or
prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language
preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess
crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between
languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary
substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt
perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to
probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models
rely on traces to varying degrees. We release our code and data to support
future research.

Method: 提出WUGNECTIVES数据集，包含8880个用于评估语言模型在连接词将实体与特定属性联系起来的上下文中，对新颖实体推断的刺激。同时，调查了17种不同规模和训练方案的语言模型。

Result: 对大多数连接词进行微调语言模型后，取得了显著的改进。然而，各模型在不同连接词类型上的总体表现存在较大差异，尤其是在表示让步意义的连接词上存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究发现，微调语言模型以展示推理行为可以显著改善大多数连接词的表现。然而，不同连接词类型的总体表现差异较大，特别是在表示让步意义的连接词上，所有模型都表现出系统性困难。

Abstract: The role of world knowledge has been particularly crucial to predict the
discourse connective that marks the discourse relation between two arguments,
with language models (LMs) being generally successful at this task. We flip
this premise in our work, and instead study the inverse problem of
understanding whether discourse connectives can inform LMs about the world. To
this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates
LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the
entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various
scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning
behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time,
there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type,
with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a
concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations
into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release
WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel automated task, AutoPR, and its evaluation benchmark PRBench, showing that the multi-agent framework PRAgent significantly enhances the promotion of academic papers on social platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The surge in peer-reviewed research and the reliance on social platforms for discovery and promotion motivated the development of an automated solution to transform research papers into public content efficiently, reducing the human effort required.

Method: A multi-agent framework called PRAgent is proposed, consisting of three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation. The system's efficacy is evaluated using PRBench, a benchmark linking articles to promotional posts.

Result: PRAgent improves promotional effectiveness significantly, evidenced by a 604% increase in watch time, a 438% increase in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement compared to direct LLM pipelines.

Conclusion: AutoPR has been shown to significantly outperform direct LLM pipelines in promoting academic papers, with substantial improvements in engagement metrics as demonstrated by PRBench.

Abstract: As the volume of peer-reviewed research surges, scholars increasingly rely on
social platforms for discovery, while authors invest considerable effort in
promoting their work to ensure visibility and citations. To streamline this
process and reduce the reliance on human effort, we introduce Automatic
Promotion (AutoPR), a novel task that transforms research papers into accurate,
engaging, and timely public content. To enable rigorous evaluation, we release
PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to
high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity
(accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment
(timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent
framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with
multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and
platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum
reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates
substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438%
rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation
studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most
to these gains. Our results position AutoPR as a tractable, measurable research
problem and provide a roadmap for scalable, impactful automated scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS) enables real-time, high-fidelity reasoning in spoken language models using a dual-brain approach, significantly enhancing performance and reducing latency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high latency in real-time spoken language models for Chain-of-Thought reasoning and to emulate human-like simultaneous thinking and speaking.

Method: The paper introduces a dual-brain approach, involving a 'Formulation Brain' for reasoning and an 'Articulation Brain' for speech generation, which allows simultaneous thinking and speaking processes without mode-switching delays.

Result: The proposed MPS framework achieves high accuracy and performance in tasks like Spoken-MQA and URO-Bench, outperforming existing methods and achieving reasoning performance on par with pre-computation models, with reduced latency.

Conclusion: Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS) offers a substantial improvement in enabling spoken language models to perform real-time reasoning and speech generation efficiently, significantly reducing latency while maintaining reasoning quality.

Abstract: Real-time Spoken Language Models (SLMs) struggle to leverage Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning due to the prohibitive latency of generating the entire thought
process sequentially. Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans,
is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced
Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity,
real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for
thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a
"Formulation Brain" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate
"Articulation Brain" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor
eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process.
Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing
think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to
models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically
reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method
achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and
attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench. Our work
effectively bridges the gap between high-quality reasoning and real-time
interaction.

Motivation: 大语言模型在使用链式思维范例时表现出强大的推理能力，但收集推理数据集非常耗费资源，因此提出了一种低成本推理时间数据增强策略P-TTS。

Method: 引入了推理时间数据增强策略P-TTS，通过微调增强LLM的推理能力，采用方法是在有限的实例上进行系统的指令提示强度变化，以生成多样的推理轨迹上下文，然后在这些数据上微调不同大小的模型。

Result: P-TTS模型在数学推理数据集AIME2024 & 25、MATH500和GPQA-Diamond表现优于先前的基准，取得了显著的准确率提升，并且在零样本情况下对域外推理基准的通用性也有所增强。

Conclusion: P-TTS提供了一种实用且低成本的方法，可以在资源有限或快速发展领域中激发大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities when provided with chain-of-thought exemplars, but curating large
reasoning datasets remains laborious and resource-intensive. In this work, we
introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective
inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through
finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,
P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances
and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction
prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory
contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.
Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and
GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive
baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of
+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);
P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and
+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better
performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances
zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of
Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our
analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space
of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation
overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of
LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit
LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.

Motivation: 现有的VRP解决方案在处理不结构化地址、不完整地图和距离估算的计算限制时效果有限，提出一种新框架以改善此问题。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLM）对VRP生成的路径进行评估，并与政策标准进行比对。

Result: 开源LLM能够以79%的准确率识别人流问题，而专有推理模型达到了86%的准确率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于LLM的VRP路径评估是一种有效且可扩展的评估方法，超越了传统的距离和时间指标。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法采用模块化架构将导航规划与视觉世界模型分开，导致状态动作不对齐，并且在新颖或动态场景中适应性有限。

Method: 提出了一种统一的、带记忆增强的世界模型UniWM，将视觉预见和规划整合在单个多模态自回归讨论中。采用层次化记忆机制，结合短期感知线索和长期轨迹背景。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准上进行的广泛实验表明，UniWM在导航成功率上提高最多30%，明显减少了与强基线相比的轨迹误差，并在未见数据集上实现了零样本概括。

Conclusion: UniWM显著改善了导航成功率，减少了轨迹误差，并在未见数据集上实现了零样本概括。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

Motivation: 期望通过改进启发式设计方案，提升算法的健壮性和性能。

Method: 采用LLM生成启发式设计，并结合解释启发式表现不佳原因和如何改进的工具。

Result: 所生成的启发式算法在最差情况下的性能提升了约28倍，提高了平均性能，并保持了运行时间的稳定。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM与解释启发式表现不佳原因和改进建议的工具相结合，可以生成更强健和性能更优越的启发式算法。

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

### [175] [GTAlign: Game-Theoretic Alignment of LLM Assistants for Mutual Welfare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08872)
*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GTAlign的新框架，通过博弈论决策机制改善大语言模型的推理效率和答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型对齐方法假设最大化模型回报能同时最大化用户福祉，但实际上模型可能生成冗长或过度澄清的回答，因此需要一种既能惠及用户又能优化模型行为的决策机制。

Method: 引入博弈论决策机制，通过创建支付矩阵进行推理，并采用互惠奖励方法训练模型，以提高用户和模型的福祉。

Result: GTAlign通过将博弈论决策融入到推理和训练阶段，成功提升了模型在多个任务上的表现。

Conclusion: 实验表明，GTAlign在推理效率、答案质量和互惠方面相比基准模型有显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过实验，发现AI评估系统在艺术风格判断中不仅复制了人类的偏见，还进一步放大了这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格，因为这个领域缺乏客观标准，判断本质上是主观的。

Method: 进行了控制实验，比较人类和AI模型对文学段落的评价，使用了盲测、准确标记和虚假标记三种条件。

Result: 实验揭示了系统性的亲人类归因偏见。人类显示出+13.7个百分点的偏见，而AI模型显示出+34.3个百分点的偏见，影响更为显著。

Conclusion: AI评估系统在艺术风格判断中不仅复制了人类的偏见，还进一步放大了这种偏见。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前科学出版界的同行评审存在的不一致性、审稿人主观性和可扩展性挑战。

Method: 使用ReviewerToo框架进行系统实验，包括使用专业化的审稿人角色和结构化评价标准，并在现实会议工作流程中部分或完全集成。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的数据集上，gpt-oss-120b模型在将论文分类为接受/拒绝的任务中实现了81.8%的准确率，而平均人类审稿人的准确率为83.9%。此外，ReviewerToo生成的评审被LLM评判为质量高于人类平均水平，但仍落后于最强专家贡献。

Conclusion: 提出了一种称为ReviewerToo的模块化框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助的同行评审，以系统和一致的评估补充人类判断。实验结果表明，该系统在某些方面优于人类审稿，但在方法论创新和理论贡献的评估方面仍需人类专家的参与。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

Motivation: 现有的评估标准无法有效捕捉模型在实时和对抗环境中的表现，需要一种新的评估方式。

Method: 通过在经典格斗游戏《真人快打II》中对多个模型进行对战，测试它们在快速视觉理解和战术决策上的性能，每个模型操作同一个角色来确保公平性。

Result: 在一个控制下的锦标赛中对六个领先的开源和闭源模型进行了测试，并实现了完全自动化、可重复和客观的评估。

Conclusion: 一个新的评估框架LM Fight Arena被提出，用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）在动态环境中的策略推理能力，为AI评估与互动娱乐之间架起桥梁。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR 是一种新框架，通过机器机制解释法检测 LLM 的数据污染，表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染严重影响了可靠的 LLM 评估，可能使模型因记忆训练数据而获得高分，而未能表现出真正的推理能力。

Method: RADAR 提取了包括注意力专用化、电路动态和激活流模式在内的 37 个特征，并使用这些特征的分类器集成检测数据污染。

Result: RADAR 在多样化评估集上达到了 93%的准确率，对于明显样例实现了完美表现，对于具有挑战性的模糊样例实现了 76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: RADAR 通过深入的机器机制解释能力，有效区分模型的回忆和推理反应，推动了 LLM 评价标准的进步。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种新的基准，用于评估检索增强生成（RAG）管道的整体性能，发现闭源管道在多模态和跨文档信息问题上的表现优于开源管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有基准测试往往关注特定方面（如检索），而缺乏整体评估管道的能力，因此我们提出了一个新的基准来评估RAG管道整体，以提高大语言模型的事实准确性。

Method: 设计了一个基准来评估整个RAG管道，包括利用开源检索机制构建的两个管道和四个闭源基础模型的比较评估，并进行第三方的人类评估来验证我们的正确性和幻觉指标。

Result: 人类对我们的正确性和幻觉检测指标的评估显示，在1-5的Likert量表上平均达成了一致，其中正确性为4.62，幻觉检测为4.53。

Conclusion: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测指标上显著优于开源管道，特别是在需要多模态和跨文档信息的问题上表现出更大的性能差距。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG通过实体中心化的知识图谱RAG框架，在复杂问答中提高了检索效率和准确率，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆轨迹进行复杂多跳回忆的机制启发，研究者提出EcphoryRAG以提高复杂问题回答效率。

Method: EcphoryRAG引入了实体中心化的知识图谱框架，在索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及相关元数据，显著减少了token消耗。在检索阶段，该系统通过提取查询中的提示实体，实现了跨知识图谱的多跳关联检索，并动态推理实体之间的隐含关系，以丰富语境。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准上的广泛评估表明，EcphoryRAG创造了新的技术标准，将EM平均得分从0.392提高到0.474，验证了实体提示多跳检索范式在复杂问答中的有效性。

Conclusion: EcphoryRAG提出了一种实体中心化的知识图谱RAG框架，通过高效的多跳检索机制，实现了复杂问题的高效回答，提高了基于知识图谱的RAG方法的性能。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

TL;DR: DualResearch通过检索和融合两个互补语义图，解决了多工具科学推理中的稳定性和效果问题，提高了系统的答案重构能力，在基准测试上性能优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度研究框架中存在的上下文污染、证据支持弱和执行路径脆弱的问题，需要一个新的融合框架来提高系统的稳定性和效果。

Method: DualResearch采用检索和融合框架，协同建模两个互补图：编码稳定背景知识的广度语义图和捕获执行出处的深度因果图，通过每层路径证据转换为答案分布，并在对数空间通过使用全局校准的熵门控规则融合。

Result: DualResearch在科学推理基准测试HLE和GPQA上达到竞争性表现，使用InternAgent的日志文件，其准确性在HLE上提高了7.7%，在GPQA上提高了6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch有效地解决了深度研究框架中存在的上下文污染、证据支持弱和执行路径脆弱问题，通过创建两个互补的语义图，使系统能够稳定、高效地重构答案。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的知识注入方法SCT，显著提升知识图谱任务的性能，超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的前缀调优范式中，简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入串联，忽视了知识图谱中的丰富关系语义，并对大型语言模型施加了显著的隐性推理负担。

Method: 提出了一种新的知识注入范式——语义条件调优 (Semantic-condition Tuning, SCT)，包括两个关键模块：语义图模块和条件自适应融合模块。

Result: SCT在知识图谱基准测试中显著超越了前缀调优和其他强基线，通过预融合嵌入实现深度、特征层面和知识感知的交互。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理之前利用语义图上下文调节输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和强大的信号，能够实现更准确和稳健的知识推理，有效提升知识图谱任务的性能。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大规模的多模态语言模型在各类任务中展现出惊人的能力，但在推理效率上仍面临诸多挑战。因此，需要开发能够高效推理的轻量级多模态模型。

Method: 提出了两阶段优化方法，包括长度感知相对策略优化（LIPO）和自适应模型合并（AMM），用于训练和优化多模态轻量级推理模型。

Result: Tiny-R1V经过评估，在数学、结构化数据（图表、表格、文档）、OCR和一般能力等十个广泛使用的推理基准上表现出色，使得轻量级模型能够在多样化的多模态推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V作为一种轻量级模型，通过两阶段优化提升了推理速度和准确率，展现了其在多模态推理任务上的优越性能。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有基准在评估LLM规划能力方面存在不足，无法有效评估旅游计划的可行性、可靠性和吸引力。

Method: 使用了测试时计算、神经符号方法、监督微调以及基于GRPO的强化学习，进行广泛实验。

Result: 基准评估器与旅游专家标注达到了60.75%的中等一致性，并超越了多个LLM裁判基线。基于所发布的4,870个查询的大规模数据集进行的实验表明，RL能够提高行程的可行性并获得更高的总体奖励分数。

Conclusion: 提出了一种全面的旅游计划基准，以单一奖励衡量计划质量，并与强化学习无缝集成。基于该基准的实验表明，通过强化学习能够提高行程的可行性。

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合框架LRR，通过结合符号模块和LLM解决ReDoS问题，提升修复率15.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于正则表达式的普遍性导致系统容易受到正则表达式拒绝服务（ReDoS）攻击，亟需自动化修复方法。当前方法受到精确性与一般化能力之间的权衡限制，需要一种既能精确识别问题又能可靠修复复杂漏洞的方法。

Method: 研究采用了混合框架方法，首先通过确定性符号模块定位精确的漏洞子模式，然后调用大型语言模型（LLM）为该独立片段生成语义等效的修复。

Result: 该混合框架成功解决了规则修复难以处理的复杂案例，并避免了仅依赖LLM方法的语义错误，相对于最新技术，修复率提高了15.4%。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新的混合框架——局部正则表达式修复（LRR），结合了符号模块和大型语言模型，以解决正则表达式拒绝服务（ReDoS）漏洞的修复问题。通过将问题识别与修复过程分离，该体系结构成功解决了复杂修复案例，并提高了修复率。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Motivation: 现有的LLMs无法在所有复杂度类上都表现优异，需要一种能够根据性能分配模型并提供专门指令的系统。

Method: 提出MEC$^3$O多专家共识系统，将LLMs分配给特定复杂度类，并通过结构化辩论和加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 实验表明，在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC$^3$O取得至少10%的准确率和macro-F1分数提升，并在macro-F1分数方面超过GPT-4o-mini，同时与GPT-4o和GPT-o4-mini实现竞争性相当的表现。

Conclusion: MEC$^3$O系统通过进行多专家辩论和加权共识策略有效地提高了代码复杂度的预测准确性，超越了现有的开源基线和GPT-4o-mini。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

*Jingxuan Wu,Zhenglin Wan,Xingrui Yu,Yuzhe Yang,Bo An,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需重新训练的推理控制方法，通过保持生成流的正交扰动，提高图像多样性，同时保持质量和文本一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于流的文本到图像模型路径确定，用户需重复采样以发现多样模式，其过程昂贵且效率低下。

Method: 该方法通过特征空间目标引导生成路径的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。该扰动与生成流是正交的，这一几何约束使其能够在不降低图像细节或文本一致性的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续提升多样性指标（如Vendi Score和Brisque）并保持图像质量和一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种训练自由的推理控制机制，使模型本身具有多样性意识，在不需要重新训练或修改基采样器的情况下提高生成图像的多样性，同时保持图像质量和文本对齐。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出PAC推理方法，通过动态切换模式实现高效推理，保证性能损失的可控性。实验显示其可节约计算资源并控制性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模推理模型在解决复杂问题上表现出色，但其部署时的高计算成本亟需更高效的推理方法。现行的动态模式切换方法虽然提高了效率，但容易引入推理错误，且缺乏对性能损失的统计保证，特别是在高风险应用中。因此，需要一种能够在用户指定性能损失容忍度下进行有效控制的推理方法。

Method: 本研究提出了大概近似正确（PAC）推理方法，该方法通过构建性能损失的上置信界作为不确定性分数的单调函数，并设定切换模型的门限来动态切换思考和非思考模式。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够在推理任务中显著节约计算预算并控制用户指定的性能损失。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种新的PAC推理方法，通过构建性能损失的上置信界，并根据不确定性分数的单调函数来确定模型切换门限，能够在不依赖具体分布的情况下保证性能损失的可控性，并实际节约计算开支。实验表明，该方法在推理任务中有效实现了性能损失的控制和计算资源的节约。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

TL;DR: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，尤其影响土著和双性患者，需提高AI素养并呼吁开发者减少这些差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，公众可以轻松获得能以个性化方式回答大多数健康问题的应用。虽然LLMs在某些医疗能力方面超过了专业人士，但其评估严重缺乏对医疗的社会性质的洞察，忽视了社会群体间的健康差异及偏见可能如何影响用户并转化为LLM生成的医学建议。

Method: 通过模拟多个患者档案（性别、年龄段、种族变异）来提出一系列医学问题，进行自然语言特征对比分析，以探讨LLM生成的回答在人群间的差异性。

Result: 本研究发现LLM生成的反应在社会群体间存在系统性差异，尤其是土著和双性患者获得的建议可读性更差且更复杂。交叉群体中的这种趋势更加明显，强调了针对LLM使用者的AI素养提升以及开发者调查和缓解这些不平等现象的必要性。

Conclusion: 本论文得出结论，LLMs在生成医疗建议时，会根据患者的社会群体产生系统性不同的反应，尤其对于土著和双性患者，其建议的可读性更差、复杂性更高。这种趋势在交叉群体中更加明显，强调了需要提高AI素养，并且呼吁开发者进行调查和缓解，以确保减少这些系统性差异。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: In the field of medicine and healthcare, the utilization of medical
expertise, based on medical knowledge combined with patients' health
information is a life-critical challenge for patients and health professionals.
The within-laying complexity and variety form the need for a united approach to
gather, analyze, and utilize existing knowledge of medical treatments, and
medical operations to provide the ability to present knowledge for the means of
accurate patient-driven decision-making. One way to achieve this is the fusion
of multiple knowledge sources in healthcare. It provides health professionals
the opportunity to select from multiple contextual aligned knowledge sources
which enables the support for critical decisions. This paper presents multiple
conceptual models for knowledge fusion in the field of medicine, based on a
knowledge graph structure. It will evaluate, how knowledge fusion can be
enabled and presents how to integrate various knowledge sources into the

Motivation: 扩大现有研究边界，通过PSPACE-完全问题评估LLMs和LRMs的计算能力。

Result: 首次实证调查展示了LLMs和LRMs的空间计算限制，提供了评估高级推理能力的新框架。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了LLMs和LRMs在解决PSPACE-完全问题时的空间计算限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering
process to build the benchmark. We conduct extensive evaluations on 6 LLMs and
5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity
and repetition. With its well-defined structure and quantitative evaluation
metrics, this work presents the first empirical investigation into the spatial
computational limitations of LLMs and LRMs, offering a new framework for
evaluating their advanced reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在增强透明性和性能之间的权衡问题，尤其适用于需要透明度和能力并重的领域。

Method: 使用群稀疏惩罚对注意力机制进行控制，设计信息理论锚点，并动态注入规则。提供了严格的数学证明，建立了注意力集中在语义相关块的显式阈值条件。

Result: 证明了当群稀疏惩罚超过某些阈值时，模型的注意力机制集中在语义相关块上，达到低熵和高保真度，且误差可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 提出了一种新的框架，可控调整大型语言模型的内部表示，使其从局部（可解释的、基于规则的）编码到分布式（可推广、高效）编码。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型解决逻辑推理问题的内在机制。

Method: 提供低层次解释其内部表示和计算电路。

Result: 归纳头在规则完成和规则链步骤中起着核心作用。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型能够通过学习内在规则来解决演绎推理任务，而不仅仅作为统计学习者。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

Motivation: 经典约束编程模型无法处理可选访问或插入的启发式问题，因此需要一种新的方法来处理这些局限性。

Method: 正式化了序列变量在约束编程中的使用，描述了其域、更新操作，并引入了针对这种域的约束一致性水平。此外，设计了专门针对序列变量和车辆路径的全局约束。

Conclusion: 引入的序列变量有效简化了问题建模，并在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了具竞争力的计算性能。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Conclusion: Titans的Neural Memory组件在性能上优于仅依赖注意力机制的模型，彰显了该模型的创新潜力，但同时也指出了其在实际应用中的局限性，并为未来的研究提出了问题。

Abstract: By the end of 2024, Google researchers introduced Titans: Learning at Test

original description hinder reproducibility. In this work, we present a
lightweight reimplementation of Titans and conduct a comprehensive evaluation
on Masked Language Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and Recommendation tasks.
Our results reveal that Titans does not always outperform established baselines
due to chunking. However, its Neural Memory component consistently improves
performance compared to attention-only models. These findings confirm the
model's innovative potential while highlighting its practical limitations and
raising questions for future research.

Conclusion: GraphMERT模型成功解决了从文本语料库中自动生成高质量知识图谱的问题，实现了在领域特定知识图谱上的高准确性，并具有优越的符号表示能力，相比于传统大规模语言模型表现出更高的可靠性和有效性。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Conclusion: 通过对32个流行的大型语言模型（LLMs）进行基准测试，研究发现GPT-5达到了81.76百分位，表现强劲，但仍低于顶级人类选手通常超过90%的表现。而在开放权重推理模型中，GPT-OSS-120B仅达到了60百分位，显示出与前沿闭源模型间显著的能力差距。详细分析表明，稳健的推理模型更重视对问题的精确分析而非过度探索，建议未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

### [199] [Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08646)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Energy-Driven Steering (EDS) is introduced to enhance safety in LLMs while reducing false refusals, improving compliance significantly without altering model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current alignment techniques make large language models overly cautious, leading to false refusals of benign prompts. The motivation is to create a method that enhances safety while minimizing these false refusals.

Method: The method involves training a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to assign energy levels to different states of LLMs. The framework uses the gradient of the energy function during inference to steer the LLM's hidden states towards desirable response regions, ensuring helpful and safe outputs without fine-tuning the model.

Result: The EDS framework successfully reduces false refusal rates and improves model compliance, as evidenced by the increase in ORB-H benchmark compliance from 57.3% to 82.6%.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel framework, Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), which effectively reduces false refusal rates in large language models while maintaining safety. EDS dynamically adjusts the LLM's responses in real-time without changing its core model weights, resulting in substantial improvements in compliance rates.

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一种名为WILSON的诊断工具，旨在提高语言模型的可靠性和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种方法来解决大语言模型在实际应用中因无害编辑导致答案改变的问题。

Method: 使用简化的循环和重排序检查将内部表示转换为系统信号，与位置和层上的逆自由曲率图相结合，通过JVPs和Hutchinson探针计算。

Result: WILSON信号计算成本低，对于标准Transformer模型具有模型无关性，可作为阈值和CSV工件输出，用于在模型部署时保护RAG免受顺序效应，捕捉微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多回合对话环境，以及控制合并或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON提供了一套用于诊断大语言模型失效的后验工具，可以帮助提高模型的可靠性和吞吐量，而无需修改模型架构或训练方式。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Motivation: 语言增强的基础模型在开放环境中收集的小型任务特定支持数据集使其面临投毒攻击的风险，而现有的防御方法缺乏正式保证且容易受到未见过和自适应攻击的影响。因此，研究旨在填补基于LeFMs的单样本分类器在认证鲁棒性方面的关键空白。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的高维数据在科学领域中广泛存在，通过二维散点图可视化这些数据集是主要方法之一，但图中准确性难以视觉判断，因此使用质量指标来衡量投影的准确性。

Method: 使用分析和实证的方法调查尺度变化对归一化应力和KL散度的影响，并提出一种简单的技术使得这两个度量指标对尺度变化不敏感。

Result: 通过分析和实证研究显示了尺度变换如何改变归一化应力和KL散度值，并影响降维技术评估。提出的方法能够准确地反映预期行为。

Conclusion: 我们提出了一种简单技术，使得归一化应力和KL散度两个度量指标对尺度变化不敏感，并展示了其在一个小型基准测试中的预期行为。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

Motivation: 特征缓存假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，这并不总是适用。通过频域分析观察到低频成分具有较高相似性但连续性较差，而高频成分则相反。这些观察促使作者提出频率感知缓存（FreqCa）。

Method: 频域分析揭示特征模型不同频率带的动态特性，并提出频率感知缓存（FreqCa）和累计残差特征（CRF）缓存作为解决方案。

Result: 通过频率感知缓存和累计残差特征缓存，显著降低了内存占用，提高了在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit上的生成和编辑效果。实验结果证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

TL;DR: LENS方法通过对错误反应施加置信度加权惩罚来利用负样本，从而提高RLVR的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨负组是否可以在没有额外监督的情况下进行利用。

Method: 提出了 LENS （	extbf{L}ikelihood 	extbf{E}stimation with 	extbf{N}egative 	extbf{S}amples）方法，修改了 GRPO，通过对不正确生成分配非零、置信度相关的奖励，使负组变得有信息，并将之前浪费的样本转换为有用的梯度更新。

Result: 提出的 LENS 方法能够将负组转换为有用的信息，从而提高RLVR的效率和性能。

Conclusion: 在 MATH 基准上使用 Llama-3.1-8B 和 Qwen-2.5-3B，提出的 LENS 方法在较难的项目上显著超过了 GRPO 基线。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

TL;DR: 本文研究了ICL在时间变化通道均衡中的应用，提出利用注意力机制提升ICL在动态环境中的适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ICL均衡器主要是在静态通道内开发和评估的，本文研究ICL解决非平稳问题的能力，以时间变化通道均衡为切入点。

Method: 本文采用了设计有效注意力机制的原则性框架，并结合自适应信号处理算法进行更好的设计，例如从最小均方（LMS）自适应算法、西根均方（LRMS）公式或多步骤梯度更新中导出新的注意力变体。

Result: 实验结果表明，受经典自适应算法启发的注意力机制可以在动态环境中显著增强适应性和性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡方面具有很大的潜力。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: Instance discrimination uses transformations to learn invariant representations by treating instances as distinct classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn representations invariant to objects across different views.

Method: Stochastic transformations are applied to generate multiple views of instances.

Result: The model learns representations invariant to the underlying object.

Conclusion: Instance discrimination treats each instance as a distinct class to learn invariant representations.

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

Motivation: 尽管点预测器的反事实公平性研究广泛，但预测集的反事实公平性在公平决策中未被充分探索。为了填补这一空白，将合适概率预测与反事实公平性相结合，开发出新的方法。

Method: 开发了一种称为CF-CP（反事实公平合适概率预测）的新方法，通过对合格性评分的对称化，在保护属性干预下实现反事实公平，同时维持预测集的边际覆盖率。

Result: CF-CP在合成和真实数据集上的回归和分类任务中实现了预期的反事实公平性和目标覆盖率，并且预测集的尺寸增加很小。

Conclusion: CF-CP方法通过对合格性评分的对称化，实现了保护属性干预下的反事实公平预测集，并保持了边际覆盖属性。在实验中，CF-CP在合成和真实数据集的回归和分类任务中均实现了所需的反事实公平性和目标覆盖率，并且预测集大小仅有轻微增加。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了理论基础，解释了在推理时通过修改模型内部状态来有效控制大型语言模型行为的方法，这些方法基于transformer架构的基本计算逻辑，引出了一种计算性强的文本输入转化为可重复利用的权重更新的方法。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Motivation: 在数据和技术不断发展的时代，出现了能够处理大量数据和学习复杂的输入输出关系的大型黑箱模型。然而，这些模型由于无法解释预测过程，在高风险情况下使用时显得不够可靠。本文旨在探索能够解释模型预测过程的可解释人工智能方法，以提高模型的可信度和安全性。

Method: 本文采用SHAP分析方法来解释模型预测，并通过聚类SHAP值来分析数据。通过关联每个样本和特征的SHAP值，量化其对预测的贡献，再利用聚类方法将接收到相同预测且原因相似的样本进行分组，从而揭示不同样本得出相同预测的各种路径。除此之外，本文还提出了一种用于多分类的瀑布图的新泛化方法。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病病例研究，展示了该方法的有效性。实验数据来源于阿尔茨海默病神经影像计划（ADNI）数据库。结果表明，使用SHAP分析方法可以有效地解释模型预测，聚类SHAP值能够为数据分析提供有意义的洞察。

Conclusion: SHAP分析能够有效地解释大型黑箱模型的预测过程，增强其在高风险情况下的可靠性和可信度。同时，通过聚类SHAP值，可以揭示不同样本得出相同预测的原因，进一步提高数据分析的深度和广度。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Conclusion: RFOD在混合类型表格数据的异常检测上优于现有方法，不仅在检测准确率上表现更好，而且在数据类型的稳健性和可解释性上具备优势。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种端到端的“保形风险训练”方法，通过在模型训练或微调过程中通过保形OCE风险控制进行微分，实现了可证明的风险保证，同时在多个应用中显著改善了平均表现。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

TL;DR: 通过引入LOTION框架，利用随机舍入噪声平滑量化损失表面，保证优化器收敛，并通过实验证明其优于标准量化训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化目标优化面临挑战，因为量化器是分段常数，只在量化阈值有导数，此论文旨在提供保证收敛的方法。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑的启发，近似量化损失表面为连续损失表面，引入了一种平滑框架，使用非偏随机化舍入噪声替换原始量化损失。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成测试床和150M及300M参数语言模型中优于标准量化训练。

Conclusion: 引入了一种名为LOTION的低精度优化框架，通过随机化舍入噪声来平滑量化损失表面，并保证标准优化器汇聚到损失表面的局部最小值，同时保留原始量化损失的全局最小值。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的空间去混淆器方法，用于解决空间因果推断中的未测量因素和干扰问题，并通过条件变分自编码器（CVAE）进行非参数识别及效应估计提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间领域的因果推断面临两个相互交织的挑战：未测量的空间因子（如天气、空气污染或流动性）混淆处理和结果，以及来自附近处理的干扰违反标准无干扰假设。现有方法通常通过假设另一种来解决问题，而我们表明它们是深度相关的。

Method: 我们提出了空间去混淆器，这是一种两阶段方法，首先使用具有空间先验的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 我们经验性地扩展了用于空间混淆的基准套件SpaCE，以包括处理干扰，并表明通过真实世界数据集中的环境健康和社会科学领域，空间去混淆器始终提高了效应估计。

Conclusion: 我们的框架通过将干扰转化为多因信号，连接空间与去混淆文献，从而推进结构化数据的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合虚拟成像工具和强化学习的新方法，用于优化CT协议，提高了图像质量并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法需要对参数组合进行详尽测试，这往往不切实际，因此提出了高效优化CT协议的新方法。

Method: 引入了一种结合虚拟成像工具与强化学习的创新方法，通过Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent进行优化，最大化图像质量目标，即重建图像中肝病变的可检测性指数（d'）。

Result: 强化学习方法取得了全局最大d'值，并比详尽搜索减少了79.7%的步骤，展示了准确性和计算效率。

Conclusion: 集成虚拟成像工具与强化学习能够有效进行CT协议管理，展示了这种方法的潜力。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于Buckingham Pi定理的零样本转移方法，能够在不重新训练的情况下，将RL策略适应到具有不同物理参数的新环境中，并在各种上下文中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL策略通常无法泛化到具有不同物理参数的新机器人、任务或环境，这限制了其在现实世界中的适用性。

Method: 该方法通过Buckingham Pi定理，通过无量纲空间缩放其输入（观测）和输出（动作），无需重新训练，将预训练策略适应于新的系统环境。

Result: 结果显示，在动态相似的上下文中，缩放转移不会导致性能损失。此外，在非相似的上下文中，缩放策略始终优于简单转移，可以显著扩展原始策略有效的上下文范围。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，维数分析提供了一种强大且实用的工具来增强RL策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文引入了一种新的范式，将结构信息直接融入到大型语言模型（LLM）的编码过程中，通过两种主要方法进行实验验证，结果表明其在各种任务中均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大型语言模型（LLMs）一般只处理文本，忽视了如超链接或引文等结构信息的丰富背景，而这些信息在许多现实世界数据集中是至关重要的。因此，本文提出了一种新的范式，通过直接在LLM内部编码过程中整合这些结构关系来生成结构感知文本嵌入。

Method: 本文探讨了两种主要的处理方法：顺序连接（sequential concatenation）和并行缓存（parallel caching），并通过广泛的零样本实验来验证其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，结构感知方法在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务中比纯文本和传统后处理基线有更好的表现。此外，通过分析发现顺序连接适用于噪声多、适度长度的背景，而并行缓存更适合长信号强的背景，但容易受到干扰。同时，本文也提出并验证了两种有效技术：背景蒸馏（Context Distillation）和语义平衡（Semantic Balancing）来解决噪声结构数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 本文首次提供了对过程内结构感知编码的全面分析，为构建更强大、更具背景感知能力的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

TL;DR: The paper proposes TAPAS datasets to enhance AI research on LWE attacks by offering accessible data to AI practitioners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Due to the lack of accessible and comprehensive data on LWE for AI model training, the study aims to accelerate AI research on LWE attacks.

Method: The paper introduces the TAPAS datasets, a toolkit designed to facilitate AI-powered attacks by offering accessible LWE data for analysis and experimentation.

Result: The TAPAS datasets enable the prototyping of new approaches to crack LWE and establish performance baselines for these attacks.

Conclusion: TAPAS datasets have the potential to significantly advance AI research on attacks against LWE by providing accessible and comprehensive data for AI practitioners.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解在线教育中的学习者情绪对于提高参与度和个性化教学至关重要。现有方法依赖于静态融合策略，假设模态输入始终可靠，但这在现实学习环境中很少见。

Method: 该论文采用了一种名为Edu-EmotionNet的框架，通过临时情感演变和模态可靠性进行联合建模。该模型包括一个动态跨模态上下文共享的CMAA模块、一个根据置信度为每个模态分配权重的MIE，以及一个利用先前预测来保证时间一致性的TFL。该方法在经过重新标注的IEMOCAP和MOSEI教育子集上进行了评估。

Result: Edu-EmotionNet在IEMOCAP和MOSEI教育子集上获得了最先进的性能，并证明了其在应对缺失或噪音模态方面的强鲁棒性。可视化确认了它捕捉情感过渡并自适应地优先考虑可靠信号的能力。

Conclusion: 研究最终表明，Edu-EmotionNet在在线教育环境中对情感识别的有效性。它显示出对缺失或噪声模态的强鲁棒性，使其适合部署在实时学习系统中。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有的公平性研究主要集中在医学影像诊断任务上，而忽视了预后的场景，如疾病随时间发展的预测，因此有必要提出一个全面的框架来评估医学影像中的事件预测的公平性。

Method: 引入FairTTE框架，通过因果分析技术识别和量化嵌入在医疗影像数据集中的不同偏见来源，以进行系统的公平性分析。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见普遍存在于不同的成像模式中，并且当前的公平方法在消除这些偏见上效果有限。研究还发现，偏见来源与模型差距之间存在强烈关联。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在医疗影像的时间事件预测中，现有的公平性方法效果有限，并且在数据分布变化时保持公平性变得更加困难，强调了需要更强大的公平预测模型。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自监督对比学习（CL）和负样本监督对比学习（NSCL）的表示对齐，通过理论和实证展示了二者在表示层面的类似性和对齐，指出NSCL作为自监督与监督学习间的桥梁的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CL损失和NSCL损失在类数增大时表现相似，但在训练过程中表示是否保持一致性尚未解决，因此研究CL和NSCL在表示层面是否长期保持对齐。

Method: 本文通过分析共享随机性训练下的CL和NSCL模型的表示对齐来研究这一问题。利用相同的初始化、批次和增强，证明了CL和NSCL的相似度矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，并提供了对齐度量（如CKA和RSA）的高概率保证。最后，进行了实证验证。

Result: 研究表明，CL和NSCL的表示保持相似，特别是在条件合适时其相似度矩阵接近。参数空间的耦合不稳定，CL和NSCL权重的差异可能随着训练时间呈指数增长。实验证实了随着规模和温度的增加，CL-NSCL对齐得到加强。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实证验证，本文展示了CL和NSCL在表示级别上的对齐，指出NSCL比其他监督目标更紧密地跟踪CL，并将NSCL定位为自监督学习与监督学习之间的桥梁。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器的训练方法面临特征吸收问题，导致难以稳定地识别和分析模型行为，因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种新的训练方法Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM)，该方法通过跟踪激活幅度、频率以及重建贡献来动态调整特征选择，并应用统计阈值分割的概率掩模机制，构建更自然的特征选择过程。

Result: 通过在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验，ATM方法在维持良好重建质量的同时，实现了显著低于现有方法的吸收分数。

Conclusion: ATM方法有效解决了稀疏自编码器训练中的特征吸收问题，同时保持了良好的重建质量。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards struggle to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to issues such as inaccurate credit assignment and premature entropy collapse, which limits model performance.

Method: Attribution-based Contribution to Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework incorporating trajectory semantic segmentation and a difficulty-aware curriculum, with dynamic regulation of policy entropy.

Result: ACPO improves exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning models, with a factorized reward system that accurately quantifies hierarchical contribution, demonstrated through extensive experiments on benchmarks like AIME, MATH, and AMC.

Conclusion: ACPO significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing exploration and exploitation in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MAB问题分析主要从时间域和累积遗憾的角度展开，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，因此本文提出新的频域分析框架来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出频域分析框架，将多臂赌博机过程重新表述为信号处理问题，具体构建了频域赌博机模型，并证明了主要定理：UCB算法中的置信界在频域中等价于应用于不确定频谱成分的时间变化增益。

Conclusion: 这种新理论为基于频域分析的算法设计提供了基础，有望开发出能够动态调整参数的新一代算法。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过LLM和DDPG结合优化IoV中AoI的方法，实验表明能有效减少AoI并提供稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在车辆互联网（IoV）的半持久调度（SPS）中，由于数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关的信道不确定性导致的信息年龄（AoI）恶化的问题。

Method: 采用基于大型语言模型（LLM）和深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）的优化方法。首先建立受车辆速度、车辆密度和资源预留间隔（RRI）影响的AoI计算模型，然后设计双路径优化方案。该方案中，DDPG由状态空间和奖励函数引导，而LLM利用上下文学习生成最优参数配置。

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后无需模型训练即可显著减少AoI，而DDPG方法在训练后表现更为稳定。

Conclusion: 通过实验验证，LLM和DDPG结合的优化方法可以有效应对IoV中的AoI问题，提供稳定且优化的信息传递性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Motivation: 小规模地球数据往往具有时空相关性，进行准确预测对于理解地球科学过程至关重要。传统深度学习模型需要针对特定任务进行训练，而基础模型虽不需要特定任务训练却常对预训练分布的全局平均值存在偏差。

Method: 利用表格基础模型，对小规模地球数据的时空模式进行特征化和量化，通过比较不同场景下的预测结果来验证该方法的优势。

Result: 与图形深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）对比表明本文所提方法在多数实例中具有更高的预测精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种简单而稳健的时空相关小规模地球数据预测方法，通过表格基础模型对小规模地球数据进行准确定量和预测。在多个典型场景中，与图形深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）相比，该方法展现了更强的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Conclusion: AB-PINNs展示了在解决复杂多尺度偏微分方程方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Motivation: 解决在推理阶段因不常出现的特征组合导致的预测性能下降的问题。

Method: 引入了层次概率哈希方法来估计不同顺序特征组合的出现频率，然后以信心分数作为采样概率，通过迭代采样生成多个实例特定的推理路径，最终汇聚多个路径的预测分数以进行稳健预测。

Result: MATT在现有CTR模型中具有良好的兼容性和有效性，通过广泛的离线实验和在线A/B测试进行了强有力的验证。

Conclusion: 这项研究提出了一种新的模型无关测试时间范式（MATT），可以在现有CTR模型中有效地使用，提高预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时序列数据表现出非平稳行为、机制转换以及时变噪声（异方差性），这些因素会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了一种新的残差感知体系结构，即VARNN，用于监督时间序列回归。其通过从最近预测残差中学习显式误差记忆，并利用该记忆重新校准后续预测。VARNN通过添加一个学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤中的残差中更新，作为变化和漂移的信号，然后在当前时间步骤调整最终预测。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下能够提供稳健的预测，显示其在时间序列学习中的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI

learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

TL;DR: RLER enhances reinforcement learning by correcting biases in reward estimation, improving scalability and stability compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the system bias in reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards, which leads to biased and unstable reward estimation and affects training stability.

Method: Extensive experiments with reinforced learning using ensembled rewards that aggregate diverse models and adapt reward interpolation and rollout selection.

Result: RLER improves performance by 13.6% over RLIR and reduces the gap with RLVR to only 3.6%, achieving stable scaling in unlabeled settings.

Conclusion: RLER significantly improves performance and stability in reinforcement learning by mitigating model biases in reward estimation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Motivation: 现有的基于联邦学习的癫痫预测方法在异构客户设置下难以实现稳健的性能。因此需要一种新的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一个个性化的联邦学习框架FedL2T，该框架利用了两教师知识蒸馏策略。具体来说，每个客户同时从一个全局聚合模型和一个动态分配的同伴模型中学习。FedL2T还采用了自适应的多级蒸馏策略，并引入了一个邻近正则化项以增强训练稳定性。

Result: FedL2T在两个EEG数据集上的广泛实验表明其持续优于最先进的联邦学习方法，尤其是在低标记条件下。此外，FedL2T表现出快速且稳定的收敛性能，减少了通信轮次和相关开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T能够在隐私敏感的医疗环境下提供可靠且个性化的癫痫预测解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to align plans with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints in complex, multi-step domains, as existing approaches yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps.

Method: The proposed method is Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), integrated into Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs that prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions.

Result: Const-o-T outperforms baselines in Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment.

Conclusion: Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T) offers a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在低质量或扰动的忘记数据集情况下，遗忘能力依然稳健，关键在于语义信号的保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型展现出的生成能力，伴随出现的伦理和安全问题也越来越受到关注，尤其是涉及到敏感数据的记忆、偏见的强化和产生有害内容。为此，研究者们开始关注如何从预训练模型中去除与不良数据相关的知识。

Method: 该研究系统性地对现有最先进的语言模型遗忘方法RMU和NPO进行了基准测试，尤其是在噪声遗忘集上进行测试。

Result: 研究发现语言模型的遗忘对于低质量或扰动的忘记数据集依然具有鲁棒性，只要核心语义信号得以保留。为了解释这一鲁棒性，研究提出了一种基于显著性的解释，认为驱动遗忘的关键语义成分在表面形式显著变化的情况下仍然保持一致的影响力，表明遗忘算法主要由深层语义线索指导而非浅层的词汇模式。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，即使在低保真度或受扰动的忘记数据集情况下，语言模型的遗忘能力仍然具有鲁棒性，关键在于保留核心语义信号。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

Motivation: Transformer架构的大模型由于极端token现象而导致性能下降、量化保真度差和可解释性差。需要一个机制来高效执行"无操作"注意力，以打破模型学习无用行为的循环。

Method: 提出了价值状态门控注意力（VGA）机制，通过直接从价值向量计算的可学习门控来调节输出，从而有效打破模型学习"无操作"行为的循环。

Result: VGA显著减轻了注意力陷阱的形成，稳定了价值状态规范，从而提高了模型的性能、量化保真度和模型可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过引入VGA机制，显著缓解了注意力陷阱现象，并稳定了价值状态规范，从而提高了模型性能、量化保真度和解释性。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

Method: MagicDock采用渐进式管道和可微表面建模，通过绑定预测的反向梯度流引导配体的de novo生成，并强调在对接过程中使用可学习的3D点云来精确捕捉绑定细节。

Result: 在9种场景下的广泛实验表明，MagicDock在蛋白质或分子配体设计方面分别实现了27.1%和11.7%的平均改善。

Conclusion: 本文提出的MagicDock通过提出渐进式管道和可微表面建模，有效解决了伪诺奖、有限对接模型以及不灵活的配体类型问题，且在广泛的应用场景中证明了其超越现有基准的有效性。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

Method: 估计著名人工智能系统在过去十年中训练过程的环境影响，包括大型语言模型，重点分析显卡整个生命周期。

Result: 显卡生产的影响稳步增加，机器学习模型训练的能耗和环境影响呈指数增长；优化策略没有缓解训练带来的影响。

Conclusion: 提高效率并不能确保机器学习的可持续性，减轻人工智能的环境影响需要减少人工智能活动，并质疑资源密集型训练的规模和频率。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 现有评估方法不适用于适应性攻击者，需考虑更强的攻击测试防御稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了改进语言模型防御的稳健性评估，应当考虑能够针对防御设计修改攻击策略的适应性攻击者。

Method: 通过系统调试和扩大通用优化技术（包括梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）来探查防御的漏洞。

Result: 成功绕过12种近期的防御措施，对于大多数防御，攻击成功率超过90%，而这些防御措施原报告几乎为零的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 目前的评估方法有缺陷，应针对能够适应性修改攻击策略的攻击者来评估语言模型防御的稳健性。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

TL;DR: IGCARL enhances autonomous driving robustness against strategic adversaries, improving safety and reliability, with significant experimental success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite existing robust methods, issues such as limited responses to strategic threats, inability to cause safety-critical events, and learning instability remain.

Method: The paper introduces IGCARL, which involves a strategic targeted adversary exploiting temporal decision-making and a robust driving agent optimized under a constrained formulation.

Result: IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9% compared to existing methods, proving effective in handling adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: IGCARL significantly improves robustness against adversarial attacks, enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Method: 使用分割技术作为数据预处理步骤，并结合异构集成方法进行异常检测。

Result: 通过引入分割技术，AUC-ROC指标从0.8599提高到0.9760。

Conclusion: 通过在异常检测前引入时间序列分割技术，可以显著提高模型性能。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Method: 本文提出了一种基于帧级标记修剪的CTC解码算法——FLToP CTC，通过相对阈值概率指导帧级标记修剪，动态消除每帧低概率标记，降低计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech测试中，FLToP CTC相较于标准CTC解码器，实现了10.5倍的运行时间加速和2.78倍的内存减少，同时保持可忽略的WER下降。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC算法有效解决了CTC解码器的计算和内存瓶颈问题，使其在资源受限环境中的可扩展性得到提升，同时也提高了实时应用中的语音识别可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Motivation: 随着对大型预训练模型应用于生物信号解码和解释的兴趣增加，传统的高维噪声时间序列数据处理方法已不能满足需求，因此需要新的技术来处理这些复杂数据。

Method: 文章介绍了一种新的表示学习框架BioCodec，它受到神经编码器启发，以离散令牌形式捕获低级信号特征。BioCodec对数千小时的脑电图数据进行预训练，并在多项下游任务中显示出高效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为BioCodec的替代表示学习框架，能够有效地处理脑电图（EEG）和其他生物信号数据，表现同样竞争于当前最先进的模型。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Conclusion: AdaPM方法通过偏置修正技术来增强部分动量，能够在保持效率和性能的同时，大幅降低动量的内存需求，并在优化器状态中实现高达95%的内存节省，节省超过30%的GPU训练时间。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

Conclusion: 我们的方法提供了更严格的组隐私风险测量，可靠地评估组隐私风险中的差异，同时通过自适应组特定梯度裁剪策略增强了DP-SGD算法，减少了组隐私风险中的差异，提高了DPML中的隐私保护公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Conclusion: 本文提出了在信息反馈延迟情况下解决CMAB问题的最优后悔最小化算法，提供了两种不同情况下的后悔界限，完善了理论分析。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在后训练中常常面临专业领域改进与一般能力损失之间的权衡。现有解决方案尝试通过正则化、选择性参数更新或数据中心重播来缓解这一紧张关系，但每种方法都在计算、数据访问或适应性上造成显著成本。

Method: 引入Logits Replay + MoClip，两阶段框架通过在logit空间中压缩监督信号，在更新层面稳定优化。在Stage 0中记录覆盖概率阈值的动态Top-K标记子集，始终包括金标。Stage 1中重播紧凑子集以计算精确的重新归一化损失，避免完全softmax计算并进行隐含正则化。设计MoClip优化器，通过限制梯度动量旋转并应用基于arctan2的更新缩放以确保稳定性。

Result: 实验证明，所提出的方法在通信技术(CT)和NL2SQL任务中的领域性能有所提升，同时在一般基准(MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH)上减轻遗忘现象，并减少超过40%的训练成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法为LLM的领域适应提供了可扩展和与架构无关的路径，同时不牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

*Jing Li,Zhijie Sun,Zhicheng Zhou,Suming Qiu,Junjie Huang,Haijia Sun,Linyuan Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR framework improves dynamic interaction between LLMs and KGs using multi-round reinforcement learning, enhancing performance in knowledge extraction and QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs that use static knowledge bases face limitations in coverage and temporal obsolescence, reducing their effectiveness in dynamic environments.

Method: The paper introduces a framework called Agentic-KGR involving multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Key innovations include dynamic schema expansion, retrieval-augmented memory, and multi-scale prompt compression to enhance language models in knowledge environments.

Result: Agentic-KGR achieves substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round RL in knowledge extraction tasks. Integrated with GraphRAG, it enhances performance in QA tasks in terms of accuracy and knowledge coverage.

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR exhibits significant improvements in knowledge extraction tasks and downstream QA tasks when compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

*Tianyi Chen,Mingcheng Zhu,Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文比较了多种EHR表示方法，发现事件流模型表现最佳，特征选择策略需因应临床背景而不同。CLMBR模型在小样本环境下表现优异，计数模型在数据充足时也有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然电子健康记录（EHRs）促进了临床预测中的深度学习，但如何最佳地表示患者数据仍不明确，因为评价实践不一致。本文旨在通过系统性基准测试来比较EHR表示方法，为临床预测提供标准化的数据策划和评价标准。

Method: 研究使用了基准测试系统来比较多种EHR表示方法，包括多变量时间序列、事件流和适用于LLMs的文本事件流。数据标准化涵盖了两个临床环境：MIMIC-IV数据集用于ICU任务预测（如死亡率、表型），以及EHRSHOT数据集用于长期护理（如再入院率、胰腺癌）。在每种范式中，评估对应的模型类型--包括用于时间序列的Transformer、MLP、LSTM和Retain，用于事件流的CLMBR和计数模型，以及用于文本流的8-20B LLMs。同时，分析基于数据缺失情况的特征修剪对结果的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示事件流模型持续表现出最强的性能。预训练的CLMBR在小样本情况下非常高效，而简单的计数模型在数据充足时也有竞争力。特征选择策略需根据临床设置进行调整：修剪稀疏特征可改善ICU预测，但在长期任务中保留这些特征很关键。

Conclusion: 事件流模型在预测表现上优于其他模型，尤其是在样本较少的情况下，预训练的CLMBR模型表现出色。而简单的计数模型在数据充足时也具有较强的竞争力。不同临床设置下特征选择策略的适应性至关重要：稀疏特征的修剪有助于ICU预测，而保留这些特征对长期任务至关重要。研究结果为根据临床情境和数据情况选择EHR表示方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

Motivation: 探讨如何合并训练模型以提高其鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 提出了一个层次模型合并方案，比标准的MergeMany算法表现更优。

Result: 层次合并方案中参与的模型越多，对抗性和扰动鲁棒性效果越显著。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin引入了对抗性和扰动鲁棒性，但在实验中表现出比原始作者报告的更显著的性能下降。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

Motivation: 深度学习中的非确定性和不可重复性导致结果不一致的问题。

Method: 引入RepDL库，通过对浮点数计算进行正确舍入和顺序不变来确保训练和推断的一致性。

Result: RepDL库可以在不同的计算环境中实现深度学习训练和推断的一致性。

Conclusion: 深度学习中的随机数生成和浮点数计算导致结果不一致，通过RepDL库可以解决浮点数计算的一致性问题。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

*Yumin Choi,Dongki Kim,Jinheon Baek,Sung Ju Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO) for optimizing multimodal prompts, outperforming text-only methods and enhancing MLLMs' capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The limitation of current prompt optimization approaches to text only, despite the broader capabilities of MLLMs, led to the need for multimodal prompt optimization.

Method: MPO performs joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates and uses a Bayesian-based selection strategy leveraging earlier evaluations as priors.

Result: MPO demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments across various modalities beyond text, such as images, videos, and molecules.

Conclusion: MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a key step in realizing the full potential of MLLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种结合教师FM模型与学生简单MLP结构的方法，解决了FM策略的在线互动和探索问题，从而显著增强学习效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FM模型在离线模仿学习中表现强劲，但其缺乏环境交互和探索能力，导致在超出专家演示的场景中泛化性较差。因此，有必要进行在线环境交互以提高泛化能力。然而，FM策略的在线优化因为梯度计算的不稳定性和高推理成本而复杂且低效。

Method: 我们使用了一种教师-学生模型，其中学生策略采用简单的MLP结构，通过奖励模型来进行在线更新，奖励模型与教师FM模型相关联。通过这种方式，学生可以规避FM策略中的梯度不稳定性，实现高效的在线探索，同时教师模型提供专家数据分布的表达能力以规范学生策略行为。

Result: 通过实验验证，我们的方法在提高学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性方面表现突出。尤其是在从次优专家数据中学习时，效果更为显著。

Conclusion: 我们的策略不仅解决了FM策略在线互动的挑战，同时大大提高了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，尤其是在从次优专家数据中学习时。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型虽可预测化学反应，但缺乏透明性和可解释性。

Method: 提出主要蕴含解释并开发计算这些解释的算法。

Result: 主要蕴含解释可以保守地捕获反应预测的真实解释。

Conclusion: 主要蕴含解释尽管有冗余信息，但能有效捕捉预测反应所需的分子特征。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Result: 通过实验证明了所提出方法在合成和真实世界数据集上的特性。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种公平且时间敏感的数据共享框架，能够根据参与方加入的时间来确定激励措施，并在合成和真实数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

Conclusion: 实施完全独立于模型的黑箱安全对齐框架是可行的。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准指标往往不能反映人类偏好，人类评估虽然可靠但代价高且噪声大，因此需要改进的方法来更好地聚合评估结果。

Method: 引入BBQ，一种贝叶斯Bradley-Terry变体，显式建模评价者质量，通过一个期望最大化算法实现单调似然收敛的保证。

Result: 实证结果表明，即使在有噪声或众包的评价者情况下，BBQ比基准Bradley-Terry模型实现更快的收敛、更精确的校准不确定性估计和更稳健、可解释的排名。

Conclusion: BBQ框架通过对生成模型的人类评价提供了一种更可靠、更具成本效益的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

TL;DR: 研究表明，使用全Gauss-Newton预条件法对于加速模型训练非常有效，较之现有方法可显著减少迭代次数，且逐层Hessian结构已经包含较为充分的信息以获取性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在大规模训练中因使用近似算法而损失的性能问题，研究者们致力于通过利用二阶结构来加速大型语言模型（LLM）的预训练。

Method: 研究者采用全Gauss-Newton (GN)预条件法应用于高达150M参数的transformer模型，以建立迭代复杂性的实践上限。

Result: 全GN更新相比现有优化器带来了显著的收益，训练迭代次数比诸如SOAP和Muon等强基准减少了5.4倍。此外，忽略跨层信息但精确的逐层GN预条件方法的性能几乎与全GN方法相匹配。

Conclusion: GN近似对于预条件化非常有效，这意味着更高阶的损失项可能对收敛速度并非至关重要；逐层的Hessian结构包含足够的信息以实现大部分潜在的收益；当前的近似方法与理想化的逐层预言机之间存在显著的性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感识别中的课程学习方法依赖于启发式、数据驱动或基于模型的样本困难度定义，忽略了人类感知的困难度，这对于像情感识别这样的主观任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种感知驱动的课程学习框架CHUCKLE，利用众包数据集中标注者的共识和一致性来定义样本困难度，假设对人类感知具有挑战性的片段对机器学习模型也同样困难。

Result: 实证结果表明，与非课程基线相比，CHUCKLE使LSTM的相对平均准确率提高了6.56%，Transformer提高了1.61%，同时减少了梯度更新次数，从而提高了训练效率和模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE框架通过将样本困难度定义为人类感知的困难度，提高了情感识别模型的训练效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

TL;DR: The paper presents HINT, a novel framework offering heuristic hints to improve RL models' performance and stability in complex reasoning tasks, with proven success in mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address failures in reinforcement learning models when dealing with complex tasks that exceed their capabilities, which result in reward sparsity and inefficient training due to a large distribution mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.

Method: The paper introduces an adaptive hinting framework called HINT, which provides heuristic hints rather than direct answers to guide models effectively. Additionally, a new metric, Affinity, is introduced to monitor exploration efficiency and training stability.

Result: HINT demonstrates improved performance and state-of-the-art results across various model scales in mathematical reasoning tasks, offering more stable learning and better data efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: HINT consistently improves the performance and learning stability of reinforcement learning models in long chain-of-thought reasoning tasks, especially in mathematical reasoning, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Motivation: 在线随机匹配问题在用户与臂之间进行匹配以最大化奖励，但由于缺乏结构假设，最优匹配计算是NP困难的，因此在线学习的计算变得不可行。为了克服这一障碍，本文关注单峰偏好这一社会选择理论中的结构。

Method: 本文利用了一种新的基于PQ树的顺序逼近方法，并设计了离线预算匹配问题的有效算法，进而用于在线算法。

Result: 本文提出的在线算法在单峰偏好的情况下，可以达到遗憾界限为 $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$ 的在线算法，而在已知单峰结构的情况下，则可以实现遗憾界限为 $\tilde O(U\sqrt{TK})$ 的UCB样算法。

Conclusion: 本文通过利用单峰偏好结构，设计了在线学习的有效算法，并在已知单峰结构的情况下实现了较低的遗憾界限。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS is an unsupervised framework that compresses time series data efficiently, achieves high performance with reduced computational costs, and improves noise robustness by leveraging latent temporal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models handle time series data inefficiently, treating all time steps as equally informative and failing to leverage latent temporal structures, leading to poor robustness and scalability issues.

Method: STaTS employs a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion to detect change points at multiple temporal resolutions and summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs.

Result: STaTS achieves up to 30x compression of time series data while retaining core temporal dynamics and maintaining 85-90% of full-model performance. It also outperforms uniform and clustering-based compression baselines by improving robustness under noise and preserving discriminative structures.

Conclusion: STaTS offers a principled and general-purpose solution for efficient and structure-aware time series modeling, improving robustness and preserving discriminative structure while significantly reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Orthogonal Alignment in cross-attention naturally enhances model performance and efficiency in cross-domain recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand the mechanism behind cross-attention and discover how Orthogonal Alignment can improve cross-domain sequential recommendation.

Method: Conduct over 300 experiments to analyze the effects of query and output orthogonality on model performance in cross-attention.

Result: Models with Orthogonal Alignment improved performance and accuracy-per-model parameter compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Orthogonal Alignment in cross-attention improves scaling laws and model accuracy without explicit orthogonality constraints.

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

TL;DR: 均匀缩放流（USFs）有效连接深度单类分类与归一化流，实现更好的异常检测性能与理论统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了统一无监督异常检测中两个主要范式——深度单类分类和密度估计，探索能否通过均匀缩放流（USFs）有效连接这两者并提升异常检测性能。

Method: 利用均匀缩放流（USFs）进行最大似然训练，将其简化为具有独特正则化的深度SVDD目标，并在多个基准和模型骨干上进行实证测试。

Result: USFs在负对数似然和潜在范数之间诱导了更紧密的对齐，并展示了性能的显著提升和训练稳定性的显著改善。

Conclusion: 这项研究通过引入均匀缩放流（USFs）连接了深度单类分类和归一化流的密度估计方法，提出USFs可以作为现代异常检测架构中的非USFs的直接替代品，带来一致的性能提升和更稳健的训练。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

TL;DR: 研究自适应攻击，揭露监控模型在当前AI控制协议中的盲点，应成为评估标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究一种自适应攻击的方法，即不受信任的模型知道协议和监控模型的情况下进行攻击，且可能情况下不受信任的模型是在更晚的知识截止点训练的或能够自行搜索这些信息。

Method: 模拟一种简单的自适应攻击向量，通过攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零次跳转的提示注入。

Result: 利用这种策略，前沿模型始终能够规避各种监控并在两个主要AI控制基准测试中完成恶意任务。攻击普遍适用于依赖监控的当前协议。甚至最近的“推迟重采样”协议由于其重采样放大了提示注入，有效地将其重新定义为n次最佳攻击。

Conclusion: 自适应攻击对监控模型的漏洞利用代表了当前控制协议中的一个重大盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Result: 我们的方法在各种经过训练的自编码器上进行了评估，涉及合成和真实数据。

Conclusion: 我们的框架通过在潜在流形上进行Riemannian指数映射来计算连接给定端点的测地路径，并能够进行测地线的发射。

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Result: 我们得到了一种简单的闭式表达式，用于局部极小极大最优采样器，并通过实验证明这种方案在使用公共数据建模私有采样时，比当前的全局方法有更好的表现。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入局部框架，证明了局部极小极大风险可以通过限制分布类至邻域来由全球极小极大风险决定，这为私有采样提供了一种更接近现实数据的方式，提升了采样的性能。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention
mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the
identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation
involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances
and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through
experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our
theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism.
Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the
model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging
toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity
under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at
low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of
softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust
normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

*Ilia Revin,Leon Strelkov,Vadim A. Potemkin,Ivan Kireev,Andrey Savchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PETRA is an AutoML framework that optimizes neural networks, significantly reducing size and latency while increasing throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to optimize neural network models to meet the growing demands for scalability and resource efficiency across various applications.

Method: The paper introduces PETRA, an AutoML framework that uses evolutionary optimization, pruning, quantization, and loss regularization to enhance neural network models.

Result: PETRA reduces model size by up to 75%, latency by up to 33%, and increases throughput by 13%, all without degrading performance metrics.

Conclusion: PETRA effectively improves neural model performance and scalability, achieving a significant reduction in model size and latency, and an increase in throughput without quality loss.

Abstract: There are many critical challenges in optimizing neural network models,
including distributed computing, compression techniques, and efficient
training, regardless of their application to specific tasks. Solving such
problems is crucial because the need for scalable and resource-efficient models
is increasing. To address these challenges, we have developed a new automated
machine learning (AutoML) framework, Parameter Efficient Training with Robust
Automation (PETRA). It applies evolutionary optimization to model architecture
and training strategy. PETRA includes pruning, quantization, and loss
regularization. Experimental studies on real-world data with financial event
sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target
metric.

*Nathan Quiblier,Roy Friedman,Matthew Ricci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个新的图形化模型MODE，成功应对生命科学中动态系统的复杂行为模式转换问题，并能预测细胞命运。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统通常由复杂的重叠行为模式组成。这些模式的转换可能显得嘈杂且不规律，对传统的基于流动的建模技术构成了严峻挑战。该研究旨在通过提出新的建模框架来应对这些挑战。

Method: 该研究提出了MODE（动态专家混合）的图形化建模框架，该框架的神经门控机制能够将复杂动态分解为稀疏易解释的组件，从而能够在不需要监督的情况下发现行为模式，并在行为模式转换过程中实现准确的长期预测。

Result: 在合成数据集和真实数据集上的实验评估表明，MODE在无监督分类任务及预测任务中表现优良，尤其是处理嘈杂过渡时效果显著。

Conclusion: MODE能够成功区分细胞增殖和分化动态，并预测细胞承诺其最终命运的时间，这在计算生物学领域是一个重要的挑战。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

### [289] [BaNEL: Exploration Posteriors for Generative Modeling Using Only Negative Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09596)
*Sangyun Lee,Brandon Amos,Giulia Fanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BaNEL effectively boosts generative models' success rate on difficult tasks with sparse rewards by learning from failures, reducing reward evaluation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in scenarios where generative models receive near-zero reward signals and reward evaluations are costly, particularly in solving important yet difficult problems.

Method: BaNEL post-trains the model using only failed attempts, minimizing the number of reward evaluations by casting the learning of failure regularities as an in-loop generative modeling problem.

Result: BaNEL improves model performance on sparse-reward tasks without needing successful samples; it outperforms novelty-bonus approaches significantly in success rates.

Conclusion: BaNEL can improve model performance significantly on sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing methods by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate while using fewer reward evaluations.

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper examines the role of MLLMs in UI design evaluation, finding they partially align with human judgments but have limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can serve as early evaluators by mimicking human preferences in UI assessment, potentially aiding in narrowing design options before formal user testing.

Method: The study benchmarked GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama using data from a crowdsourcing platform on 30 interfaces, analyzing alignment with human judgments on various UI factors.

Result: MLLMs showed alignment with human judgments on certain UI evaluation dimensions but diverged on others, indicating mixed effectiveness in emulating human preferences.

Conclusion: MLLMs approximated human preferences on some UI dimensions but showed differences on others, highlighting both their potential and limitations for early UX research.

Abstract: In an ideal design pipeline, user interface (UI) design is intertwined with
user research to validate decisions, yet studies are often resource-constrained
during early exploration. Recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) offer a promising opportunity to act as early evaluators, helping
designers narrow options before formal testing. Unlike prior work that
emphasizes user behavior in narrow domains such as e-commerce with metrics like
clicks or conversions, we focus on subjective user evaluations across varied
interfaces. We investigate whether MLLMs can mimic human preferences when
evaluating individual UIs and comparing them. Using data from a crowdsourcing
platform, we benchmark GPT-4o, Claude, and Llama across 30 interfaces and
examine alignment with human judgments on multiple UI factors. Our results show
that MLLMs approximate human preferences on some dimensions but diverge on
others, underscoring both their potential and limitations in supplementing
early UX research.

Conclusion: Green Grid通过整合AI与区块链技术，有望显著提升电子废物的透明处理及再生率，推动印度走向循环经济。

Abstract: Electronic waste (e-waste) is a rapidly growing global problem caused by
shorter device lifecycles and rising consumption. India ranks third globally in
e-waste generation, producing over 1.7 million tonnes in 2023-24, of which less
than half is formally processed. To address this, we propose Green Grid, an
integrated AI-powered e-waste management platform combining IoT-enabled smart
collection, AI-based device classification, blockchain-based traceability, and
gamified citizen engagement. The system features smart recycling bins with
sensors for real-time monitoring, deep learning models for device
identification and sorting, a blockchain ledger for tamper-proof tracking, and
a reward-based mobile or web app to encourage user participation. Additionally,
Green Grid offers analytics dashboards and an eco-marketplace to support
policymakers and recyclers. By bridging technology, sustainability, and
community participation, the platform enhances transparency, increases formal
recycling rates, and advances India's transition toward a circular economy.

Abstract: Natural language-based user profiles in recommender systems have been
explored for their interpretability and potential to help users scrutinize and
refine their interests, thereby improving recommendation quality. Building on
this foundation, we introduce a human-AI collaborative profile for a movie
recommender system that presents editable personalized interest summaries of a

eight-week online field deployment with 1775 active movie recommender users, we
find persistent gaps between user-perceived and system-inferred interests, show
how the profile encourages engagement and reflection, and identify design
directions for leveraging imperfect AI-powered user profiles to stimulate more

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化技术在创建有效分类器时，未能考虑社交媒体用户希望在使用过程中不断调整过滤器的需求。

Method: 引入一种用户中心的提示优化技术Promptimizer，该技术允许用户输入优化过程，并生成可解释的最终提示。

Result: 实验表明，用户显著偏好Promptimizer的人机互动优化方式；在3周的试验中，YouTube内容创作者成功创建了多样化的过滤器，以便更好地理解受众和保护社区。

Conclusion: Promptimizer技术不仅提高了分类器的性能，还增强了用户的优化过程参与度。用户更喜欢这种人机交互的优化方式，而不是完全自动化的方法。

Abstract: While LLMs now enable users to create content classifiers easily through
natural language, automatic prompt optimization techniques are often necessary
to create performant classifiers. However, such techniques can fail to consider
how social media users want to evolve their filters over the course of usage,
including desiring to steer them in different ways during initialization and
iteration. We introduce a user-centered prompt optimization technique,
Promptimizer, that maintains high performance and ease-of-use but additionally
(1) allows for user input into the optimization process and (2) produces final
prompts that are interpretable. A lab experiment (n=16) found that users
significantly preferred Promptimizer's human-in-the-loop optimization over a
fully automatic approach. We further implement Promptimizer into Puffin, a tool
to support YouTube content creators in creating and maintaining personal
classifiers to manage their comments. Over a 3-week deployment with 10
creators, participants successfully created diverse filters to better
understand their audiences and protect their communities.

Motivation: 本研究旨在探讨RDWT作为脑电图解码的预处理步骤对深度学习分类器性能的影响。

Method: 使用RDWT作为中的预处理步骤，并在四种深度学习架构上进行有无RDWT的系统评估。

Result: RDWT在BCI-IV-2a数据集上能够显著提高EEGTCNet和MBEEG\_SENet的性能，并在BCI-IV-2b和HGD数据集中也显示出一致的性能改善。

Conclusion: RDWT是一种低成本、高效的预处理技术，能在深度模型上实现性能提升。

Abstract: The present study investigates the impact of the Rational Discrete Wavelet
Transform (RDWT), used as a plug-in preprocessing step for motor imagery
electroencephalographic (EEG) decoding prior to applying deep learning
classifiers. A systematic paired evaluation (with/without RDWT) is conducted on
four state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet,
MBEEG\_SENet, and EEGTCNet. This evaluation was carried out across three
benchmark datasets: High Gamma, BCI-IV-2a, and BCI-IV-2b. The performance of
the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's
kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is
beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44
percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with
smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58
pp; +0.008). On BCI-IV-2b, the enhancements observed are modest yet consistent
for EEGNet (+0.21 pp; +0.044) and EEGTCNet (+0.28 pp; +0.077). On HGD, average
effects are modest to positive, with the most significant gain observed for
MBEEG\_SENet (+1.65 pp; +0.022), followed by EEGNet (+0.76 pp; +0.010) and
EEGTCNet (+0.54 pp; +0.008). Inspection of the subject material reveals
significant enhancements in challenging recordings (e.g., non-stationary
sessions), indicating that RDWT can mitigate localized noise and enhance
rhythm-specific information. In conclusion, RDWT is shown to be a low-overhead,
architecture-aware preprocessing technique that can yield tangible gains in
accuracy and agreement for deep model families and challenging subjects.

Result: 研究揭示了教师在实施紧急教学设计时遇到的五个主要障碍，提出了针对这些困难的解决方案建议。

Conclusion: 提出了一套紧急教学设计模型，用于指导教师在没有对商业接口控制权的情况下进行学生与AI工具的互动设计。研究发现了五个主要障碍，并提出了针对HCI研究人员、学术机构和组织的建议，以帮助教师更好地适应Generative AI工具在课程中的应用。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are increasingly pervasive, pushing instructors
to redesign how students use GenAI tools in coursework. We conceptualize this
work as emergency pedagogical design: reactive, indirect efforts by instructors
to shape student-AI interactions without control over commercial interfaces. To
understand practices of lead users conducting emergency pedagogical design, we
conducted interviews (n=13) and a survey (n=169) of computing instructors.
These instructors repeatedly encountered five barriers: fragmented buy-in for
revising courses; policy crosswinds from non-prescriptive institutional
guidance; implementation challenges as instructors attempt interventions;
assessment misfit as student-AI interactions are only partially visible to
instructors; and lack of resources, including time, staffing, and paid tool
access. We use these findings to present emergency pedagogical design as a
distinct design setting for HCI and outline recommendations for HCI
researchers, academic institutions, and organizations to effectively support
instructors in adapting courses to GenAI.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了消费级等距设备能够可靠地诱导和测量分级伪触觉反馈，而无需专门的激励器，这为开发经济实惠的康复工具、训练模拟器和辅助接口打开了一条道路。

Abstract: Pseudo-haptics exploit carefully crafted visual or auditory cues to trick the
brain into "feeling" forces that are never physically applied, offering a
low-cost alternative to traditional haptic hardware. Here, we present a
comparative psychophysical study that quantifies how visual and auditory
stimuli combine to evoke pseudo-haptic pressure sensations on a commodity
tablet. Using a Unity-based Rollball game, participants (n = 4) guided a
virtual ball across three textured terrains while their finger forces were
captured in real time with a Robotous RFT40 force-torque sensor. Each terrain
was paired with a distinct rolling-sound profile spanning 440 Hz - 4.7 kHz, 440
Hz - 13.1 kHz, or 440 Hz - 8.9 kHz; crevice collisions triggered additional
"knocking" bursts to heighten realism. Average tactile forces increased
systematically with cue intensity: 0.40 N, 0.79 N and 0.88 N for visual-only
trials and 0.41 N, 0.81 N and 0.90 N for audio-only trials on Terrains 1-3,
respectively. Higher audio frequencies and denser visual textures both elicited
stronger muscle activation, and their combination further reduced the force
needed to perceive surface changes, confirming multisensory integration. These
results demonstrate that consumer-grade isometric devices can reliably induce
and measure graded pseudo-haptic feedback without specialized actuators,
opening a path toward affordable rehabilitation tools, training simulators and
assistive interfaces.

patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and
dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising
avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing
singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support
without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological
framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic
Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of
a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address
a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and
multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data
interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized,
interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver
and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced
Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of
each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large
language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration
frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded
responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing,
and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural
blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond
single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework
establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and
proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for
future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient
outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.

Abstract: Inspired by the principle of self-regulating cooperation in collective
institutions, we propose the Group Relative Policy Optimization with Global
Cooperation Constraint (GRPO-GCC) framework. This work is the first to
introduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep
reinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates
group relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that
strengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them
at extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable
collective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or
unconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by
combining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL
penalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative
payoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized
policy adaptation, and long-term sustainability. GRPO-GCC demonstrates how a
simple yet global signal can reshape incentives toward resilient cooperation,
and provides a new paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in
socio-technical systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and
autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while
avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global
information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality
solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to
the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely,
distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based
methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information
availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these
limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path
planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to
adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static
conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared
information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We
empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its
planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing
compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently
finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios
having higher agent counts.
