### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 介绍了iFlyBot-VLA，一个新颖的VLA模型，通过双层表示框架和混合训练策略，在操控任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够有效理解和生成复杂操作的视觉-语言-动作模型，以增强3D感知和推理能力。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的框架，结合了潜在动作模型和双层动作表示框架，同时使用混合训练策略。

Result: 在LIBERO Franka基准测试中展现了优越性，并在真实世界评估中取得了竞争力的成功率。

Conclusion: iFlyBot-VLA模型在多种复杂操作任务中表现出色，并计划开源部分数据集以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基础模型在胎儿超声成像中的应用，发现领域特定的预训练能有效提高模型在低变异性的解剖结构识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管近期视觉基础模型在医学领域表现出色，但在解剖结构相似的情况下，它们的判别能力尚未系统研究。

Method: 将所有公开的胎儿超声数据集整理成统一的多中心基准，使用DINOv3进行自监督预训练，并通过多个适应协议评估学习到的特征。

Result: 在胎儿超声数据集上预训练的模型表现一致优于基于自然图像初始化的模型，加权F1分数提高了多达20%。

Conclusion: 通用基础模型在低类别间变异性下无法有效泛化，而领域特定的预训练对实现可靠的胎儿脑超声成像表示至关重要。

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了GFMs与传统模型在洪水映射中的表现，发现GFMs在准确性上有所提升，同时具有更快的计算速度和更少的标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GFMs显示出潜力，但尚不清楚其在与传统模型如U-Net的比较中的表现，缺乏系统的比较以指导最终用户选择模型。

Method: 系统地比较了三种GFMs（Clay、Prithvi、DOFA）与传统模型（U-Net、TransNorm、Attention U-Net），通过不同传感器（PlanetScope、Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2）进行评估。

Result: Clay在PlanetScope和Sentinel-2上的表现优于其他模型，而Prithvi在Sentinel-1的表现最佳。在所有地区的交叉验证中，Clay表现稍好，并在几次实验中显示出较小的模型规模和更快的计算速度。

Conclusion: 地理基础模型（GFMs）在洪水淹没映射中提供了小到中等的准确性提升，同时降低了计算成本和标注工作量，表明其作为传统U-Net的替代方案具有潜力。

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种基于固定采样模式的图像重建方法，使得在不完整测量条件下仍能达到优越的重建效果，并减少对真实数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一种新的方法，使用固定的采样模式来解决传统自监督方法中的不完整覆盖问题，以提高图像重建性能。

Method: 在学习基础框架中，采用固定的确定性采样模式来处理不完整的测量问题，包括上采样和填充。

Result: 我们的实验表明，这种方法可实现与完全监督方法相同的重建性能，且需要的地面真实数据显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法在光学分辨率图像上采样和光声显微镜（PAM）中显示出竞争力或更优的结果，同时所需的真实数据显著减少。

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种大型多模态模型在医学影像中检测受保护健康信息的效果，发现LMM有更好的OCR性能，但整体PHI检测准确性提高不明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着医疗信息隐私保护的重要性增加，探索更有效的PHI检测技术具有重要意义。

Method: 基于三种闭源和开源LMM的系统性基准测试，采用两种不同的管道配置进行分析。

Result: LMM在OCR效果上优于传统模型，但在PHI检测的一致性上表现不佳，尤其在文本区域清晰可读的情况下，管道配置影响有限。

Conclusion: LMM在医学影像中检测受保护健康信息方面显示了更好的OCR性能，但未必提升整体的PHI检测准确性。

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究介绍了StrengthSense开放数据集，包含IMU信号和力量相关活动的详细信息，旨在促进人类活动识别和健康监测的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏综合数据集来捕捉力量需求活动，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 数据通过对29名健康受试者进行实验收集，使用10个IMU传感器，并通过视频记录进行标注和验证。

Result: 数据集包含11种力量需求活动的IMU信号，允许研究人员和开发者进行活动识别和健康监测应用的研究。

Conclusion: StrengthSense数据集为力量相关活动的监测提供了宝贵资源，促进了人类活动识别算法的发展和健康监测应用的创建。

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自动化的文本视觉问答数据集合成流程，首次实现了基于场景文本的大规模QA对生产，显示了高效性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉问答任务中大规模数据库创建依赖人工标注，效率低且具有挑战性，因此需要一个能够自动化生成QA对的解决方案。

Method: 该方法结合了多种模型和算法，包括OCR检测和识别、区域兴趣检测、标题生成以及问题生成，形成一个流畅的自动化管道。

Result: 成功构建了一个包含约72K个QA对和约44K张图像的大规模文本-VQA数据集，为此类任务的研究提供了新的数据支持。

Conclusion: 提出的自动合成和验证文本视觉问答数据集的流程是首个能够大规模生成QA对的系统，展示了高效的合成能力和扩展性。

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种深度独立的AR注册系统，实现在手术中对小型解剖结构进行高精度追踪，结果显示系统具有良好的临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种高精度的无标记增强现实系统，以在真实手术环境中实现精确的解剖结构注册，特别是在处理小型或曲率较低的解剖结构时。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上，采用深度偏差校正、人机协作初始化、全局和局部注册方法，校准AHAT深度与CT导出的皮肤网模型。

Result: 预临床验证与CT测量结果显示AR跟踪距离与CT距离高度一致，临床试验中各解剖部位的中位误差分别为3.2 mm（脚）、4.3 mm（耳）、5.3 mm（小腿），表明该方法在活体手术中具有良好的适应性。

Conclusion: 一款深度独立无标记的增强现实（AR）注册系统在活体手术中实现了约3-4 mm的中位误差，适用于小型或低曲率目标，提升了无标记AR指导的临床准备度。

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的全自动管道用于有孔虫生长分析，结合了实例分割与腔室排序算法，显著提高了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高对有孔虫腔室生长过程的理解，并克服现有手动分割方法的局限。

Method: 结合实例分割技术和专门的腔室排序算法，从高分辨率CT扫描图像中自动重建三维生长轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方案显著减少了人工工作量，并且在生物学上仍保持有意义的准确性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的新方法能够实现全自动的检测和重建有孔虫的生长轨迹，为生态研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [10] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新型框架，结合PCA与RPCA，提高了路面裂缝宽度的测量精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化路面裂缝宽度对于评估结构完整性和指导维护干预至关重要，但传统方法在复杂裂缝边界上的效能有限，且需要快速测量能力以全面评估路面状况。

Method: 一个集成主成分分析（PCA）和稳健主成分分析（RPCA）的级联框架，通过三个阶段实现裂缝宽度提取：初始裂缝分割、主要方向轴确定和主传播轴提取。

Result: 对三组公开数据集进行了综合评估，证明该方法在计算效率和测量精度上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和测量精度上都优于现有的最先进技术。

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

Motivation: 解决GVQA任务中的复杂推理和视觉定位问题，提高多模态模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用三阶段管道处理GVQA任务，包括视频推理与问答、时空定位和跟踪。

Result: 在GVQA任务中取得HOTA分数0.4968，显著高于前一年获胜的0.2704分。

Conclusion: 该框架在GVQA任务中通过引入触发时刻显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Conclusion: MM-UNet在视网膜血管分割中表现出优越的性能，F1-score较现有方法有显著提升，证明了其有效性和先进性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种语言增强的生成模型，成功合成了逼真的PET图像，并在阿尔茨海默病诊断中优于传统模型，展示了该方法的临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于当前阿尔茨海默病诊断依赖昂贵且可及性有限的Abeta-PET，本研究探讨能否通过血液生物标志物和MRI扫描预测PET空间模式。

Method: 研究收集了566名参与者的Abeta-PET图像、T1加权MRI扫描和血液生物标志物，开发了一种大语言模型驱动的多模态信息融合生成模型。

Result: 合成的PET图像在结构细节和区域模式上与真实的PET扫描相似，诊断结果与基于真实PET的诊断一致性高，准确率达到80%。

Conclusion: 本研究通过语言增强的生成模型合成了真实的PET图像，提高了MRI和血液生物标志物在阿尔茨海默病的诊断中的应用，改善了诊断工作流程。

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's

Motivation: 需要更高效、更精确的方法来进行非破坏性的植物表型选择，克服传统植物表型方法的局限性。

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前左心室应变估算技术需大量人工干预，缺乏高效性和资源利用率，激励开发自动化方案。

Method: 研究采用深度学习方法建立了两个模型（TeeFlow和TeeTracker）来进行转食管超声心动图中SLS的自动估算。

Result: TeeTracker模型在运动估算准确度上优于TeeFlow，且在临床验证中，与临床参考相一致，证明自动化流程的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习技术的自动化管道自动化估算左心室的分段纵向应变能够显著提高心脏功能评估的精度和效率。

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基础模型在移动稀疏传感系统中能够显著提高性能，同时也揭示了其潜在的挑战。

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果显示与现有融合策略相比，所提方法在诊断性能上显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的协作注意力和一致性引导融合框架能够有效提升阿尔茨海默病的诊断性能。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Method: 通过分层任务分解的方法，将挑战分为低、中、高三个层次，采用前门干预模块减少混淆因素。

Result: HTSC-CIF显著提高了医疗报告生成的有效性，经过大量实验验证。

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF框架有效解决了医疗报告生成中的三个主要挑战，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Method: 探索将Euler角作为正则化流模型的基础，进行姿态估计。

Result: 研究表明，基于Euler角的模型在多个方面可能提供实用的解决方案。

Conclusion: Euler角参数化在姿态估计中具有潜在的实用性，尽管存在一些缺陷。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Result: SAIL-RL 在 4B 和 8B 规模下提高了推理和多模态理解的基准性能，并与商业封闭源模型如 GPT-4o 竞争。

Conclusion: SAIL-RL 是一个有效的后期训练框架，可以显著提高多模态大型语言模型的推理能力和适应性，减少幻觉现象。

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Motivation: 旨在提供一个高效、鲁棒的框架来进行相机位姿的准确估计，避免了传统方法的束调整需求。

Result: Cycle-Sync在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，性能持续优于领先的位姿估计算法。

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync在相机位姿估计中表现优于现有方法，尤其是在回旋一致性和鲁棒性的提升上。

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Motivation: 解决现有后处理OOD检测方法未考虑特征与logits之间内在关联性的问题，从而提升OOD检测的有效性。

Method: 提出Global-Aware Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration（GAFD-CC），通过全局分类权重指导的特征解耦和多尺度logit基础置信度融合，实现OOD检测。

Result: GAFD-CC提取了正相关与负相关特征，增强了决策边界的清晰度，有效减少假阳性，提高检测的准确性。

Conclusion: GAFD-CC在OOD检测中通过全局特征解耦和置信度校准，提高了决策边界和判别性能，并展示了与其他先进方法相较之下的竞争力与泛化能力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 为了弥补当代视觉-语言模型在推理能力上的不足，以应对丰富的视觉感知和语言表达。

Method: 提出了一种新的框架CoCoVa，采用迭代推理循环和动态推理引擎LQ-Former，结合对比学习和扩散重建的多任务目标。

Result: 实验表明CoCoVa在多项基准测试中超越或与更大模型竞争，且学习到的潜在空间展现可解释和结构化的推理模式。

Conclusion: CoCoVa通过连续的跨模态推理增强视觉-语言模型，提升了准确性和效能，展现出其在视觉理解和语言处理之间的潜力。

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Motivation: 尽管猫和人类的眼部解剖存在显著差异，但这些特征如何在视觉表征中体现仍未完全理解，因此本研究旨在探讨并量化这种跨物种的视觉表征对齐。

Method: 使用层级中心核对齐和表征相似性分析的统一标准，对猫和人类在视觉表征上的跨物种对齐进行定量评估，并进行了附加的分布性和稳定性测试。

Result: DINO ViT-B/16在模型间取得了最显著的对齐表现，尤其是在早期块，表明自监督可能在跨物种视觉统计上体现了早期特征之间的桥梁。

Conclusion: 自监督结合ViT的归纳偏差能够更好地对齐猫科动物和人类的视觉系统，而CNN和窗状Transformer的表现则相对较差。这些结果提供了可以被进一步验证的神经科学假说，探讨跨物种视觉计算的交汇点和方式。

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

Conclusion: IllumFlow在低光照图像增强和曝光校正方面表现出了优越的定量和定性性能。

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,
on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the
potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on
challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained

Conclusion: KAO框架为高分辨率卫星图像修复设置了新的基准，提供了一种可扩展的高性能解决方案，平衡了预处理模型的效率和后处理模型的灵活性。

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

Motivation: 解决现有方法只能处理从整段视频中识别单一动作的问题，适应新兴的时空动作识别 (STAR) 任务。

Method: 提出了一种基于 transformer 的视角间合作模块，以特征图而非嵌入向量进行有效的合作，保留空间信息，并将自注意力划分为同视角和异视角的处理。

Result: 通过实验证明， MVAFormer 在新的数据集上，比对比基线提高了约 4.4 个点的 F-measure。

Conclusion: MVAFormer 在 STAR 设置下的多视角动作识别中表现优异，超越了基准算法。

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Conclusion: OLATverse是一个大规模数据集，旨在促进逆向渲染和重新照明方法的现实世界应用。

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

Method: 通过PtychoBench这一新多模态、多任务基准进行系统比较，评估监督微调（SFT）和上下文学习（ICL）策略。

Result: 在视觉任务中，SFT和ICL高度互补，微调模型在上下文示例引导下达到最高平均性能；对文本任务而言，ICL在大基模型上表现优越。

Conclusion: 最佳专业化路径依赖于任务的模态，为开发更高效的科学基础系统提供了明确的框架。

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Conclusion: UniChange是首个基于多模态大语言模型的统一变化检测模型，能够有效整合不同类别的变化检测数据，展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated

TL;DR: LiteVoxel是一个自适应训练管道，优化稀疏体素光栅化，显著降低内存占用，保持低频细节，提高训练效率和模型稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏体素光栅化在场景重建中存在低频内容拟合不足和内存使用不稳定的问题，因此需要一个更稳健且轻量的训练方法。

Method: 介绍LiteVoxel自适应训练管道，使用反Sobel重加权和深度分位数阈值修剪来优化稀疏体素光栅化过程。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks & Temples数据集上，LiteVoxel在减少低频区域错误和边界不稳定的同时，保持了与强SVRaster管道相当的PSNR/SSIM、训练时间和FPS。

Conclusion: LiteVoxel通过自适应调整和优化策略显著降低了内存需求，并提高了低频细节的保持，从而实现了更高效的训练和更稳定的模型性能。

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码作为推理和行动的媒介，视觉中心的编码尚未得到充分探索，因此需要改进这一领域的理解和生成能力。

Method: 基于VCode基准，提出了一种新颖的评估协议CodeVQA，以检验生成的SVG的符号保留能力。

Result: VCoder在多个基准测试中表现出比当前最优秀模型提升了12.3个百分点，尤其在专业知识和三维推理方面仍有待提高。

Conclusion: 提出了一个名为VCoder的框架，通过引入修订思维和视觉工具来改进当前视觉语言模型，显著提高了SVG生成的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

TL;DR: 本研究发布了UVH-26数据集，包含26646张印度交通摄像头图像，采用众包方式注释，支持智能交通系统的研究和应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建一个专门针对印度交通场景的大规模标注交通摄像头图像数据集，以支持交通检测模型的训练和提升。

Method: 通过众包黑客马拉松对来自2800个班加罗尔安全城市监控摄像头的26646张高分辨率交通图像进行注释，使用多数投票和STAPLE算法生成286k-316k个共识真实边界框和标签。

Result: 使用UVH-26训练的模型在mAP50:95上比基线模型提高了8.4%-31.5%。

Conclusion: UVH-26数据集填补了现有全球基准中的关键空白，并为在复杂交通条件下的新兴国家推动智能交通系统的检测、分类和部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

*Md Rashidunnabi,Kailash A. Hambarde,Vasco Lopes,Joao C. Neves,Hugo Proenca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为MTF-CVReID的高效框架，包含七个模块，针对跨视角人重识别在鲁棒性和时间一致性上提供了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础的人重识别在跨视角领域（如航空-地面监控）面临极大挑战，包括视点变化、尺度差异和时间不一致性，因此需要一种有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个名为MTF-CVReID的框架，在ViT-B/16主干基础上，设计了七个互补模块以解决跨视图领域的挑战。

Result: MTF-CVReID比基线增加约200万参数和0.7 GFLOPs，却能实现189 FPS的实时效率，并在AG-VPReID基准测试中在各个高度水平上取得了最好成绩，同时对G2A-VReID和MARS数据集展现了强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: MTF-CVReID通过引入七个互补模块，显著提高了跨视角人重识别的鲁棒性和时间一致性，同时保持了计算效率，取得了AG-VPReID基准测试的领先表现。

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

*Jingyu Lu,Haonan Wang,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VCFlow，一个新型的脑部视觉重建框架，优化了跨主体解码，提升了速度与效能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对主观无关的脑部解码挑战，探索一种无需特定主体训练的跨主体视觉重建方法。

Method: 提出了一种层次解码框架VCFlow，利用人类视觉系统的腹侧-背侧架构。通过对早期视觉皮层、腹侧和背侧通路的特征进行解耦和利用，VCFlow捕捉多维的认知信息。并引入特征级对比学习策略，增强对主体不变语义表示的提取。

Result: VCFlow在只损失7%准确率的情况下，能够在10秒内生成每个重建视频，且无需重训练，相较于传统方法大大减少了对每个主体数据和计算的需求。

Conclusion: VCFlow提供了一种快速且可临床扩展的视觉重建解决方案，显著提高了跨主体的适用性和效率。

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

TL;DR: TAUE模型通过无训练方法实现了多层次且一致的图像生成，提供了新的生成工作流程的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在生成单一扁平图像时的局限性，以满足专业应用对分层控制的需求。

Method: 介绍了一种名为噪声移植与培养(NTC)的核心技术，能够在初始噪声中提取并移植各层次的中间潜在表达，确保语义和结构的一致性。

Result: 实验结果显示，TAUE模型的性能与经过微调的方法相当，同时提升了分层一致性，保持了高图像质量和保真度。

Conclusion: TAUE模型能够在训练无需求的情况下，实现高质量的分层图像生成，并推动复杂合成编辑等新型应用的发展。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Conclusion: 本文提出的跟踪框架在多个不同物种和环境中表现出色且一致，验证了其在新的数据集上无需重新训练的潜力。

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LMM在推理过程中的效率低下，尤其是由图像编码器引入的大量视觉token造成的问题。

Method: 通过标准化协议评估六个能力维度和十个数据集，涵盖十种代表性压缩算法和三类多模态LMM。

Result: 研究发现随机剪枝是一个强基线，没有单一方法在各种场景下表现一致，剪枝敏感性在任务之间差异显著，剪枝比例是影响性能退化的主要因素。

Conclusion: UniPruneBench将为未来关于高效多模态建模的研究提供可靠基础。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and

Method: 使用中间生成的图像作为可见与红外模态间的传输者，通过模态转换对比损失和模态查询正则化损失进行训练。

Result: 在三个典型VI-ReID数据集上，我们的方法在性能上显著超越现有SOTA。

Conclusion: 我们提出的Modality-Transition Representation Learning框架在VI-ReID任务上显著超越了现有的最先进方法，且无需额外参数。

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种新颖的情感线索引导推理框架，并通过VidEmo模型实现视频情感理解的重大进展，设置了15个面部感知任务的新里程碑。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: 本研究首次全面探讨了视频-文本表示对齐，揭示了视觉和文本数据的丰富性对跨模态对齐的显著影响，并提出了相关的参数化测试时间缩放规律。

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Motivation: 应对单图像3D重建和编辑中的显著遮挡、感知监督不足和3D空间编辑的歧义性。

Method: 采用双分支编码器和ViT解码器，通过迭代交叉注意力将2D特征提升到3D空间，渲染使用高斯点云。

Conclusion: PercHead是一个用于单图像3D头部重建和语义3D编辑的先进方法，具备良好的鲁棒性和用户友好的交互功能。

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

TL;DR: MIRA基准评估模型在生成和利用中间视觉信息进行推理的能力，结果显示中间视觉线索显著提升了模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过创建MIRA基准，旨在评估模型在需要生成和利用中间视觉图像的场景中的推理能力，以更好地模拟人类的思维过程。

Method: 提出一种统一的评估协议，包含三种输入级别，并对546个多模态问题进行评估，记录不同k设置下的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，现有多模态大型语言模型在仅使用文本提示时性能较差，但在提供中间视觉线索后，所有模型和任务的平均相对提升为33.7%。

Conclusion: MIRA基准强调了中间视觉信息在有效推理中的重要性，且现有多模态大型语言模型在仅依赖文本提示时表现不佳，但在提供中间视觉线索后性能显著提升。

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

### [56] [IG-Pruning: Input-Guided Block Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02213)
*Kangyu Qiao,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IG-Pruning是一种新型动态剪枝方法，通过输入感知优化语言模型的推理效率，对比传统方法表现更佳，适用于资源限制条件下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型计算需求的增加，实现高效推理对于实际部署变得更为关键。

Method: 本研究提出了一种两阶段的方法：首先通过语义聚类和L0优化发现多样化的掩码候选，随后实现高效的动态剪枝，无需广泛的训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，IG-Pruning在性能上持续优于最先进的静态深度剪枝方法，尤其适用于资源受限的部署场景。

Conclusion: IG-Pruning是一种新颖的输入感知块级剪枝方法，能够在推理时动态选择层掩码，显著优于现有静态深度剪枝方法。

Abstract: With the growing computational demands of large language models (LLMs),
efficient inference has become increasingly critical for practical deployment.
Depth pruning has emerged as a promising approach for reducing the
computational costs of large language models by removing transformer layers.
However, existing methods typically rely on fixed block masks, which can lead
to suboptimal performance across different tasks and inputs. In this paper, we
propose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that
dynamically selects layer masks at inference time. Our approach consists of two
stages: (1) Discovering diverse mask candidates through semantic clustering and
L0 optimization, and (2) Implementing efficient dynamic pruning without the
need for extensive training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static depth pruning methods, making
it particularly suitable for resource-constrained deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨医学聊天机器人在评估过程中的表现，强调多 LLM 评估的重要性，并发现 LLM 之间的一致性较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解医学聊天机器人在不同人口统计信息存在时失败的条件，以确保它们在医疗背景下提供一致的建议。

Method: 我们开发了一个基础设施，自动生成查询以探查 LLM，并利用多种 LLM 作为评估者的设置和提示对答案进行评估。

Result: 我们的研究发现 LLM 注释者之间的协议评分较低，仅有特定的（回答、评估） LLM配对在不同的写作风格、性别和种族上表现出统计显著差异。

Conclusion: 在医学聊天机器人的评估中，我们强调使用多种 LLM 作为评估者的重要性，以避免非一般化的统计显著结果，并建议发布 LLM 之间的协议度指标以提高透明度。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that hallucinations, omissions, and biases are
prevalent in everyday use-cases of LLMs. However, chatbots used in medical
contexts must provide consistent advice in situations where non-medical factors
are involved, such as when demographic information is present. In order to
understand the conditions under which medical chatbots fail to perform as
expected, we develop an infrastructure that 1) automatically generates queries
to probe LLMs and 2) evaluates answers to these queries using multiple
LLM-as-a-judge setups and prompts. For 1), our prompt creation pipeline samples
the space of patient demographics, histories, disorders, and writing styles to
create realistic questions that we subsequently use to prompt LLMs. In 2), our
evaluation pipeline provides hallucination and omission detection using
LLM-as-a-judge as well as agentic workflows, in addition to LLM-as-a-judge
treatment category detectors. As a baseline study, we perform two case studies
on inter-LLM agreement and the impact of varying the answering and evaluation
LLMs. We find that LLM annotators exhibit low agreement scores (average Cohen's
Kappa $\kappa=0.118$), and only specific (answering, evaluation) LLM pairs
yield statistically significant differences across writing styles, genders, and
races. We recommend that studies using LLM evaluation use multiple LLMs as
evaluators in order to avoid arriving at statistically significant but
non-generalizable results, particularly in the absence of ground-truth data. We
also suggest publishing inter-LLM agreement metrics for transparency. Our code
and dataset are available here:

### [58] [Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358)
*Wongyu Kim,Hochang Lee,Sanghak Lee,Yoonsung Kim,Jaehyun Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M-Solomon是一种通用的多模态嵌入器，通过适应性查询增强在性能和嵌入延迟上超过了基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的方法在查询增强过程中存在嵌入延迟过高和性能下降的问题，且未在多模态环境中进行探索。

Method: 通过将训练数据集的查询分为需要增强和不需要增强的两个组，并采用强大的多模态大型语言模型生成适当的增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，M-Solomon在大型语言模型基础上进行了有效的查询增强，同时大幅降低了嵌入延迟。

Conclusion: M-Solomon在查询增强的效果和嵌入延迟方面表现优异，适应性地确定何时进行查询增强。

Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further
information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have
proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation
for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by
leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly
trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding,
showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial
embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for
some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal
environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal
multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our
approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at
the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other
includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that
generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging
a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.
Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary
by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for
queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.
Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline
without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that
always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.

*Liuhao Lin,Ke Li,Zihan Xu,Yuchen Shi,Yulei Qin,Yan Zhang,Xing Sun,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTD-Bench是一种新的评估基准，能直观显示大型语言模型在空间推理方面的缺陷，并通过视觉输出促进更全面的模型分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的评价方法依赖不透明的数值指标，无法直观地理解模型的能力，特别是在物理世界理解方面存在显著的局限性。

Method: 通过需要模型生成绘图的任务，将评估从抽象的分数转变为可直接观察的视觉输出。

Result: LTD-Bench的实验表明，即使在传统基准上表现优异的模型，在语言与空间概念的双向映射上依然存在严重缺陷。

Conclusion: LTD-Bench显著改善了对大型语言模型空间推理能力的评估，暴露了其在语言与空间概念映射方面的缺陷，从而为AI研究提供了重要的诊断工具。

Abstract: Current evaluation paradigms for large language models (LLMs) represent a
critical blind spot in AI research--relying on opaque numerical metrics that
conceal fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning while providing no
intuitive understanding of model capabilities. This deficiency creates a
dangerous disconnect between reported performance and practical abilities,
particularly for applications requiring physical world understanding. We
introduce LTD-Bench, a breakthrough benchmark that transforms LLM evaluation
from abstract scores to directly observable visual outputs by requiring models
to generate drawings through dot matrices or executable code. This approach
makes spatial reasoning limitations immediately apparent even to non-experts,
bridging the fundamental gap between statistical performance and intuitive
assessment. LTD-Bench implements a comprehensive methodology with complementary
generation tasks (testing spatial imagination) and recognition tasks (assessing
spatial perception) across three progressively challenging difficulty levels,
methodically evaluating both directions of the critical language-spatial
mapping. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models expose an
alarming capability gap: even LLMs achieving impressive results on traditional
benchmarks demonstrate profound deficiencies in establishing bidirectional
mappings between language and spatial concept--a fundamental limitation that
undermines their potential as genuine world models. Furthermore, LTD-Bench's
visual outputs enable powerful diagnostic analysis, offering a potential
approach to investigate model similarity.

Motivation: 应对中文应用场景中特有的安全挑战，确保大型语言模型在法律和伦理方面的合规性。

Method: 通过对18个大型语言模型进行评估，建立了一个公共可访问的领导者榜单，以反映AI在中文语境下的安全性。

Result: 推出了LiveSecBench，结合动态更新机制，计划未来将新增对文本生成和自主安全的评估。

Conclusion: LiveSecBench提供了一个动态更新的安全基准，专注于中文语言大型语言模型的应用场景，涵盖法律、伦理和安全等多个维度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose LiveSecBench, a dynamic and continuously updated
safety benchmark specifically for Chinese-language LLM application scenarios.
LiveSecBench evaluates models across six critical dimensions (Legality, Ethics,
Factuality, Privacy, Adversarial Robustness, and Reasoning Safety) rooted in
the Chinese legal and social frameworks. This benchmark maintains relevance
through a dynamic update schedule that incorporates new threat vectors, such as
the planned inclusion of Text-to-Image Generation Safety and Agentic Safety in
the next update. For now, LiveSecBench (v251030) has evaluated 18 LLMs,
providing a landscape of AI safety in the context of Chinese language. The

TL;DR: AyurParam-2.9B 是一个专业的双语语言模型，经过针对 Ayurveda 领域的微调，展现了在专门医学知识领域的优异表现和适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在广泛任务中表现出色，但在需要深厚文化、语言和专业知识的专门领域表现不佳，特别是在传统医学系统如 Ayurveda 中。

Method: 利用一个庞大且经过专家精心策划的 Ayurveda 数据集，对 Param-1-2.9B 进行微调，创建了一个双语、专业化的语言模型。

Result: AyurParam-2.9B 在 BhashaBench-Ayur 上的评估结果表明，其在同类模型中表现优越，并且与更大模型相较具有竞争力或优越的表现。

Conclusion: AyurParam-2.9B 显示了在专门医学知识领域进行真实领域适应和高质量监督的必要性，以提供可靠且符合文化的人工智能。

Abstract: Current large language models excel at broad, general-purpose tasks, but
consistently underperform when exposed to highly specialized domains that
require deep cultural, linguistic, and subject-matter expertise. In particular,
traditional medical systems such as Ayurveda embody centuries of nuanced
textual and clinical knowledge that mainstream LLMs fail to accurately
interpret or apply. We introduce AyurParam-2.9B, a domain-specialized,
bilingual language model fine-tuned from Param-1-2.9B using an extensive,
expertly curated Ayurveda dataset spanning classical texts and clinical
guidance. AyurParam's dataset incorporates context-aware, reasoning, and
objective-style Q&A in both English and Hindi, with rigorous annotation
protocols for factual precision and instructional clarity. Benchmarked on
BhashaBench-Ayur, AyurParam not only surpasses all open-source
instruction-tuned models in its size class (1.5--3B parameters), but also
demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to much larger
models. The results from AyurParam highlight the necessity for authentic domain
adaptation and high-quality supervision in delivering reliable, culturally
congruent AI for specialized medical knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoAdv是一个新框架，针对多轮交互中大型语言模型的脆弱性，展示了单轮优化的防御机制在多轮环境中的不足，提出了迫切需要改进的方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在面对真实世界攻击时的脆弱性，尤其是多轮对话中的攻击与评估。

Method: 提出了一个无训练的自动化多轮破解框架AutoAdv，结合了三种自适应机制来增强攻击效果。

Result: AutoAdv在Llama-3.1-8B模型上达成了高达95%的攻击成功率，是单轮基线的24%提升，多轮攻击显著优于单轮方法。

Conclusion: 现有的安全机制在面对多轮对话时表现出持续的脆弱性，这表明单轮交互优化的对齐策略未能在扩展对话中保持稳健性，强调了迫切需要针对多轮对话的防御措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where
adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on
single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive
multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for
automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate
on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn
baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern
manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a
temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on
failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful
requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial
and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent
vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks
consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate
that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to
maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need
for multi-turn-aware defenses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 针对大型语言模型在专业领域表现不佳的问题，提出通过领域专家模型合并来提升金融LLM的表现，并评估了多种合并方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在一般任务中表现出色，但在金融等专业领域面临挑战，因此需要开发合适的模型合并方法。

Method: 三阶段评估方法包括知识恢复、互补性和涌现，评估了三种合并方法（Task Arithmetic，TIES和DARE-TIES）。

Result: 合并专家模型与基础模型能够恢复在CPT过程中丢失的通用知识，且专家模型的合并能够提升性能并产生跨领域技能。

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了CPT模型合并的基础分析，提供了建立多技能LLM的原则框架和明确指导。

Abstract: While LLMs excel at general tasks, they struggle in specialized domains like
finance, requiring diverse skills in domain knowledge, mathematical reasoning,
and multilingual processing. Merging domain-specific Continual Pre-training
(CPT) "experts" offers a practical alternative to costly and unstable
multi-skill training. However, unlike established Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
model-based merging, CPT model merging remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by creating financial LLMs from experts in finance, math, and
Japanese. We propose a three-stage evaluation focusing on knowledge recovery,
complementarity, and emergence, and assess three merging methods (Task
Arithmetic, TIES, and DARE-TIES) on a comprehensive financial benchmark curated
from 18 tasks across 8 established datasets. Results show that merging an
expert with its base model recovers general knowledge lost during CPT, while
merging experts improves performance and can yield emergent cross-domain
skills. Among the methods, Task Arithmetic performs strongly but is
hyperparameter-sensitive, whereas TIES is more robust. Our findings also
suggest that while model similarity correlates with merging success, emergent
skills depend on more complex factors. This work presents the first
foundational analysis of CPT model merging, establishing a principled framework
and providing clear guidance for building multi-skill LLMs from existing
assets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估基于人物的提示是否能改善大语言模型在宏观经济预测任务上的表现，尤其是与人类专家的比较。

Method: 使用PersonaHub数据集中2368个经济相关的人物，通过GPT-4o进行宏观经济预测，并与人类专家进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o与人类预测者的准确性水平相似，且在未见事件的外样本评估中仍维持竞争力。个性化提示未能带来明显的预测优势。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在宏观经济预测中与人类预测者的准确性相当，但个性化提示对提升预测精度没有显著效果，因此可以省略以降低计算成本。

Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model
(LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368
economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to
replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds
(2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human
experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth,
unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against
100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We
report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve
remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically
significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025
data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance
on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample
period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting
advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be
omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results
provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even
on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data,
while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts
compared to human panels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了提高教育中个性化学习的效果，重点关注学生知识建模的问题，尤其是传统模型忽视问题文本导致的预测性能下降。

Method: 提出了一种将知识追踪重新框定为下一个标记预测任务的方法，使用预训练的大型语言模型，结合学生的历史记录和问题内容作为文本序列。

Result: 实验结果显示，NTKT在性能上显著超越了最新的神经知识追踪模型，并且在冷启动情况下具有更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: NTKT通过利用预训练的大型语言模型显著提高了知识追踪的预测性能，特别是在冷启动问题和用户上表现更佳。

Abstract: Modelling student knowledge is a key challenge when leveraging AI in
education, with major implications for personalised learning. The Knowledge
Tracing (KT) task aims to predict how students will respond to educational
questions in learning environments, based on their prior interactions. Existing
KT models typically use response correctness along with metadata like skill
tags and timestamps, often overlooking the question text, which is an important
source of pedagogical insight. This omission poses a lost opportunity while
limiting predictive performance. We propose Next Token Knowledge Tracing
(NTKT), a novel approach that reframes KT as a next-token prediction task using
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). NTKT represents both student histories
and question content as sequences of text, allowing LLMs to learn patterns in
both behaviour and language. Our series of experiments significantly improves
performance over state-of-the-art neural KT models and generalises much better
to cold-start questions and users. These findings highlight the importance of
question content in KT and demonstrate the benefits of leveraging pretrained
representations of LLMs to model student learning more effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CGES是一种基于贝叶斯的框架，通过自适应停止模型调用来提高效率，同时保持接近自一致性的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 采用自一致性策略进行多次查询时，需要固定的调用次数，但在正确答案稀有的情况下可能失效。

Method: CGES采用贝叶斯框架，根据由标记概率或奖励模型推导出的标量置信信号形成候选答案的后验分布，并根据设定的阈值自适应停止取样。

Result: 在五个推理基准上，CGES将模型调用的平均次数减少了约69％，同时与自一致性保持在0.06个百分点的准确率内。

Conclusion: Confidence-Guided Early Stopping (CGES)提高了模型调用效率，同时保持了高准确率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often queried multiple times at test time,
with predictions aggregated by majority vote. While effective, this
self-consistency strategy (arXiv:2203.11171) requires a fixed number of calls
and can fail when the correct answer is rare. We introduce Confidence-Guided
Early Stopping (CGES), a Bayesian framework that forms posteriors over
candidate answers using scalar confidence signals derived from token
probabilities or reward models. CGES adaptively halts sampling once the
posterior mass of a candidate exceeds a threshold. We provide theoretical
guarantees for both perfectly calibrated confidences and realistic noisy
confidence signals. Across five reasoning benchmarks, CGES reduces the average
number of model calls by about 69 percent (for example, from 16.0 to 4.9) while
matching the accuracy of self-consistency within 0.06 percentage points.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新的框架，用于维护大型语言模型与人类价值观的对齐，解决了现有方法的不足，实现了有效的再对齐，而不损害模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类价值的对齐至关重要，但现有方法存在静态、脆弱且维护成本高的问题，无法跟上不断发展的规范和政策。

Method: 引入TRACE框架，通过针对新政策对现有偏好数据进行程序化分类，识别高影响力的冲突，并采用混合优化方法来处理偏好，同时保持模型性能。

Result: 在多种模型家族（如Qwen2.5-7B、Gemma-2-9B、Llama-3.1-8B）的实证结果中，TRACE在复杂政策转变下的PKU-SafeRLHF数据集上，实现了新的原则而不降低通用能力。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展、动态和具成本效益的框架，能够有效维护大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类价值观的对齐，为可持续和负责任的人工智能部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values is central to
their safe deployment, yet current practice produces static, brittle, and
costly-to-maintain models that fail to keep pace with evolving norms and
policies. This misalignment, which we term the Alignment-Reality Gap, poses a
growing challenge for reliable long-term use. Existing remedies are inadequate:
large-scale re-annotation is economically prohibitive, and standard unlearning
methods act as blunt instruments that erode utility rather than enable precise
policy updates. We introduce TRACE (Triage and Re-align by Alignment Conflict
Evaluation), a framework for principled unlearning that reconceives
re-alignment as a programmatic policy application problem. TRACE
programmatically triages existing preference data against a new policy,
identifies high-impact conflicts via a alignment impact score, and applies a
hybrid optimization that cleanly inverts, discards, or preserves preferences
while safeguarding model performance. Empirical results show that TRACE
achieves robust re-alignment across diverse model families (Qwen2.5-7B,
Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.1-8B). On both synthetic benchmarks and the PKU-SafeRLHF
dataset under complex policy shift, TRACE enforces new principles without
degrading general capabilities. Our work establishes a scalable, dynamic, and
cost-effective paradigm for maintaining LLM alignment, providing a foundation
for sustainable and responsible AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究未深入调查大语言模型在新知识微调时产生幻觉的具体表现和潜在机制，因此本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了一个受控数据集Biography-Reasoning，进行多种知识类型和任务类型的细致分析，探索LLMs在新知识微调时的幻觉现象及其机制。

Result: 研究发现，当LLMs在完全由新知识组成的数据集上进行微调时，会显著增加幻觉倾向，且新知识的特定类型的不熟悉度是强幻觉驱动因素，而KnownPatch方法有效缓解了这一现象。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的KnownPatch方法有效缓解了新知识引起的幻觉现象，并改善了模型在知识问答任务中的表现。

Abstract: Previous studies show that introducing new knowledge during large language
models (LLMs) fine-tuning can lead to the generation of erroneous output when
tested on known information, thereby triggering factual hallucinations.
However, existing studies have not deeply investigated the specific
manifestations and underlying mechanisms of these hallucinations. Our work
addresses this gap by designing a controlled dataset Biography-Reasoning, and
conducting a fine-grained analysis across multiple knowledge types and two task
types, including knowledge question answering (QA) and knowledge reasoning
tasks. We find that when fine-tuned on a dataset in which a specific knowledge
type consists entirely of new knowledge, LLMs exhibit significantly increased
hallucination tendencies. This suggests that the high unfamiliarity of a
particular knowledge type, rather than the overall proportion of new knowledge,
is a stronger driver of hallucinations, and these tendencies can even affect
other knowledge types in QA tasks. To mitigate such factual hallucinations, we
propose KnownPatch, which patches a small number of known knowledge samples in
the later stages of training, effectively alleviating new-knowledge-induced
hallucinations. Through attention analysis, we find that learning new knowledge
reduces the model's attention to key entities in the question, thus causing
excessive focus on the surrounding context, which may increase the risk of
hallucination. Moreover, the attention pattern can propagate to similar
contexts, facilitating the spread of hallucinations to textually similar
questions. Our method effectively mitigates the disruption of new knowledge
learning to the model's attention on key entities, accompanied by improved
performance.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在存储效率和准确性上优于单独使用低秩近似或稀疏化，且在相同内存预算下表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly prevalent across diverse
applications. However, their enormous size limits storage and processing
capabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most
applications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,
even storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant
challenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show
that fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,
highlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This
paper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models
after fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that
fine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for
storage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or
sparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model
expressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified
low-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank
approximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,
optimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated
updates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring
that the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage
efficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to
employing the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually.

Motivation: 由于翻译者常常为新受众丰富文本，隐性文化意义往往需要明确，这促使研究者探讨如何计算建模这一现象。

Method: 通过处理TED-Multi和Europarl的多语言语料库，识别候选的隐含说明案例，并结合人类注释进行主动学习细化。

Result: 在语言对之间，实体和系统级的说明最为频繁，主动学习提高了分类器的准确性7-8个百分点，达到了0.88的准确率和0.82的F1值。

Conclusion: PragExTra建立了一个可度量的跨语言现象，实质上推动了对文化敏感的机器翻译的研究。

Abstract: Translators often enrich texts with background details that make implicit
cultural meanings explicit for new audiences. This phenomenon, known as
pragmatic explicitation, has been widely discussed in translation theory but
rarely modeled computationally. We introduce PragExTra, the first multilingual
corpus and detection framework for pragmatic explicitation. The corpus covers
eight language pairs from TED-Multi and Europarl and includes additions such as
entity descriptions, measurement conversions, and translator remarks. We
identify candidate explicitation cases through null alignments and refined
using active learning with human annotation. Our results show that entity and
system-level explicitations are most frequent, and that active learning
improves classifier accuracy by 7-8 percentage points, achieving up to 0.88
accuracy and 0.82 F1 across languages. PragExTra establishes pragmatic
explicitation as a measurable, cross-linguistic phenomenon and takes a step
towards building culturally aware machine translation. Keywords: translation,
multilingualism, explicitation

Motivation: 随着人工智能的全球传播速度加快，采用程度却不均衡，尤其在低资源语言国家表现不佳。

Method: 运用加权回归模型，将语言效应与社会经济和人口因素分离，以进行测试。

Result: 发现低资源语言国家的AI用户比例约比基线低20%。

Conclusion: 语言可及性是AI传播的一个重要独立障碍，影响低资源语言国家的用户比例。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is diffusing globally at unprecedented speed,
but adoption remains uneven. Frontier Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to
perform poorly on low-resource languages due to data scarcity. We hypothesize
that this performance deficit reduces the utility of AI, thereby slowing
adoption in Low-Resource Language Countries (LRLCs). To test this, we use a
weighted regression model to isolate the language effect from socioeconomic and
demographic factors, finding that LRLCs have a share of AI users that is
approximately 20% lower relative to their baseline. These results indicate that
linguistic accessibility is a significant, independent barrier to equitable AI
diffusion.

Conclusion: CoRL框架在不同预算条件下优化了多智能体LLM系统的性能与成本权衡，证明了集中协调的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains
and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM
systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for
every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In
this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller
LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and
cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as
reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while
minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent
system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during
inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework
that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget
setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a
single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while
maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes,
highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and
cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.

Motivation: 对现有文本检索模型的局限性进行量化，尤其是在目标文档嵌入之间距离增大时表现出更大困难。

Method: AMER模型通过自回归方式生成多个查询向量，利用这些向量从语料库中检索文档。

Result: 在合成矢量化数据上，AMER方法在捕捉多目标分布方面表现出色，相比单嵌入模型提高了4倍的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的AMER模型在多查询向量检索中显示出卓越的性能，尤其是在目标文档相互差异较大的情况下。

Abstract: Most text retrievers generate \emph{one} query vector to retrieve relevant
documents. Yet, the conditional distribution of relevant documents for the
query may be multimodal, e.g., representing different interpretations of the
query. We first quantify the limitations of existing retrievers. All retrievers
we evaluate struggle more as the distance between target document embeddings
grows. To address this limitation, we develop a new retriever architecture,
\emph{A}utoregressive \emph{M}ulti-\emph{E}mbedding \emph{R}etriever (AMER).
Our model autoregressively generates multiple query vectors, and all the
predicted query vectors are used to retrieve documents from the corpus. We show
that on the synthetic vectorized data, the proposed method could capture
multiple target distributions perfectly, showing 4x better performance than
single embedding model. We also fine-tune our model on real-world multi-answer
retrieval datasets and evaluate in-domain. AMER presents 4 and 21\% relative
gains over single-embedding baselines on two datasets we evaluate on.
Furthermore, we consistently observe larger gains on the subset of dataset
where the embeddings of the target documents are less similar to each other. We
demonstrate the potential of using a multi-query vector retriever and open up a
new direction for future work.

TL;DR: 本研究引入Oolong，作为长上下文推理任务的新基准，揭示现有模型在处理此类任务时的局限性，且准确率普遍低于50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型上下文长度的增长，评估模型有效使用整个上下文的能力变得愈发重要，因此我们设计了Oolong这一新基准。

Method: 通过引入Oolong基准，进行长上下文推理任务的评估，重点分析文本的各个部分，并要求模型聚合分析结果以回答分布性问题。

Result: 在128K条件下，GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4和Gemini-2.5-Pro等前沿模型在Oolong上的准确率均低于50%。

Conclusion: Oolong基准测试显示，前沿模型在处理长上下文推理任务时表现不佳，揭示了现有模型在有效利用长上下文方面的局限性。

Abstract: As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models
effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully
designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these
evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context,
which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This
represents only one type of task that might be performed with long context. We
introduce Oolong, a benchmark of long-context reasoning tasks that require
analyzing individual chunks of text on an atomic level, and then aggregating
these analyses to answer distributional questions. Oolong is separated into two
task sets: Oolong-synth, a set of naturalistic synthetic tasks, where we can
easily ablate components of the reasoning problem; and Oolong-real, a
downstream setting which requires reasoning over real-world conversational
data. Oolong requires models to reason over large quantities of examples, to
perform both classification and counting in-context, and to reason over
temporal and user relations. Even frontier models struggle on Oolong, with
GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Gemini-2.5-Pro all achieving less than 50% accuracy
on both splits at 128K. We release the data and evaluation harness for Oolong
to enable further development of models that can reason over large quantities
of text.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and

Conclusion: SoCo框架显著提高了多智能体强化学习的训练效率和性能，展示了单独演示数据在合作学习中的重要价值。

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Result: FineXL能提供每个个性化方面的自然语言描述及其级别的定量评分，实验结果表明其在多种个性化场景下显著提升了可解释性的准确性。

Conclusion: FineXL显著提高了个性化图像生成模型的可解释性，准确度提升了56%。

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical

However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising

Conclusion: Neural Green's Function在复杂几何体的线性偏微分方程求解中表现优异，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires

Conclusion: DeepContour 提供了一种高效而稳健的方法来解决大规模广义特征值问题，通过深度学习与经典求解器的结合，显著加速了解决过程。

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

TL;DR: 通过适度增加简单问题的训练，模型能够在不增加输出长度的情况下提高解决复杂问题的能力。


<details>

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在逐步推理中变得过于冗长的问题，以提高推断效率。

Method: 使用标准的带可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方法，对模型进行训练。

Result: 实验显示，在RLVR方法下，模型的输出长度减半，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 通过保留和适度增加中等简单问题的比重，模型在处理更困难问题时可以保持输出简练，而不导致输出长度的膨胀。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗提供的生存期延长有限，患者反应的差异要求进行个性化治疗，但研究受到患者样本小、数据稀疏和缺乏明确定义的限制。

Method: 我们提出了一种基于疾病进展声明评分的聚类方法，通过多种描述变量集成医学专业知识，结合了多种距离度量。

Result: 在来自图尔大学医院的353名ALS患者的数据集上进行评估，结果显示我们的方法在生存分析中优于先进方法，并且获得了可比的轮廓得分。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在生存分析中优于现有的先进方法，并在聚类的可解释性和相关性方面为医学专家提供了更大的帮助。

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Motivation: 传统的机器学习预测方法依赖特定的气体相关特征，导致规模化受限且效率低下，需寻找新的解决方案以应对这种挑战。

Method: 通过深度学习提取多模态结构和化学特征，并通过跨模态注意力机制融合这些特征，构建了COFAP框架。

Result: COFAP在hypoCOFs数据集上取得了新的SOTA，发现高性能COFs通常集中在较窄的孔径和表面积范围内。

Conclusion: COFAP有效提高了气体吸附预测的效率与准确性，并对具有优越性能的COFs进行了分类与排序。

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨KT模型的可解释性是否实际帮助教师做出教学决策。

Method: 通过模拟研究和人类教师的决策实验，比较可解释和不可解释KT模型的效果。

Result: 可解释KT模型在理论上能更快实现学习掌握，教师对其更信赖，但实际掌握所需任务数相似。

Conclusion: KT模型的可解释性对人类教师的决策影响复杂，需进一步研究教师如何理解和使用这些模型。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Motivation: 为了解决脑电图信号中普遍存在的噪声和伪影问题，提供一种自动化且有效的预处理方法，以提高数据质量和下游分析的可重复性。

Method: 通过五步过程，包括带通滤波、线路噪音过滤和坏通道拒绝，以及基于聚类算法的独立成分分析，NeuroClean实现了信号的高效清洗。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证后，NeuroClean成功清除了多种伪影，并在运动任务中相比原始数据显著提升了模型的准确性，从74%提升至97%。

Conclusion: NeuroClean是一种有效的EEG和LFP信号预处理管道，能够显著提升数据清洗后的机器学习性能，优化过程自动化并减少人为干预带来的偏差。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Motivation: 动态推测解码的目标是智能地决定草稿的令牌数量，从而实现最大速度提升，而现有方法依赖手动调优的敏感阈值，效率低且推广性差。

Method: 提出了一种基于多臂老虎机的在线、无训练、即插即用算法，能够在多个无参数的动态推测策略中进行选择。

Result: 在不同模型对和数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了TapOut在加速方面的竞争力。

Conclusion: TapOut算法在动态推测策略选择中表现出色，能够在无需超参数调整的情况下实现竞争性或更优的加速效果。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: EM 行为在不同任务中具有可预测的结构，这为参数空间可解释性和基于权重的干预研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Result: 在合成高斯混合模型和实际金融、气候、生物等数据集上，QEGM显著降低了尾部KL散度，并提升了稀有事件的召回率和覆盖校准。

Conclusion: QEGM在稀有事件预测中展现出优越性，能有效减少尾部KL散度并提高稀有事件的召回率和覆盖校准。

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Motivation: 针对现有的注意力实现效率低下的问题，尝试提出一种更加灵活的解决方案。

Method: 介绍了Flashlight这一编译器原生框架，能够自动生成融合的FlashAttention风格内核，支持任意基于注意力的程序。

Result: Flashlight生成的内核在性能上与FlexAttention相当或更优，支持更广泛的数据依赖注意力模型。

Conclusion: Flashlight framework显著提高了注意力计算效率，超越了FlexAttention的能力，并且兼容原生PyTorch代码，支持开发者快速探索新模型。

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Shapley数据评价方法在大规模数据上计算上不可行，因此需要一种更有效的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于统计杠杆得分的几何替代方法，用于评估数据点的重要性并进行有效的样本选择。

Result: 验证了提出的杠杆得分满足Shapley评价的基本公理，并且在主动学习实验中，使用基于ridge杠杆得分的采样方法超越了传统基准。

Conclusion: 通过在数据评估和下游决策质量之间建立严格的联系，提出的基于统计杠杆得分的方法在主动学习实验中表现出优越性，超越了标准基准。

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Method: 通过分析具有256至512维的INRs，评估其内在维度并探讨其对空间分辨率和输入模态的敏感性。

Conclusion: 本研究首次探讨了地理隐式神经表示（INRs）的内在维度，揭示其内在维度与下游任务性能相关，并为模型评估提供了一种无监督的度量方法。

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

Conclusion: 新的损失函数在处理大型噪声和多样化噪声分布方面表现优越，增强了机器学习任务的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Motivation: 虽然变异依赖的后悔界限在背景多臂赌博机的研究中引起了越来越多的关注，但采样基础的算法，如汤普森采样，仍然较少被研究。

Method: 我们提出了一种新的变异感知的汤普森采样算法FGTSVA，利用了抽象化技术，拓展了去耦合系数的分析。

Result: FGTSVA在一般奖励函数下达成一种最优的后悔界限，其后悔界限为$	ilde{O}(	ext{dc} 	imes 	ext{log}|	ext{F}| 	imes 	ext{总轮次} + 	ext{dc})$。

Conclusion: FGTSVA算法在一般奖励函数的上下文多臂赌博机中具有最佳的后悔界限，尤其在背景线性多臂赌博机中与基于UCB的算法的后悔界限相匹配。

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Motivation: 因为现实中观测数据常常不完整，这影响了空气质量的可靠推断和风险评估，因此需要提出新方法来处理缺失数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于通道门控学习单元的时空贝叶斯神经场框架，结合傅里叶特征和图注意力编码器。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上进行了系统评价，CGLUBNF在多种缺失数据模式下表现出优越的预测准确性和更好的置信区间。

Conclusion: CGLUBNF在预测准确性和置信区间上优于现有方法，并为未来基于深度学习的时空预测研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Result: OmniField在多种基准测试中表现优于八种强基线，能在噪声测试中保持接近清洁输入的性能。

Conclusion: OmniField在多模态时空学习中表现优越，具备高度鲁棒性，能够处理噪声和不规则数据。

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

Motivation: 大多数对象中心的强化学习方法通过单个对象因子化状态，同时隐式地处理交互。引入FIOC-WM旨在提高样本效率和策略学习的泛化能力，利用一个统一框架学习对象及其交互的结构化表示。

Method: FIOC-WM首先从像素中学习对象中心的潜在变量和交互结构，利用预训练的视觉编码器。然后，学习的世界模型将任务分解为可组合的交互原语，并在其上训练分层策略：高层选择交互的类型和顺序，低层执行这些交互。

Result: FIOC-WM通过解耦和模块化表示对象交互来捕捉环境动态，从而提高策略学习的样本效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: FIOC-WM在模拟机器人和具身人工智能基准测试中表现出更高的策略学习样本效率和泛化能力，显示出显式的模块化交互学习对稳健控制的重要性。

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）采用混合专家（MoE）架构，解码延迟成为了一个关键问题，尤其是在自回归生成期间。

Method: 我们提出了一种动态重新路由token到expert映射的框架，以降低激活的expert数量，从而减少解码延迟。

Result: 通过对Qwen3-30B和Qwen3-235B模型进行实证评估，我们的方法在批大小为16时分别实现了39%和15%的解码延迟减少。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在不显著降低准确率的情况下，实现了MoE层解码延迟的显著减少。

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate

  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed

  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Conclusion: FQKL框架在捕捉复杂时间相关性方面优于传统的联邦学习基线，同时显著减少了通信开销，显示出量子核在联邦环境中的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

TL;DR: FP8-Flow-MoE通过改进的FP8数据流和减少类型转换，显著提高MoE模型训练效率和内存优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有低精度训练仍依赖于频繁的量化-反量化转换，导致FP8的理论效率未能充分发挥，因此需要一种新的方法来优化这一过程。

Method: 采用FP8训练配方，利用具有缩放感知转置和融合FP8操作的数据流，减少显式类型转换操作。

Result: 在671B参数的MoE模型上，FP8-Flow-MoE实现了高达21%的吞吐量提升和每个GPU减少16.5 GB的内存使用。

Conclusion: FP8-Flow-MoE通过量化一致的FP8数据流，显著提高MoE模型的计算效率和内存使用，同时保持模型的收敛稳定性。

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Conclusion: 序列推理方法在大多数配置中均优于平行自一致性策略，且引入的逆熵加权投票进一步提高了准确性，表明序列细化是现代大型语言模型推理的强健默认策略。

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

Conclusion: RoME模型在跨域训练上显著提高了对未见领域的泛化能力，并在每个单独领域的表现上也有所提升。

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

Conclusion: 该方法在处理复杂的合成分布和稀疏逻辑回归后验方面表现显著优越，并在具有弱似然性和强漏斗几何特征的层次贝叶斯模型后验中实现了更高的有效样本量。

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的EvoOOD框架在处理动态图的OOD泛化问题上优于现有方法，尤其是在非平稳环境中表现突出。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM架构在心脏音频信号的心律失常识别中表现优异，达到了99.42%的测试准确率和98.85%的F1得分。

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Conclusion: 该算法在未知空间环境中的覆盖控制问题上表现出色，能够在探索和利用之间有效权衡。

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Conclusion: 需要明确建模训练方差，以验证医学影像系统的有效性。

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Conclusion: 本研究提出的球面知识图嵌入模型（SKGE）在多个基准数据集上表现出色，表明几何先验在KGE模型设计中的重要性。

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的评估显示，BRAINS在分类疾病严重性和识别认知衰退早期迹象方面的有效性。

Conclusion: BRAINS在早期阿尔茨海默病检测中展现出强大的潜力，为可扩展和可解释的诊断提供了希望。

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Result: 在合成数据集和基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在解决CLRP和OCLRP时具有更高的解质量和更好的泛化性能.

Conclusion: 提出的DRLHQ方法在解决CLRP和OCLRP方面优于传统和基于DRL的方法.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative

utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited

TL;DR: 我们提出了一种新的超参数优化方法，允许用户输入专家知识和偏好，能够有效处理误导性先验，从而提高优化效果并与传统方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管超参数优化在多个应用中表现出色，但机器学习专家对其黑箱性质和有限用户控制能力的接受度仍然有限，因此需要改进以允许用户实时干预。

Method: 我们提出了一种新颖的方法，允许在HPO过程中通过用户输入（包括专家知识和用户偏好）对贝叶斯优化进行重复干预，并引入了误导性先验检测机制。

Result: 实验评估表明，我们的方法能够有效整合多个先验，利用信息丰富的先验，同时可靠地拒绝误导性先验。

Conclusion: 我们的方法在高超参数优化中成功地结合了用户输入的专家知识和偏好，同时有效拒绝或克服误导性先验，从而实现了与未干扰贝叶斯优化的竞争力。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DClamp-PPO是一种改进的PPO算法，针对更新时比率往‘错误’方向移动的问题，通过引入惩罚机制加以解决，从而在多个任务中表现更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有PPO算法被广泛认可，但其在优化过程中常常因随机性而向‘错误’方向调整比率，这一关键问题被忽视。

Method: 提出了方向性限制PPO算法，通过引入惩罚机制来惩罚进入严格‘错误’方向区域的动作，以此修改目标行为。

Result: DClamp-PPO在各MuJoCo环境中的实验表明，其能有效地防止比率向‘错误’方向移动，提升了优化效率。

Conclusion: DClamp-PPO算法在多个MuJoCo环境中，与PPO及其变体相比，表现更为优越，能够更有效地避免“错误”方向的更新，同时保持重要性比率接近1。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Method: 我们通过引入有效的VC维度，并结合对RER类的研究，分析了CPAC学习的相关性质和条件。

Result:  CPAC学习的有效VC维度可高于传统意义，而CPAC可学习性可以通过RER类的包含性来表征。

Conclusion: 通过研究可计算的概率近似正确（CPAC）学习与可递归枚举可表示（RER）类之间的联系，我们发现有效的VC维度可取任意值，同时证明了具备独特识别性质的CPAC可学习类必然是RER。

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Motivation: 旨在优化天然气市场中的储存管理策略，以提高市场价格的稳定性和响应能力。

Method: 通过深度强化学习算法（特别是Soft Actor Critic）训练储存运营商政策，并分析其对市场价格和供需动态的影响。

Result: 使用GasRL，发现SAC算法在实现储存运营商的多重目标方面表现优越，并且模拟出的均衡价格动态与现实价格特征相符，且最低储存阈值提升了市场应对供应冲击的韧性。

Conclusion: GasRL模拟器有效结合了天然气市场和储存运营商的决策，通过深度强化学习算法优化存货管理，对市场均衡价格和供需动态产生积极影响。

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL在非凸平滑损失函数下能够保证有限时间收敛，并在面对各种拜占庭攻击策略时展现出卓越的速度、准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

Conclusion: 使用校准方法能够有效提高错误标记实例检测的准确性和鲁棒性，为工业应用提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Motivation: 在大规模语言模型的微调中，由于反向传播带来的内存开销，寻求零阶或无导数的优化策略变得吸引人。

Method: ConMeZO通过自适应方向采样来加速收敛，采用围绕动量估计的锥形限制，集中搜索在更有可能包含真实梯度的方向上。

Result: 理论上，ConMeZO在最坏情况下的收敛速率与MeZO相同；实证上，它在自然语言任务微调中表现出显著的加速。

Conclusion: ConMeZO在大规模语言模型的微调中比MeZO快2倍，同时保持了零阶方法的低内存消耗。

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Conclusion: VecComp框架能够有效提升向量函数的计算性能，并在多路径衰落信道条件下具备较强的抗干扰能力。

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Result: Adam在训练损失较小时，通过自适应方式减小特定的尖锐性度量，表现出与SGD不同的行为，且在稀疏线性回归问题上实现了更好的稀疏性和泛化效果。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了Adam优化器在解决方案上与SGD的质的不同，并提出了一个统一的分析框架，适用于多种自适应梯度方法的优化表现。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Conclusion: 该方法在训练过程中显著降低了每个客户端的数据泄露风险，同时保持了模型的准确性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Conclusion: TabTune是一个统一的库，标准化了表格基础模型的工作流程，支持多种适应策略，并自动化模型感知的预处理和评估模块。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.
However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing
pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a
single interface. TabTune provides consistent access to seven state-of-the-art
models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的方法FPP，用于保护联邦学习中的数据隐私，并能快速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护联邦学习中的数据隐私，同时对抗潜在的攻击者。

Method: 采用评估轮次和恢复训练的方式，实现安全聚合和隐私保护。

Result: 实验表明，FPP与其他方法相比，收敛速度更快，且在恶意参与者存在时也能收敛。

Conclusion: FPP实现了快速收敛，并能够抵御恶意参与者的模型污染攻击。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着遥感卫星数量的增加，研究模型在新卫星上的泛化能力变得愈发重要。

Method: 开发了GeoCrossBench基准，并自我监督地扩展了ChannelViT模型，进行性能测试和比较。

Result: ChiViT模型在处理没有重叠波段的新卫星时表现优于其他模型，但在测试时增加额外波段会导致通用模型的性能下降。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了GeoCrossBench基准和ChiViT模型，以提高遥感模型在跨卫星数据集上的表现。

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架DVB，用于检验大型语言模型是否学习深层人类价值观，结果显示所有模型的深层价值泛化率均低于随机水平，凸显了当前模型在对齐方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型是否能够学习到人类的基本价值观，而不仅仅是表面的偏好，为人工智能对齐提供重要见解。

Method: 通过实验设计控制深层价值观与浅层特征之间的混杂，在训练阶段让LLMs接触到带有相关性的人类偏好数据，在测试阶段打破这些相关性，测量模型的深层价值泛化率(DVGR)。

Result: 在9个不同模型中，平均DVGR仅为0.30，所有模型的深层价值泛化能力都低于随机猜测，且更大的模型相比于小模型泛化能力略低。

Conclusion: DVB提供了一种可解释的对齐核心特征的测量方法，揭示大规模语言模型在学习深层次人类价值观时的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

Result: Re-FORC实现了计算资源的显著节省，同时在多个条件下提升了模型的准确性。

Conclusion: Re-FORC是一种自适应奖励预测方法，能够根据上下文预测未来预期奖励，并有效减少计算资源同时提高准确性。

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高风险情况下的个人决策模型常常偏离群体最优预测，本研究旨在通过新的框架解决信息整合的问题。

Method: ATHENA框架包含两个阶段：首先，通过大型语言模型增强的符号发现来发现群体层面的符号效用函数；其次，通过个体层面的语义适应，创建个性化的语义模板以模拟个性化选择。

Result: ATHENA在真实的旅行方式和疫苗选择任务中表现优于现有模型，F1得分比最强的前沿模型提升至少6.5%。

Conclusion: ATHENA框架通过结合符号效用建模和语义适应，提供了一种新方案来建模以人为中心的决策，且在真实场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: STRMAC框架在协作任务中表现出色，显著提高了多智能体系统的效率和效果。

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

Result: 在TAT-QA、TableBench和其他数据集上实现了显著的准确率提升，证明了该框架的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了大型语言模型在复杂表格数值推理方面的性能。

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 8.79%, 6.08%, and
19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a
robust solution for complex tabular numerical reasoning. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing LLM performance for
complex tabular numerical reasoning. Data and code are available upon request.

TL;DR: 本研究引入了一种新框架，将模态跟随分解为相对推理不确定性和固有模态偏好，发现这两个因素共同影响模型在处理矛盾信息时的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不同模态提供矛盾信息时，MLLMs需要解决冲突，先前工作仅通过粗略的数据集层统计来测量这种行为。

Method: 通过构建一个可控的数据集，系统地变化视觉和文本输入的推理难度，使用熵作为细粒度的不确定性度量。

Result: 发现模态跟随的概率随着相对不确定性的增加而单调下降，在模型倾向于以可比概率跟随两种模态的平衡点处揭示了固有偏好的实用指标。

Conclusion: 相对不确定性和固有偏好是模态跟随的两个主要原则，提供了量化框架和对MLLMs如何解决冲突信息的机制洞察。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

Conclusion: 通过引入可验证的多项选择重构（VMR）策略，我们的方法在开放式任务上有效提升了大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,

psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

### [161] [The ORCA Benchmark: Evaluating Real-World Calculation Accuracy in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02589)
*Claudia Herambourg,Dawid Siuda,Anna Szczepanek,Julia Kopczyńska,Joao R. L. Santos,Wojciech Sas,Joanna Śmietańska-Nowak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA基准评估显示当前大型语言模型在真实量化推理任务中的准确性较低，且存在领域特异性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出ORCA基准的动机在于创建一个评估大型语言模型在实际应用中定量推理能力的标准。

Method: 通过500个自然语言任务，对五种最先进的系统进行了评估，分析了它们在真实问题上的表现。

Result: 五种系统的准确率仅为45%到63%，在不同领域的表现差异明显，显示出局部互补性。

Conclusion: ORCA基准展示了现代大型语言模型在多领域定量推理中存在的局限性，并强调了其在特定领域的优势和劣势。

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

TL;DR: DecompSR是一个大规模的基准数据集，旨在分析LLM的组合空间推理能力，通过可变组合性方面和符号验证确保其正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了分析组合空间推理能力，提供具有多个可独立变化的组合性方面的大规模基准数据集。

Method: 通过程序化构建数据集，并使用符号解算器进行独立验证，以确保数据集的正确性。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在组合性推理任务中的生产性和系统性概括能力较弱，但对语言变异更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DecompSR是一个经过验证的基准数据集，能够有效评估大型语言模型的组合推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个新的基准框架，以评估多智能体的协作能力，发现存在协作缺口，并建议通过‘接力推理’改善智能体之间的协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI的发展，越来越依赖于独立开发的多智能体系统，而有效的协作在其中至关重要。

Method: 通过设计协作迷宫求解基准，评估32种智能体模型在不同情况下的协作表现，并对协作能力进行隔离与复杂性调节。

Result: 研究发现存在‘协作缺口’，表明单独表现优秀的模型在协作时绩效大幅下降。另外，借助强者先行的策略可以改善协作结果。

Conclusion: 本研究强调在多智能体系统中评估与提升合作能力的重要性，尤其在一方较强的情况下，能够显著改善协作效果。

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware
evaluation, (2) training strategies developed to enhance collaborative
capabilities, and (3) interaction design that reliably elicits agents' latent
skills, guidance that applies to AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本论文介绍了跨度查询，旨在提高推理服务器对非聊天用例的支持，通过新的查询结构实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着客户端需求的演变，推理服务器需要适应多种非聊天用例的需求，而现有方案往往仅针对单一用例进行优化。

Method: 通过定义跨度查询的语法和语义，优化推理服务器的KV缓存本地性，并对vLLM进行小幅改动来实现高性能执行。

Result: 实验表明，跨度查询在两个不同的非聊天用例中实现了10-20倍的TTFT减少，并且优化的注意力局部性提升了推理准确性。

Conclusion: 引入的跨度查询能够显著提高非聊天用例的推理效率，并在大规模模型上展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

Motivation: 针对控制工程领域快速增长的研究产出，需要新的方法来结构化和形式化领域知识。

Method: 基于PyIRK框架，利用语言模型将自然语言描述和数学定义转换为形式化的知识图谱。

Conclusion: 本研究通过LMM支持的方法，实现了面向控制工程领域的形式化知识表示生成，促进了知识的可访问性和协作性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

TL;DR: EvoMem是一种新型多智能体框架，通过引入人类记忆机制，提高了复杂问题的规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望探索人类-like记忆在多智能体框架中的作用，以提升自然语言规划中的推理和纠错能力。

Method: 提出EvoMem框架，包含约束提取器、验证器和执行者三个智能体，配备约束记忆和查询反馈记忆两种记忆模块。

Result: 在旅行规划、会议规划和日程安排中的评估显示，EvoMem的性能持续改进，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EvoMem框架展示了人类记忆在多智能体规划中的重要性，通过双重演变记忆机制显著提升了规划性能。

Abstract: Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving
complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have
begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within
these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents
coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where
iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the
success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present
EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The
framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor)
and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries
by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a
query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by
accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory
modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip
planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance
improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success
underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为ACC-MARL的新框架，能够有效学习多任务、多智能体的合作策略，并实现低样本效率和任务条件的分配优化。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for
cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized
execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the
decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to
agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited
to the single-task case. In this work, we present Automata-Conditioned
Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (ACC-MARL), a framework for
learning task-conditioned, decentralized team policies. We identify the main
challenges to ACC-MARL's feasibility in practice, propose solutions, and prove
the correctness of our approach. We further show that the value functions of
learned policies can be used to assign tasks optimally at test time.
Experiments show emergent task-aware, multi-step coordination among agents,
e.g., pressing a button to unlock a door, holding the door, and
short-circuiting tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的训练方法未能充分整合不同模态的信息，限制了模型的推理能力。

Method: 该研究使用Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU)模型，通过交错音频标记与文本提示进行实验。

Result: 研究表明，零-shot交错提示已能提高推理任务的表现，而少量的微调则能进一步提升结果，但会影响音频标记能力。

Conclusion: 在对音频多模态大语言模型的研究中，交错提示的训练方法提高了推理任务的性能，但会牺牲模型的音频标记能力。

Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves
concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text
prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities,
limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning
capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning
in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using
the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an
experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our
newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing
on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even
zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a
small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the
results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无线视频传输方案仅在像素级别进行编码，忽视了视频中的内在语义，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出了一种新的无线路视频语义通信框架，通过语义帧编码和参考语义帧替换运动矢量来进行视频编码，使用双阶段条件扩散过程生成补偿的当前语义帧。

Result: WVSC-D通过语义级别的视频编码和引入参考语义帧，改善了视频传输的带宽效率，实验结果显示在PSNR上较DVSC提升约1.8 dB。

Conclusion: WVSC-D在视频传输中提高了带宽效率，并在PSNR方面相较于其他深度学习方法显著提升。

Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in
pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this
paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with
decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D,
which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video
transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic
frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations,
enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover,
to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is
introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding
methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current
semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the
reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth
efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance.
Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based
methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.

Result: 提供不同类型的反馈后，发现各类反馈均对增强个体间的同步活动产生积极影响，建议在反馈系统设计中考虑这些因素。

Conclusion: 视觉、听觉和触觉反馈能够有效增强个体间同步活动的强度，提升亲社会情感的体验。

Abstract: When several individuals collaborate on a shared task, their brain activities
often synchronize. This phenomenon, known as Inter-brain Synchronization (IBS),
is notable for inducing prosocial outcomes such as enhanced interpersonal
feelings, including closeness, trust, empathy, and more. Further strengthening
the IBS with the aid of external feedback would be beneficial for scenarios
where those prosocial feelings play a vital role in interpersonal
communication, such as rehabilitation between a therapist and a patient, motor
skill learning between a teacher and a student, and group performance art. This
paper investigates whether visual, auditory, and haptic feedback of the IBS
level can further enhance its intensity, offering design recommendations for
feedback systems in IBS. We report findings when three different types of
feedback were provided: IBS level feedback by means of on-body projection
mapping, sonification using chords, and vibration bands attached to the wrist.

Result: 通过集成3D视觉反馈，提高了学员的深度感知、接触意识和工具方向理解，优化了多种外科操作任务的培训效果。

Conclusion: 该AI辅助训练框架显著提升了外科训练生的空间意识和操作安全性，解决了传统训练方法的局限性。

Abstract: Laparoscopic surgery constrains surgeons spatial awareness because procedures
are performed through a monocular, two-dimensional (2D) endoscopic view.
Conventional training methods using dry-lab models or recorded videos provide
limited depth cues, often leading trainees to misjudge instrument position and
perform ineffective or unsafe maneuvers. To address this limitation, we present
an AI-assisted training framework developed in NVIDIA Isaac Sim that couples
the standard 2D laparoscopic feed with synchronized three-dimensional (3D)
visual feedback delivered through a mixed-reality (MR) interface. While
trainees operate using the clinical 2D view, validated AI modules continuously
localize surgical instruments and detect instrument-tissue interactions in the
background. When spatial misjudgments are detected, 3D visual feedback are
displayed to trainees, while preserving the original operative perspective. Our
framework considers various surgical tasks including navigation, manipulation,
transfer, cutting, and suturing. Visually similar 2D cases can be disambiguated
through the added 3D context, improving depth perception, contact awareness,

Method: 我们通过众包的方式收集了508个日常个人视频，并对VLM的推理能力进行了基准测试，评估其与人类表现的差异。

Result: VLM在推理能力上显著优于人类评估者，推理风险与视频特征和提示策略密切相关，同时模型生成的解释与证据之间存在脱节，常见对象可能误导推理。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了视觉语言模型（VLM）在推测个人属性方面的超能力，同时指出其解释能力的不足，提出了对个人隐私的潜在风险。

Abstract: The proliferation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) introduces profound
privacy risks from personal videos. This paper addresses the critical yet
unexplored inferential privacy threat, the risk of inferring sensitive personal
attributes over the data. To address this gap, we crowdsourced a dataset of 508
everyday personal videos from 58 individuals. We then conducted a benchmark
study evaluating VLM inference capabilities against human performance. Our
findings reveal three critical insights: (1) VLMs possess superhuman
inferential capabilities, significantly outperforming human evaluators,
leveraging a shift from object recognition to behavioral inference from
temporal streams. (2) Inferential risk is strongly correlated with factors such
as video characteristics and prompting strategies. (3) VLM-driven explanation
towards the inference is unreliable, as we revealed a disconnect between the
model-generated explanations and evidential impact, identifying ubiquitous
objects as misleading confounders.

Abstract: Adherence to healthy diets reduces chronic illness risk, yet rates remain
low. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for health
communication but often struggle to engage individuals with ambivalent
intentions at a pivotal stage of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). We developed
CounselLLM, an open-source model enhanced through persona design and few-shot,
domain-specific prompts grounded in TTM and Motivational Interviewing (MI). In
controlled evaluations, CounselLLM showed stronger use of TTM subprocesses and
MI affirmations than human counselors, with comparable linguistic robustness
but expressed in more concrete terms. A user study then tested CounselLLM in an
interactive counseling setting against a baseline system. While knowledge and
perceptions did not change, participants' intentions for immediate dietary
change increased significantly after interacting with CounselLLM. Participants
also rated it as easy to use, understandable, and supportive. These findings
suggest theory-driven LLMs can effectively engage ambivalent individuals and
provide a scalable approach to digital counseling.

the platform and workers, information asymmetries caused by black-boxed
algorithms and value misalignments in the infrastructure design process. With
the OpenCourier protocol, we outline a blueprint for community-owned ecosystem
of delivery platforms that centers worker agency, transparency, and bottom-up
design.

Abstract: Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention
across both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an
essential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to
human-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil
detection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for
further gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a
multi-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the
first time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the
inherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a
transformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye
and head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional
body movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,
and HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms
conventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series
imputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses
confirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match
actual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.
Moreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable
devices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture
in the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our
method paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in
real-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based
analysis and interaction across various application domains.

### [178] [Emotional Contagion in Code: How GitHub Emoji Reactions Shape Developer Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02515)
*Obada Kraishan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究分析了GitHub上的表情符号反应，发现积极情感在技术讨论中占主导地位，并对讨论轨迹产生显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨开发者社区如何使用表情符号反应进行交流，以及这些情感信号如何传播和影响技术讨论。

Method: 对50个受欢迎的GitHub存储库中的2098个问题和拉取请求进行分析，研究106,743个表情符号反应的模式。

Result: 发现57.4%的讨论带有积极情感，积极情感的传播现象远多于负面情感，强烈情感传播的统计分析显示其重要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，表情符号反应在软件开发中的讨论中扮演着重要的角色，积极情感的传播对技术讨论的轨迹有显著影响。

Abstract: Developer communities increasingly rely on emoji reactions to communicate,
but we know little about how these emotional signals spread and influence
technical discussions. We analyzed 2,098 GitHub issues and pull requests across
50 popular repositories, examining patterns in 106,743 emoji reactions to
understand emotional contagion in software development. Our findings reveal a
surprisingly positive emotional landscape: 57.4% of discussions carry positive
sentiment, with positive emotional cascades outnumbering negative ones 23:1. We
identified five distinct patterns, with "instant enthusiasm" affecting 45.6% of
items--nearly half receive immediate positive reinforcement. Statistical
analysis confirms strong emotional contagion (r=0.679, p<0.001) with a massive
effect size (d=2.393), suggesting that initial reactions powerfully shape
discussion trajectories. These findings challenge assumptions about technical
discourse being purely rational, demonstrating that even minimal emotional
signals create measurable ripple effects. Our work provides empirical evidence
that emoji reactions are not mere decoration but active forces shaping
collaborative outcomes in software development.

### [179] [DropleX: Liquid sensing on tablet touchscreens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02694)
*Siqi Zhang,Mayank Goel,Justin Chan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DropleX是首个利用触摸屏进行液体检测的系统，能够在不修改硬件的情况下，实现高精准的液体掺伪和污染检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个无须硬件修改的液体检测系统，填补现有设备在液体样本检测方面的空白。

Method: 通过禁用触摸屏内置的自适应过滤器来探索液体传感机制，结合信号处理和学习策略。

Result: DropleX在多种液体的掺伪检测中表现出高达99%的准确率，显示出其在液体传感领域的潜力与应用价值。

Conclusion: DropleX系统能够有效实现对液体的精确检测，为日常设备上的液体传感开启了新机遇。

Abstract: We present DropleX, the first system that enables liquid sensing using the
capacitive touchscreen of commodity tablets. DropleX detects microliter-scale
liquid samples, and performs non-invasive, through-container measurements to
detect whether a drink has been spiked or if a sealed liquid has been
contaminated. These capabilities are made possible by a physics-informed
mechanism that disables the touchscreen's built-in adaptive filters, originally
designed to reject the effects of liquid drops such as rain, without any
hardware modifications. We model the touchscreen's sensing capabilities,
limits, and non-idealities to inform the design of a signal processing and
learning-based pipeline for liquid sensing. Our system achieves 96-99% accuracy
in detecting microliter-scale adulteration in soda, wine, and milk, 93-96%
accuracy in threshold detection of trace chemical concentrations, and 86-96%
accuracy in through-container adulterant detection. Given the predominance of
touchscreens, these exploratory results can open new opportunities for liquid
sensing on everyday devices.

*You-Jin Kim,Misha Sra,Tobias Höllerer*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探索了在AR舞蹈表演中虚拟观众的作用，发现其能够增强社交体验，但某些参与者在无虚拟观众的情况下感受到更强的积极情绪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着增强现实技术的发展，创造更接近真实的大型活动体验变得越来越重要，尤其是在缺乏现场观众的情况下。

Method: 通过问卷调查和体验报告，比较有虚拟观众和没有观众的AR舞蹈表演对用户反应和行为的影响。

Result: 模拟的虚拟观众提升了AR用户对表演的兴趣和参与感，参与者更倾向于偏好有虚拟观众的体验。

Conclusion: 虚拟观众的存在增强了观众对表演的社交体验感，但对于某些参与者，缺乏虚拟观众的演出引发了更强烈的积极情感。

Abstract: Audience reactions can considerably enhance live experiences; conversely, in
anytime-anywhere augmented reality (AR) experiences, large crowds of people
might not always be available to congregate. To get closer to simulating live
events with large audiences, we created a mobile AR experience where users can
wander around naturally and engage in AR theater with virtual audiences trained
from real audiences using imitation learning. This allows us to carefully
capture the essence of human imperfections and behavior in artificial
intelligence (AI) audiences. The result is a novel mobile AR experience in
which solitary AR users experience an augmented performance in a physical space
with a virtual audience. Virtual dancers emerge from the surroundings,
accompanied by a digitally simulated audience, to provide a community
experience akin to immersive theater. In a pilot study, simulated human avatars
were vastly preferred over just audience audio commentary. We subsequently
engaged 20 participants as attendees of an AR dance performance, comparing a
no-audience condition with a simulated audience of six onlookers. Through
questionnaires and experience reports, we investigated user reactions and
behavior. Our results demonstrate that the presence of virtual audience members
caused attendees to perceive the performance as a social experience with
increased interest and involvement in the event. On the other hand, for some
attendees, the dance performances without the virtual audience evoked a
stronger positive sentiment.

Abstract: The explosion of scientific literature has made the efficient and accurate
extraction of structured data a critical component for advancing scientific
knowledge and supporting evidence-based decision-making. However, existing
tools often struggle to extract and structure multimodal, varied, and
inconsistent information across documents into standardized formats. We
introduce SciDaSynth, a novel interactive system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automatically generates structured data tables according to
users' queries by integrating information from diverse sources, including text,
tables, and figures. Furthermore, SciDaSynth supports efficient table data
validation and refinement, featuring multi-faceted visual summaries and
semantic grouping capabilities to resolve cross-document data inconsistencies.
A within-subjects study with nutrition and NLP researchers demonstrates
SciDaSynth's effectiveness in producing high-quality structured data more
efficiently than baseline methods. We discuss design implications for human-AI
collaborative systems supporting data extraction tasks. The system code is
available at https://github.com/xingbow/SciDaEx
