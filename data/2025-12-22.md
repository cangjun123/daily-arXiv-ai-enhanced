Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong perception and reasoning performance on existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks. However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Yunkaidang/RSHR

Result: 在四个主要指导性视频编辑任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在编辑质量和准确性方面具有优越性。

Conclusion: ReCo通过创新的约束建模机制有效地解决了指导性视频编辑中的关键问题，为这一领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The In-context generation paradigm recently has demonstrated strong power in instructional image editing with both data efficiency and synthesis quality. Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.

Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: While deep learning models have shown strong performance in simulating neural responses, they often fail to clearly separate stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, which limits their ability to generalize across stimuli and individuals. We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.

Abstract: Generating long, cohesive video stories with consistent characters is a significant challenge for current text-to-video AI. We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Endo-SemiS, a semi-supervised segmentation framework for providing reliable segmentation of endoscopic video frames with limited annotation. EndoSemiS uses 4 strategies to improve performance by effectively utilizing all available data, particularly unlabeled data: (1) Cross-supervision between two individual networks that supervise each other; (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which are generated by selecting high-confidence regions to improve their quality; (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision, which aggregates reliable pixels from the pseudo-labels of both networks to provide accurate supervision for unlabeled data; and (4) Mutual learning, where both networks learn from each other at the feature and image levels, reducing variance and guiding them toward a consistent solution. Additionally, a separate corrective network that utilizes spatiotemporal information from endoscopy video to improve segmentation performance. Endo-SemiS is evaluated on two clinical applications: kidney stone laser lithotomy from ureteroscopy and polyp screening from colonoscopy. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, Endo-SemiS substantially achieves superior results on both datasets with limited labeled data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MedICL-VU/Endo-SemiS

Motivation: 现有的长视频理解基准通常只关注时间长度或多模态丰富度之一，且主要依赖单一准确度分数，无法清晰展示模型失败的具体模式，需要更全面的评估标准。

Method: 通过可扩展的人工验证流程创建LongShOTBench基准，包含视频、音频、语音多模态推理和工具使用任务，每个项目都有参考答案和分级评分标准。同时还提出了LongShOTAgent系统，采用预处理、搜索和迭代优化方法分析长视频。

Result: 在LongShOTBench上，当前最先进模型表现不佳：Gemini-2.5-Flash仅52.95%，开源模型低于30%，LongShOTAgent达到44.66%，显示真实世界长视频理解的困难性。

Conclusion: LongShOTBench为评估和改进多模态大语言模型提供了实用、可复现的基础，揭示了当前模型在复杂长视频理解任务上的显著局限性。

Abstract: Long-form multimodal video understanding requires integrating vision, speech, and ambient audio with coherent long-range reasoning. Existing benchmarks emphasize either temporal length or multimodal richness, but rarely both and while some incorporate open-ended questions and advanced metrics, they mostly rely on single-score accuracy, obscuring failure modes. We introduce LongShOTBench, a diagnostic benchmark with open-ended, intent-driven questions; single- and multi-turn dialogues; and tasks requiring multimodal reasoning and agentic tool use across video, audio, and speech. Each item includes a reference answer and graded rubric for interpretable, and traceable evaluation. LongShOTBench is produced via a scalable, human-validated pipeline to ensure coverage and reproducibility. All samples in our LongShOTBench are human-verified and corrected. Furthermore, we present LongShOTAgent, an agentic system that analyzes long videos via preprocessing, search, and iterative refinement. On LongShOTBench, state-of-the-art MLLMs show large gaps: Gemini-2.5-Flash achieves 52.95%, open-source models remain below 30%, and LongShOTAgent attains 44.66%. These results underscore the difficulty of real-world long-form video understanding. LongShOTBench provides a practical, reproducible foundation for evaluating and improving MLLMs. All resources are available on GitHub: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/longshot.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了4D-RGPT（专门的多模态大语言模型）、P4D训练框架和R4D-Bench基准，以增强MLLM在4D（3D+时间）感知和区域级推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有MLLM在3D结构推理和时间动态理解方面存在局限，且现有3D/4D VQA基准缺乏区域级提示和动态场景深度感知。

Method: 1）设计4D-RGPT模型以增强视频输入的4D表示和时间感知；2）提出P4D训练框架，从冻结专家模型蒸馏4D表示；3）构建R4D-Bench基准（含深度感知动态场景和区域级提示）。

Result: 4D-RGPT在现有4D VQA基准和提出的R4D-Bench上均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提升了MLLM的4D感知和区域级时空推理能力，为动态场景理解提供了新方案。

Abstract: Despite advances in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics remains limited, constrained by weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Existing 3D and 4D Video Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks also emphasize static scenes and lack region-level prompting. We tackle these issues by introducing: (a) 4D-RGPT, a specialized MLLM designed to capture 4D representations from video inputs with enhanced temporal perception; (b) Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D), a training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model into 4D-RGPT for comprehensive 4D perception; and (c) R4D-Bench, a benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, built via a hybrid automated and human-verified pipeline. Our 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark.

Abstract: The recent decline of the European forest carbon sink highlights the need for spatially explicit and frequently updated forest monitoring tools. Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: IUS为合成医学图像评估提供了一种可解释、实用导向的定量方法，能够有效指导合成数据集的选择以提高DL临床决策支持系统的开发效果。

Abstract: Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: "How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. IUS implementation is available at https://github.com/innoisys/ius

Abstract: The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.

Abstract: Maritime autonomous systems require robust predictive capabilities to anticipate vessel motion and environmental dynamics. While transformer architectures have revolutionized AIS-based trajectory prediction and demonstrated feasibility for sonar frame forecasting, their application to maritime radar frame prediction remains unexplored, creating a critical gap given radar's all-weather reliability for navigation. This survey systematically reviews predictive modeling approaches relevant to maritime radar, with emphasis on transformer architectures for spatiotemporal sequence forecasting, where existing representative methods are analyzed according to data type, architecture, and prediction horizon. Our review shows that, while the literature has demonstrated transformer-based frame prediction for sonar sensing, no prior work addresses transformer-based maritime radar frame prediction, thereby defining a clear research gap and motivating a concrete research direction for future work in this area.

Abstract: Photographs of people taken by professional photographers typically present the person in beautiful lighting, with an interesting pose, and flattering quality. This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个文档中心背景生成框架，支持多页编辑和主题连续性，通过潜在掩码自动优化可读性确保文本区域清晰可见，并通过总结-指导过程保持跨页一致性，实现了无需训练的文档背景编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文档编辑工具通常难以在自动生成背景的同时保持文本的可读性和跨页的视觉一致性。该研究旨在通过一个不需要训练的框架，实现文档背景的智能生成，确保文本区域清晰可见（满足WCAG 2.2标准），并保持多页文档的主题连续性，以弥合生成模型与自然设计流程之间的差距。

Abstract: We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

Abstract: Fine-grained fire prediction plays a crucial role in emergency response. Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

Abstract: Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Abstract: Quantifying and assessing urban greenery is consequential for planning and development, reflecting the everlasting importance of green spaces for multiple climate and well-being dimensions of cities. Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.

Abstract: Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

TL;DR: ARCD is a plug-and-play, region-guided contrastive decoding strategy that improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations in medical vision-language models without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in MedVLMs where models rely on textual priors instead of visual evidence, overcoming limitations of existing training-based (costly) and training-free (untargeted) methods.

Method: ARCD uses anatomical masks to guide a three-tiered contrastive decoding process that dynamically re-weights token, attention, and logits levels to steer model focus onto specified regions.

Result: Extensive experiments across chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound datasets show improved regional understanding, reduced hallucinations, and enhanced diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: ARCD provides an effective, data-efficient solution for targeted hallucination mitigation in clinical MedVLMs, enhancing reliability through region-specific visual grounding.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) show immense promise in clinical applicability. However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

Conclusion: CheXPO-v2通过过程监督和知识图谱一致性奖励，有效解决了医疗视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，提高了临床可靠性和安全性，同时具有优秀的数据效率

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations, compromising clinical reliability. While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to "overthink" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: Optical satellites, with their diverse band layouts and ground sampling distances, supply indispensable evidence for tasks ranging from ecosystem surveillance to emergency response. However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.

Abstract: Recent learning-based visual localization methods use global descriptors to disambiguate visually similar places, but existing approaches often derive these descriptors from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), limiting their discriminative power and reducing robustness in the presence of noisy geometric constraints. We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential but remain brittle in complex, long-chain visual reasoning tasks. A critical failure mode is "visual forgetting", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as "think longer, see less". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning "how-to-think") and (2) strategic visual perception ("when-to-look"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., "wait", "verify"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \textbf{Code}: \url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.

Conclusion: VideoDetective通过问题感知内存机制，使MLLMs能够循环寻找关键线索，在有限的上下文长度下高效处理长视频，为长视频问答提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Long Video Question-Answering (LVQA) presents a significant challenge for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to immense context and overloaded information, which could also lead to prohibitive memory consumption. While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.

Abstract: Learning directly from human demonstration videos is a key milestone toward scalable and generalizable robot learning. Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.

Abstract: Robust anatomical segmentation of chest X-rays (CXRs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive annotations and the substantial variability of real-world acquisition conditions. We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance. These results demonstrate that AnyCXR establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for anatomy-aware CXR analysis and offers a practical pathway toward reducing annotation burdens while improving robustness across diverse imaging conditions.

TL;DR: VLMIR框架利用视觉语言模型在图像修复中融合视觉感知与语义理解，通过两阶段方法提升修复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像修复方法难以同时利用视觉和语言知识来保证语义一致性，需要更有效的多模态融合方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于VLM的特征提取（对齐低/高质量图像描述的嵌入，并使用降级预测器分解特征）；2）基于扩散模型的图像修复，通过交叉注意力融合多模态特征。

Result: 在通用和特定降级修复任务中均取得优越性能，验证了视觉语言先验对图像修复的重要性。

Conclusion: VLMIR通过有效整合视觉语言模型的先验知识，提升了图像修复的视觉保真度和语义连贯性，为多模态图像修复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce RadImageNet-VQA, a large-scale dataset designed to advance radiologic visual question answering (VQA) on CT and MRI exams. Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts. The full dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/raidium/RadImageNet-VQA.

Abstract: Automated defect inspection of assembled Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA) is quite challenging due to the insufficient labeled data, micro-defects with just a few pixels in visually-complex and high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed. Full code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

Abstract: We propose a generative framework for producing high-quality PBR textures on a given 3D mesh. As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为指数移动平均引导（EMAG）的训练免费机制，用于在推理时修改扩散变换器的注意力机制，通过基于统计的自适应层选择规则生成更困难的语义忠实负样本，从而提升生成质量和人类偏好评分（HPS）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散和流匹配的生成模型中，虽然引导技术被广泛用于提升样本质量和一致性，但现有方法缺乏对负样本粒度或难度的可靠控制，且在目标层选择上通常固定。因此，需要一种能够自适应生成精细退化负样本的引导机制。

Method: 提出指数移动平均引导（EMAG）：这是一种训练免费机制，通过基于统计的自适应层选择规则，在推理时修改扩散变换器的注意力机制，生成更困难且语义忠实的负样本。该机制能自然地与APG、CADS等先进引导技术结合使用。

Result: 与CFG相比，EMAG将人类偏好评分（HPS）提升了+0.46，能暴露更困难的失败模式，并允许去噪器优化细微伪影，显著提高了生成质量。

Conclusion: EMAG通过自适应层选择生成高质量的细粒度负样本，有效改进了扩散模型的引导机制，在质量和人类偏好方面取得了显著提升，且与现有引导技术具有良好的兼容性。

Abstract: In diffusion and flow-matching generative models, guidance techniques are widely used to improve sample quality and consistency. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.

Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中表现出较强的推理能力，通过工具调用分析视觉输入实现思维链。但现有模型在推理轨迹错误时往往难以反思和自我修正

Method: 三阶段管道：1）基于高分辨率图像数据集构建高难度可验证的视觉问答对；2）冷启动监督微调，收集工具轨迹作为启动数据；3）RL阶段引入冗余惩罚策略优化，激励模型发展自反思路模式

Result: 大量的实验表明DRIM在视觉理解基准测试上取得了优越的性能

Conclusion: DRIM模型通过深度但可靠的多轮推理机制，有效提升了视觉语言模型在复杂视觉任务中的推理和自我修正能力

Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities on complex visual tasks by thinking with images in their Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is achieved by actively invoking tools to analyze visual inputs rather than merely perceiving them. However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: CodeDance通过使用可执行代码作为视觉推理的通用求解器，超越了传统基于文本链、固定视觉模式或单步流水线的方法，实现了更灵活、可解释和可迁移的复杂任务处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源方法多依赖于纯文本链、固定视觉模式或单步流水线，限制了在复杂任务上的灵活性、可解释性和迁移性，而先进的封闭模型（如o3）已展现出类似人类的“带图像思考”推理能力。

Method: 引入CodeDance框架，将可执行代码定义为视觉推理的通用求解器，通过代码定义、组合和执行来协调多种工具，计算中间结果，并生成视觉辅助（如方框、线条、图表）。同时，引入平衡自适应工具调用的奖励机制，平衡探索与效率，避免工具过度使用。

Result: 实验表明，CodeDance在多个推理基准测试（视觉搜索、数学、图表问答）中不仅持续优于模式驱动和纯文本基线，还超越了GPT-4o等先进封闭模型及更大的开源模型。此外，在RL训练中观察到新兴行为：无需任务特定微调即可实现新工具调用、未见过组合和跨任务迁移。

Conclusion: CodeDance展示了可执行视觉推理的通用且可扩展机制，通过代码驱动的灵活框架实现透明、可自检的推理，提升了复杂视觉任务的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent releases such as o3 highlight human-like "thinking with images" reasoning that combines structured tool use with stepwise verification, yet most open-source approaches still rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks. We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.

TL;DR: ADK：一种通过LLM离线生成类别描述提示的框架，以组合知识和动态注意力方式增强VLMs的少样本自适应能力，实现高效性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型（VLM）在零样本能力上表现优异，但在面对与预训练数据存在分布差异的下游任务时仍存在困难。现有的基于参数高效微调（PEFT）的少样本自适应方法依赖固定的手工提示，这些提示通常无法充分理解类别语义。虽然有些研究提出利用图像诱导提示来提供额外分类线索，但会在推理时带来难以承受的计算开销。

Method: 提出辅助描述性知识（ADK）框架，通过离线使用大型语言模型为每个类别生成丰富的描述性提示，然后将这些预计算特征以两种方式部署：（1）作为组合知识（平均表示），提供丰富的语义；（2）作为实例特定知识，通过轻量级非参数注意力机制为给定图像动态选择最相关的描述。ADK是一个无需参数的即插即用组件，可以增强现有PEFT方法。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，ADK能持续提升多种PEFT基线的性能，在各种场景下创造了新的最先进成果。

Conclusion: ADK框架通过离线生成丰富的类别描述性提示，并以组合知识和实例特定知识的形式有效丰富文本表示，在保持效率的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型在下游任务中的性能。

Abstract: Despite the impressive zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they often struggle in downstream tasks with distribution shifts from the pre-training data. Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成技术的普及引发了隐私、偏见和版权问题，概念擦除技术可通过选择性移除预训练模型中的不必要概念来提供解决方案，但现有评估方法过于简单，缺乏全面测试。

Method: 建立EMMA基准系统，针对5个关键维度(包括间接描述、视觉相似概念、性别种族偏见等)设计了12个指标，对5种概念擦除方法在5个领域(物体、名人、艺术风格、NSFW、版权)进行了评估。

Result: 现有概念擦除方法在处理间接提示时会生成本应被擦除的概念，也无法正确处理视觉相似的非目标概念，部分方法相比原始模型反而放大了性别和种族偏见。

Conclusion: 当前概念擦除技术在实际应用中存在显著局限性，需要开发更稳健、公平且能应对复杂现实场景的方法，EMMA基准为此提供了重要的评估框架。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

Abstract: Purpose: To provide a diverse, high-quality dataset of color fundus images (CFIs) with detailed artery-vein (A/V) segmentation annotations, supporting the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for vascular analysis in ophthalmology.
  Methods: CFIs were sampled from the longitudinal Rotterdam Study (RS), encompassing a wide range of ages, devices, and capture conditions. Images were annotated using a custom interface that allowed graders to label arteries, veins, and unknown vessels on separate layers, starting from an initial vessel segmentation mask. Connectivity was explicitly verified and corrected using connected component visualization tools.
  Results: The dataset includes 1024x1024-pixel PNG images in three modalities: original RGB fundus images, contrast-enhanced versions, and RGB-encoded A/V masks. Image quality varied widely, including challenging samples typically excluded by automated quality assessment systems, but judged to contain valuable vascular information.
  Conclusion: This dataset offers a rich and heterogeneous source of CFIs with high-quality segmentations. It supports robust benchmarking and training of machine learning models under real-world variability in image quality and acquisition settings.
  Translational Relevance: By including connectivity-validated A/V masks and diverse image conditions, this dataset enables the development of clinically applicable, generalizable machine learning tools for retinal vascular analysis, potentially improving automated screening and diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases.

Motivation: 传统视频帧预测在动态场景中因缺乏下一帧信息而存在误差；基于事件相机的预测方法常通过预测事件光流和像素扭曲来重建帧，但像素位移不准确会导致空洞和模糊问题

Method: 1) 使用预训练的Stable Diffusion模型的残差训练确保时序一致性；2) 包含两阶段训练：ER-VAE对齐事件帧与对应残差，扩散模型基于事件数据去噪残差潜在表示；3) 引入多样长度时序增强(DLT)提高鲁棒性

Result: DESSERT在多个任务上超越现有方法：事件驱动重建、基于图像的视频帧预测、基于事件的视频帧预测和单边事件视频帧插值，能产生更清晰、时序更一致的帧合成结果

Conclusion: 提出的DESSERT框架通过扩散模型和残差训练，结合事件相机数据，显著提升了视频帧预测的质量和时序一致性，解决了传统方法中的模糊和空洞问题，为动态场景的帧预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

Motivation: 当前病理学视觉语言模型存在三大局限性：多数只关注小区域而非整张切片、仅提供静态预测、依赖非公开数据缺乏可复现性；带详细临床标注的全切片图像（WSIs）训练数据稀缺；这些问题制约了透明、可泛化 VLMs 的发展。

Method: 1. 开发标准化工具 Polysome 自动生成合成指令；2. 在公开 HISTAI 数据集上应用 Polysome，生成 HISTAI-Instruct 指令调优数据集（覆盖 24,259 张切片、超 110 万指令-响应对）；3. 用该数据集训练视觉-语言模型 ANTONI-α，支持对整张切片的视觉问答（VQA）。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种像素级映射预处理方法，通过打断图像像素值分布来破坏探测器常利用的非关键语义模式，从而提升AI生成图像检测器对未见过生成模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成图像检测器存在泛化能力不足的问题，主要因为它们过度拟合特定生成模型的语义线索，而非学习图像生成过程中真正通用的生成痕迹，导致对未见过生成模型的检测性能下降。

Method: 作者提出一种简单有效的像素级映射预处理步骤：通过修改图像像素值分布来破坏探测器常利用的脆弱、非本质的语义模式，迫使探测器关注图像生成过程中更基础、更可泛化的高频痕迹。

Result: 在GAN和diffusion等生成模型上的全面实验表明，该方法显著提升了最先进检测器的跨生成器性能。进一步的分析验证了假设：破坏语义线索是实现泛化的关键。

Conclusion: 像素级映射预处理是增强AI生成图像检测器泛化能力的有效方法，通过干扰非关键语义线索，让探测器学习更通用的生成痕迹，从而在面对未见过生成模型时保持良好性能。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative technologies necessitates reliable methods for detecting AI-generated images. A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了情感图像过滤（AIF）任务，通过文本中视觉抽象的情感生成视觉具象的图像，创建情感吸引力的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体用户常通过图文结合表达情感，但现有方法难以将文本中的抽象情感有效转化为视觉具象的图像。为填补这一空白，作者提出AIF任务，旨在生成既保持内容一致性又具有情感保真度的图像。

Method: 首先引入AIF数据集和模型框架；然后提出AIF-B，基于多模态Transformer架构的初步尝试；接着提出AIF-D，作为AIF-B的扩展，利用预训练大规模扩散模型的生成先验实现更深层的情感反映。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，AIF模型在内容一致性和情感保真度上相比现有技术取得优越性能；大规模用户研究证实AIF模型能更有效地唤起特定情感。

Conclusion: 论文全面讨论了AIF模型的价值和潜力，证明其在生成情感丰富图像方面的有效性，为多媒体情感表达提供了新思路。

Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to express emotions by posting text with accompanying images. In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.

Motivation: 现有扩散基视频生成技术在可控视频编辑上取得进展，但在实现真实视频对象插入方面仍面临挑战，主要原因是4D场景理解有限以及对遮挡和光照效果处理不足。

Method: 方法包含4D感知掩码生成模块（重建场景几何、跨帧传播物体放置保持时间一致性和遮挡一致性）和扩散基视频生成模型扩展（联合合成插入物体及其周围局部变化如光照和阴影）。训练使用ROSE++合成数据集。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在多样化真实场景中产生几何合理和视觉一致的对象插入效果，显著优于现有研究和商业模型。

Conclusion: InsertAnywhere框架通过结合4D场景理解和局部外观合成，实现了高质量的几何一致且外观保真的视频对象插入。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

Abstract: Accurate flood detection from visual data is a critical step toward improving disaster response and risk assessment, yet datasets for flood segmentation remain scarce due to the challenges of collecting and annotating large-scale imagery. Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

Motivation: 现有的鲁棒性多模态大语言模型主要依赖隐式训练/适配，仅关注视觉编码器的泛化，存在可解释性有限和孤立优化的缺陷。

Method: Robust-R1框架包含监督微调用于建立退化感知推理基础，奖励驱动对齐用于准确感知退化参数，以及根据退化强度动态调整的推理深度扩展。

Conclusion: Robust-R1通过结构化推理链显式建模视觉退化，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在极端真实世界视觉退化下的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.

Abstract: We open-source \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B} and its quantized variant \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B-GGUF}, a pair of home-centric vision-language models that achieve strong performance on both home-scenario understanding and general multimodal reasoning. Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently. Our analysis shows that targeted home-scenario training not only enhances activity and gesture understanding, but also improves text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks. Model checkpoints, quantized GGUF weights, and our home-scenario evaluation toolkit are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco}{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco} to support research and deployment in real-world smart-home applications.

Abstract: With 3D data rapidly emerging as an important form of multimedia information, 3D human mesh recovery technology has also advanced accordingly. However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios. The code and model for ClothHMR are available at: \url{https://github.com/starVisionTeam/ClothHMR}.

Abstract: LangDriveCTRL is a natural-language-controllable framework for editing real-world driving videos to synthesize diverse traffic scenarios. It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

Method: 使用了约5000张不同肿瘤类型、采集时间和中心的FLAIR图像，训练基于Attention U‑Net架构的统一FLAIR高信号分割模型，并与数据集特定模型进行性能比较。

Result: 统一模型在不同肿瘤类型和时序上均取得良好分割效果：术前脑膜瘤平均Dice得分88.65%，术前转移瘤80.08%，术前胶质瘤90.92%，术后胶质瘤84.60%（BraTS数据），术前低级别胶质瘤84.47%，术后低级别胶质瘤61.27%。模型性能与数据集特定模型相当，并具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 统一FLAIR分割模型在多种肿瘤类型和采集时间点上表现出色，泛化能力强，已集成到开源软件Raidionics中，便于临床部署使用。

Abstract: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of brain tumors. Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting. The model is integrated into Raidionics, an open-source software for CNS tumor analysis.

Abstract: Unmanned surface vehicles can encounter a number of varied visual circumstances during operation, some of which can be very difficult to interpret. While most cases can be solved only using color camera images, some weather and lighting conditions require additional information. To expand the available maritime data, we present a novel multimodal maritime dataset MULTIAQUA (Multimodal Aquatic Dataset). Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness. Our approach allows for training a robust deep neural network only using daytime images, thus significantly simplifying data acquisition, annotation, and the training process.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene generation produce visually appealing output, but current representations hinder artists' workflows that require modifiable 3D textured mesh scenes for visual effects and game development. Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.
  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.

Abstract: Robust mammography registration is essential for clinical applications like tracking disease progression and monitoring longitudinal changes in breast tissue. However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is critical in diagnosis and treatment planning for the disease. Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在创意生成方面进步显著，但缺乏对场景照明的精确控制，而照明是内容设计师操控图像氛围和美学效果的关键因素

Method: 1)沿普朗克轨迹进行基于物理的照明增强以创建标准照明下的微调变体；2)使用冻结ControlNet进行边缘引导的提示解耦，确保提示专注于照明而非结构；3)掩码重建损失聚焦前景物体学习，同时允许背景进行上下文自适应（上下文光照适应）

Result: 与现有T2I定制化方法相比，LumiCtrl实现了显著更好的照明保真度、美学质量和场景一致性，用户偏好研究进一步证实了用户对LumiCtrl输出的强烈偏好

Conclusion: LumiCtrl方法通过学习给定单张物体图像的照明提示，为文本到图像模型提供对场景照明的精确控制，提升了生成的照明质量和场景适应性

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable progress in creative image generation, yet they still lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is a crucial factor for content designers aiming to manipulate the mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics of generated images. In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: MMLANDMARKS是一个多模态地理空间数据集，包含美国18,557个地标的航拍图像、地面图像、文本和坐标信息，支持多种地理空间任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地理空间数据集在多模态覆盖方面有限，无法在统一框架中整合所有相关模态，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建了MMLANDMARKS数据集，包含197K高分辨率航拍图像、329K地面图像、文本信息和地理坐标，所有模态间具有一一对应关系。采用简单的CLIP-inspired基线模型进行实验。

Result: 在跨视角地面到卫星检索、地面和卫星地理定位、文本到图像、文本到GPS检索等任务中，展现了广泛的泛化能力和与现成基础模型及专业SOTA模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 多模态数据集对于实现广泛的地理空间理解是必要的，MMLANDMARKS为这一领域提供了全面的基准。

Abstract: Geo-spatial analysis of our world benefits from a multimodal approach, as every single geographic location can be described in numerous ways (images from various viewpoints, textual descriptions, and geographic coordinates). Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了GroundingME基准，系统评估多模态大语言模型在视觉定位任务中的真实能力，揭示当前模型在复杂场景下的显著性能差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能捕捉真实世界复杂性，无法确定MLLMs是真正理解视觉语言关联还是仅仅在简化数据集上进行模式匹配

Method: 创建包含1005个挑战性示例的GroundingME基准，涵盖四个关键维度：区分性、空间理解、有限可视性和拒绝能力；评估25个最先进的MLLMs，并探索两种改进策略

Result: 最佳模型仅达到45.1%准确率，大多数模型在拒绝任务上得分为0%；测试时缩放策略将复杂定位性能提升2.9%，数据混合训练将拒绝准确率从0%提升至27.9%

Conclusion: GroundingME既是揭示当前MLLMs局限性的诊断工具，也是实现人类水平视觉定位的路线图

Abstract: Visual grounding, localizing objects from natural language descriptions, represents a critical bridge between language and vision understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.
  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).
  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.
  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong potential for solving inverse problems such as single-image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution observation using a pretrained unconditional prior. Conditioning methods, including Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG), can substantially improve reconstruction quality, but they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning. In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to identify the dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models, and show that the conditioning step size has a significantly greater impact than the diffusion step count, with step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielding the best overall performance in our experiments.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视图合成损失来回归3D高斯参数，但这种自监督方式无法保证几何一致性，难以获得有意义的3D场景表示

Method: 提出G3Splat框架，在自监督的泛化高斯建模中加强几何先验约束，确保几何一致性

Result: 在RE10K数据集上实现几何一致性重建、相对姿态估计和新视角合成的SOTA性能，在ScanNet上展示强大的零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 仅靠视图合成损失不足以获得几何一致的3D高斯建模，通过几何先验约束可以显著提升几何重建质量和姿态估计精度

Abstract: 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an effective scene representation for real-time splatting and accurate novel-view synthesis, motivating several works to adapt multi-view structure prediction networks to regress per-pixel 3D Gaussians from images. However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation. Code and pretrained models are released on our project page (https://m80hz.github.io/g3splat/).

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods. Codebase is available at GitHub.

Abstract: Virtual furniture synthesis, which seamlessly integrates reference objects into indoor scenes while maintaining geometric coherence and visual realism, holds substantial promise for home design and e-commerce applications. However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

Abstract: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures dynamic scene sequences through a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot, fundamentally relying on optical modulation for hardware compression and the corresponding software reconstruction. While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Benchmarking competitions are central to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, defining performance standards and shaping methodological progress. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance.

Abstract: We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 评估开源视觉语言模型LLaVA-1.5-13B和Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2在PGD对抗攻击下的稳健性，发现Llama 3.2 Vision在VQA基准准确率较低的情况下，对抗攻击下的性能下降更小，这表明稳健性与标准基准表现不一定直接相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习复杂度的提升，理解AI系统的决策过程变得困难，而攻击者可能通过添加未见元素来干扰模型的物体识别能力。本文旨在研究当前开源视觉语言模型在视觉对抗攻击下的稳健性。

Method: 使用针对视觉输入的PGD对抗攻击（非定向），在VQA v2数据集子集上对LLaVA-1.5-13B和Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2模型进行攻击。用标准VQA准确率量化攻击效果，计算攻击后的性能下降（精度降低），并比较两个模型的稳健性表现。

Result: Llama 3.2 Vision虽然基线准确率较低，但在较高扰动水平下（面临更强攻击时），性能下降相对于LLaVA更小。结果表明，即使是Meta的Llama 3.2 Vision等当代视觉语言模型，视觉模态仍然是一个可行的攻击路径。

Conclusion: 对视觉输入的对抗攻击确实能显著降低开源视觉语言模型的性能。对抗攻击稳健性与标准基准性能并不直接强相关，这可能受模型架构和训练方式等因素的影响。

Abstract: With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for multi-class segmentation of medical images are widely used today. Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.
  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.
  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.
  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses. This makes it a universal approach, which is especially important for architectures that involve separate segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLM时需测试其视觉内容的独立分析能力，现有基于视觉提示的基准对标记设计细节过于敏感，影响模型排名可靠性。

Method: 在9个常用VLM上测试两种视觉提示任务，分析标记设计和数据集规模影响，创建VPBench基准含16种视觉标记变体。

Result: 视觉标记颜色、大小等细节显著影响模型性能和排名，甚至可将弱模型提升至强模型水平；JPEG压缩等级等推断选择也有影响。

Conclusion: 视觉提示基准对实现细节高度敏感，需更稳定基准；VPBench提供更全面的视觉提示评估工具。

Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants. VPBench and additional analysis tools are released at https://lisadunlap.github.io/vpbench/.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead. Code will be available at https://github.com/Uddd821/StereoMV2D.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and the interactions between them. Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

Conclusion: FlexAvatar通过灵活的重建框架和轻量级解码器，实现了从单张或稀疏图像中重建高保真、具有详细动态形变的3D头部化身，为3D动画头像创作提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We present FlexAvatar, a flexible large reconstruction model for high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformation from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels. It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation.

Abstract: The advancement of safety-critical research in driving behavior in ADAS-equipped vehicles require real-world datasets that not only include diverse traffic scenarios but also capture high-risk edge cases such as near-miss events and system failures. However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types. (3) We establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2 and InternVL2.5 HiCo R16), showing that SAVeD's detailed annotations significantly enhance model performance through domain adaptation in complex near-miss scenarios.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to the widespread availability of highly realistic synthetic media, increasing the difficulty of reliable deepfake detection. A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.

Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.

TL;DR: 提出了UrbanDIFF，一种基于去噪扩散的空间模型，用于重建云污染的城区地表温度影像；该方法利用静态城市结构信息，并通过监督像素引导的推理步骤确保与云隙像素的一致性，在高达85%云覆盖下仍能保持较好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地表温度重构建方法依赖多时相或多传感器数据，在持续云覆盖下可能存在数据缺失或不可靠；而传统空间插值方法在大型连续云隙区性能下降，深度学习模型在高缺失率下性能衰减快，需要更稳健的空间重建方法。

Method: 采用纯空间去噪扩散模型，条件信息包括建成区表面数据和数字高程模型等静态城市结构信息，并在推理过程中通过监督像素引导的细调步骤强制保持与云隙像素的一致性。

Result: 在7个美国大都市区的MODIS Terra LST数据上训练和评估，使用20%-85%云覆盖率合成云掩码；结果表明UrbanDIFF始终优于插值基线，尤其在密集云覆盖下表现更好，在85%云覆盖率时SSIM为0.89、RMSE为1.2K、R2为0.84，且随云密度增加性能衰减更慢。

Conclusion: UrbanDIFF空间去噪扩散模型为云污染城市地表温度影像重建提供了稳健的解决方案，在无需多时相数据的情况下，有效保持了与观测像素的一致性，在高云覆盖条件下仍表现出色。

Abstract: Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) products are central to surface urban heat island (SUHI) monitoring due to their consistent grid-based coverage over large metropolitan regions. However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.
  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.
  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

Abstract: While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.
  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures stem from domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE exposes these bottlenecks and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular analysis with high specificity, making it a powerful tool for biomedical diagnostics. However, its application to biological tissues is challenged by inherently weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background, which significantly degrade signal quality. In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as a validation case study. Our results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed learning to improve spectral quality and enable faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.

To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重新训练即可将ViT基础模型转化为自解释模型的新方法——关键点计数分类器（KCC）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自解释模型设计方法需要复杂的训练过程和特定架构，使得其在通用基础模型时代变得不切实际。需要为ViT基础模型提供透明性和可靠性的新方法。

Method: 基于ViT能够自动识别图像间匹配关键点的能力，开发了一种将任何训练好的ViT模型转化为关键点计数分类器的简单方法。该方法使用关键的匹配点计数作为可解释的决策过程，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 广泛的评估表明，KCC方法相比现有基线显著改善了人机通信效果。

Conclusion: KCC是实现ViT基础模型更加透明和可靠的重要一步，为构建实用的自解释模型提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Current approaches for designing self-explainable models (SEMs) require complicated training procedures and specific architectures which makes them impractical. With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.

Abstract: Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建创建的数字孪生大多是静态的，仅限于导航和视角合成，缺乏具身交互性。为了弥合这一差距，需要建模灵巧人类动作如何引起3D场景的动态变化

Method: 基于场景-动作条件视频扩散框架，通过静态场景渲染和第一人称手部运动序列生成时间一致的视频。结合合成第一人称交互数据（提供完全对齐的监督）和固定摄像头真实视频（提供多样化的真实物体动态）进行训练

Result: DWM能够实现真实且物理合理的交互（如抓取、打开和移动物体），同时保持摄像头和场景一致性

Conclusion: 该框架是基于视频扩散的交互式数字孪生的第一步，能够从第一人称动作进行具身模拟

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.
  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.
  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.

TL;DR: 提出一个新的框架，将识别编码器的特征适配用于生成任务，通过引入语义-像素重建目标来压缩语义信息和细节，构建紧凑表示，在文本生成图像和图像编辑上都获得优良性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前隐扩散模型多在低维VAE隐空间中操作，主要针对像素级重建优化；为了统一视觉生成与理解，近期趋势是采用识别编码器的高维特征作为生成隐变量，但该方法存在两大障碍：（1）识别特征空间缺少紧凑正则化，导致扩散模型容易产生偏离流形的隐变量，造成目标结构失真；（2）编码器的像素级重建能力较弱，限制了生成器学习准确细粒度的几何与纹理。

Method: 提出系统性框架来将面向理解的编码器特征适配于生成任务。引入语义-像素重建目标来正则化隐空间，从而将语义信息和细粒度细节压缩成高度紧凑的表示（96通道，空间下采样16x16）。利用该表示，设计了统一的文本到图像生成（T2I）模型和图像编辑模型。

Result: 该方法在多个特征空间中评测，取得了最优的图像重建效果、更快的收敛速度，并且在T2I和图像编辑任务上都有显著的性能提升。证明识别编码器可以有效适配为鲁棒的生成组件。

Conclusion: 通过正则化隐空间并综合保留语义信息和细粒度细节，可以将理解型编码器特征成功地转换为高性能的生成表示，从而实现统一的视觉生成与理解。

Abstract: Modern Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) typically operate in low-level Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent spaces that are primarily optimized for pixel-level reconstruction. To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become primary sources of health information for millions, their accuracy in women's health remains critically unexamined. We introduce the Women's Health Benchmark (WHB), the first benchmark evaluating LLM performance specifically in women's health. Our benchmark comprises 96 rigorously validated model stumps covering five medical specialties (obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, primary care, oncology, and neurology), three query types (patient query, clinician query, and evidence/policy query), and eight error types (dosage/medication errors, missing critical information, outdated guidelines/treatment recommendations, incorrect treatment advice, incorrect factual information, missing/incorrect differential diagnosis, missed urgency, and inappropriate recommendations). We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art LLMs and revealed alarming gaps: current models show approximately 60\% failure rates on the women's health benchmark, with performance varying dramatically across specialties and error types. Notably, models universally struggle with "missed urgency" indicators, while newer models like GPT-5 show significant improvements in avoiding inappropriate recommendations. Our findings underscore that AI chatbots are not yet fully able of providing reliable advice in women's health.

TL;DR: Struct-SQL框架通过结构化CoT蒸馏，使小型语言模型在Text-to-SQL任务上性能显著提升（+8.1%），减少句法错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级Text-to-SQL系统面临成本、安全和性能的三难选择：昂贵的大型语言模型（LLM）与性能低下的小型语言模型（SLM）之间缺乏理想方案。现有提升SLM的方法依赖非结构化思维链（CoT）存在模糊性，而结构化推理可提供更清晰的教学信号。

Method: 提出Struct-SQL知识蒸馏框架，用查询执行计划作为结构化推理蓝图，训练SLM模仿大型LLM的推理过程，实现结构化思维链蒸馏。

Result: 结构化CoT蒸馏的SLM相比非结构化CoT基线绝对提升8.1%，错误分析显示句法错误显著减少。

Conclusion: 使用结构化逻辑蓝图教导模型推理，有助于提升SLM生成SQL的可靠性，为企业级Text-to-SQL部署提供成本效益更高的解决方案。

Abstract: Deploying accurate Text-to-SQL systems at the enterprise level faces a difficult trilemma involving cost, security and performance. Current solutions force enterprises to choose between expensive, proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) and low-performing Small Language Models (SLMs). Efforts to improve SLMs often rely on distilling reasoning from large LLMs using unstructured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces, a process that remains inherently ambiguous. Instead, we hypothesize that a formal, structured reasoning representation provides a clearer, more reliable teaching signal, as the Text-to-SQL task requires explicit and precise logical steps. To evaluate this hypothesis, we propose Struct-SQL, a novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework that trains an SLM to emulate a powerful large LLM. Consequently, we adopt a query execution plan as a formal blueprint to derive this structured reasoning. Our SLM, distilled with structured CoT, achieves an absolute improvement of 8.1% over an unstructured CoT distillation baseline. A detailed error analysis reveals that a key factor in this gain is a marked reduction in syntactic errors. This demonstrates that teaching a model to reason using a structured logical blueprint is beneficial for reliable SQL generation in SLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in non-autoregressive text generation in the context of general language modeling. Unlike the well-established autoregressive language modeling paradigm, which has a plethora of standard training and inference libraries, implementations of non-autoregressive language modeling have largely been bespoke making it difficult to perform systematic comparisons of different methods. Moreover, each non-autoregressive language model typically requires it own data collation, loss, and prediction logic, making it challenging to reuse common components. In this work, we present the XLM python package, which is designed to make implementing small non-autoregressive language models faster with a secondary goal of providing a suite of small pre-trained models (through a companion xlm-models package) that can be used by the research community. The code is available at https://github.com/dhruvdcoder/xlm-core.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练数据常来自互联网爬取，存在版权与授权合规问题。需要技术手段让数据所有者能证明其数据被用于模型训练以维护版权和许可协议。

Method: 通过使用LLM对文本进行重述，并根据评分模型对每个重述文本评分。选择与原文本评分最接近的重述，避免引入分布偏移。检测时比较目标模型与评分模型的token概率差异。

Result: 实验显示SPECTRA在检测训练数据vs非训练数据时，p值差距超过9个数量级，优于所有基线方法。水印能在大规模LLM训练中保持可检测性。

Conclusion: SPECTRA为数据所有者提供了一种可扩展、可在数据发布前部署的数字水印方案，即使训练数据仅占极小比例，也能有效检测模型是否使用其数据训练。

Abstract: Training data detection is critical for enforcing copyright and data licensing, as Large Language Models (LLM) are trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet. We present SPECTRA, a watermarking approach that makes training data reliably detectable even when it comprises less than 0.001% of the training corpus. SPECTRA works by paraphrasing text using an LLM and assigning a score based on how likely each paraphrase is, according to a separate scoring model. A paraphrase is chosen so that its score closely matches that of the original text, to avoid introducing any distribution shifts. To test whether a suspect model has been trained on the watermarked data, we compare its token probabilities against those of the scoring model. We demonstrate that SPECTRA achieves a consistent p-value gap of over nine orders of magnitude when detecting data used for training versus data not used for training, which is greater than all baselines tested. SPECTRA equips data owners with a scalable, deploy-before-release watermark that survives even large-scale LLM training.

TL;DR: 论文提出了对话话题分割的新评估框架，强调将边界密度和片段连贯性作为主要标准，并指出传统精确匹配F1指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话话题分割对摘要、检索、记忆管理和对话连续性很重要，但当前评估方法仍以严格边界匹配和F1指标为主，而大型语言模型需要在有限上下文窗口中管理对话历史，不恰当的分割会影响效率和连贯性。

Method: 引入基于边界密度、片段连贯性和窗口容忍F1的评估目标；在八个不同对话数据集上评估多种结构不同的分割策略；通过分离边界评分和边界选择来操作化话题分割的粒度选择概念。

Result: 研究发现跨数据集的性能差异主要由标注粒度不匹配和稀疏边界标签引起，而非模型质量；观察到许多分割方法虽然显示高片段连贯性但存在过度分割，导致基于稀疏标签的F1分数误导性偏低。

Conclusion: 话题分割应视为选择适当粒度的过程，而非预测单一正确边界集；需要重新思考评估方法以避免评估伪影，强调边界密度和连贯性作为主要标准。

Abstract: Dialogue topic segmentation supports summarization, retrieval, memory management, and conversational continuity. Despite decades of prior work, evaluation practice in dialogue topic segmentation remains dominated by strict boundary matching and F1-based metrics, even as modern LLM-based conversational systems increasingly rely on segmentation to manage conversation history beyond the model's fixed context window, where unstructured context accumulation degrades efficiency and coherence.
  This paper introduces an evaluation objective for dialogue topic segmentation that treats boundary density and segment coherence as primary criteria, alongside window-tolerant F1 (W-F1). Through extensive cross-dataset empirical evaluation, we show that reported performance differences across dialogue segmentation benchmarks are driven not by model quality, but by annotation granularity mismatches and sparse boundary labels. This indicates that many reported improvements arise from evaluation artifacts rather than improved boundary detection.
  We evaluated multiple, structurally distinct dialogue segmentation strategies across eight dialogue datasets spanning task-oriented, open-domain, meeting-style, and synthetic interactions. Across these settings, we observe high segment coherence combined with extreme oversegmentation relative to sparse labels, producing misleadingly low exact-match F1 scores. We show that topic segmentation is best understood as selecting an appropriate granularity rather than predicting a single correct boundary set. We operationalize this view by explicitly separating boundary scoring from boundary selection.

Conclusion: 高亮引导摘要方法能够更好地保留重要细节，生成更准确、更有洞察力的跨领域摘要，两阶段流水线在长文档摘要任务中表现更优

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for long context summarisation, highlight-guided generation, that leverages sentence-level information as a content plan to improve the traceability and faithfulness of generated summaries. Our framework applies self-planning methods to identify important content and then generates a summary conditioned on the plan. We explore both an end-to-end and two-stage variants of the approach, finding that the two-stage pipeline performs better on long and information-dense documents. Experiments on long-form summarisation datasets demonstrate that our method consistently improves factual consistency while preserving relevance and overall quality. On GovReport, our best approach has improved ROUGE-L by 4.1 points and achieves about 35% gains in SummaC scores. Qualitative analysis shows that highlight-guided summarisation helps preserve important details, leading to more accurate and insightful summaries across domains.

Abstract: Humans understand long and complex texts by relying on a holistic semantic representation of the content. This global view helps organize prior knowledge, interpret new information, and integrate evidence dispersed across a document, as revealed by the Mindscape-Aware Capability of humans in psychology. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems lack such guidance and therefore struggle with long-context tasks. In this paper, we propose Mindscape-Aware RAG (MiA-RAG), the first approach that equips LLM-based RAG systems with explicit global context awareness. MiA-RAG builds a mindscape through hierarchical summarization and conditions both retrieval and generation on this global semantic representation. This enables the retriever to form enriched query embeddings and the generator to reason over retrieved evidence within a coherent global context. We evaluate MiA-RAG across diverse long-context and bilingual benchmarks for evidence-based understanding and global sense-making. It consistently surpasses baselines, and further analysis shows that it aligns local details with a coherent global representation, enabling more human-like long-context retrieval and reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个结合多重假设和噪声感知建模的鲁棒性ASR纠错框架，专为低资源语言波斯语设计，通过引入误差级别噪声（ELN）表示噪声引起的语言学扭曲，提升嘈杂环境下的语音识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音识别系统在嘈杂环境中性能显著下降，对于波斯语等低资源语言尤为严重。现有最先进模型也难以在不同信噪比下保持准确率。

Method: 1. 使用修改后的Whisper-large解码器生成5个最佳假设；
2. 引入误差级别噪声（ELN）表示语义和词元级别的假设分歧；
3. 评估三种模型：基础LLaMA-2-7B、仅文本微调模型、集成句子和词级ELN嵌入的噪声条件模型。

Result: ELN条件模型在混合噪声测试集上显著降低词错误率：从基准的31.10%（原始Whisper）降至24.84%，优于仅文本微调基线的30.79%。原始LLaMA-2-7B模型则将WER提升至64.58%。

Conclusion: 结合多重假设和噪声感知嵌入的方法能有效提升嘈杂环境下波斯语ASR的鲁棒性，证实了噪声条件建模对处理低资源语言语音识别的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems suffer significant performance degradation in noisy environments, a challenge that is especially severe for low-resource languages such as Persian. Even state-of-the-art models such as Whisper struggle to maintain accuracy under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This study presents a robust noise-sensitive ASR error correction framework that combines multiple hypotheses and noise-aware modeling. Using noisy Persian speech, we generate 5-best hypotheses from a modified Whisper-large decoder. Error Level Noise (ELN) is introduced as a representation that captures semantic- and token-level disagreement across hypotheses, quantifying the linguistic distortions caused by noise. ELN thus provides a direct measure of noise-induced uncertainty, enabling the LLM to reason about the reliability of each hypothesis during correction. Three models are evaluated: (1) a base LLaMA-2-7B model without fine-tuning, (2) a fine-tuned variant trained on text-only hypotheses, and (3) a noise-conditioned model integrating ELN embeddings at both sentence and word levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELN-conditioned model achieves substantial reductions in Word Error Rate (WER). Specifically, on the challenging Mixed Noise test set, the proposed Fine-tuned + ELN (Ours) model reduces the WER from a baseline of 31.10\% (Raw Whisper) to 24.84\%, significantly surpassing the Fine-tuned (No ELN) text-only baseline of 30.79\%, whereas the original LLaMA-2-7B model increased the WER to 64.58\%, demonstrating that it is unable to correct Persian errors on its own. This confirms the effectiveness of combining multiple hypotheses with noise-aware embeddings for robust Persian ASR in noisy real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models have recently made significant progress to generate rigorous mathematical proofs. In contrast, utilizing LLMs for theorem proving in formal languages (such as Lean) remains challenging and computationally expensive, particularly when addressing problems at the undergraduate level and beyond. In this work, we present \textbf{Seed-Prover 1.5}, a formal theorem-proving model trained via large-scale agentic reinforcement learning, alongside an efficient test-time scaling (TTS) workflow. Through extensive interactions with Lean and other tools, the model continuously accumulates experience during the RL process, substantially enhancing the capability and efficiency of formal theorem proving. Furthermore, leveraging recent advancements in natural language proving, our TTS workflow efficiently bridges the gap between natural and formal languages. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Seed-Prover 1.5 achieves superior performance with a smaller compute budget. It solves \textbf{88\% of PutnamBench} (undergraduate-level), \textbf{80\% of Fate-H} (graduate-level), and \textbf{33\% of Fate-X} (PhD-level) problems. Notably, using our system, we solved \textbf{11 out of 12 problems} from Putnam 2025 within 9 hours. Our findings suggest that scaling learning from experience, driven by high-quality formal feedback, holds immense potential for the future of formal mathematical reasoning.

Much research and advancements have already been conducted on objective question generation; however, automated subjective question generation and answer evaluation are still in progress. An automated system to generate subjective questions and evaluate the answers can help teachers assess student work and enhance the student's learning experience by allowing them to self-assess their understanding after reading an article or a chapter of a book.

Motivation: 针对多语言、低资源环境下大型语言模型的高效适应问题，需要在有限计算预算下达到高准确性、良好的校准能力以及跨语言平衡。现有方法在资源受限场景下往往难以兼顾这些指标，且对轻量级正交变体不够稳健。

Method: 1）核心算法：结合梯度对齐的低秩更新与通过层间混合的结构正交变换，在选定的子层引入单元约束以稳定深层优化；2）数据治理：采用轻量级无标签数据管理步骤，包括语言识别、近重复删除和质量过滤；3）整体框架：混合微调与数据治理相结合，针对多语言低资源适应进行设计。

Result: 1）在XNLI和FLORES数据集上，混合方法相对于强PEFT基线实现了一致的性能提升，同时保持了方向平衡并改善了概率校准（表II和表III）；2）对轻量级正交变体更具韧性（表IV）；3）简单治理步骤能带来叠加效益（表V）；4）训练足迹测量显示适度的开销和有利的成本-质量边界（表VI和图2）。

Conclusion: 混合和单元的PEFT与实用的数据治理相结合，为资源高效的多语言适应提供了一个稳定且易于实现的途径。

Abstract: We present a governance-aware hybrid fine-tuning framework for multilingual, low-resource adaptation of large language models. The core algorithm combines gradient-aligned low-rank updates with structured orthogonal transformations through layer-wise mixing and introduces unitary constraints in selected sub-layers to stabilize deep optimization. In tandem with lightweight, label-free data governance steps, including language identification, near-duplicate removal, and quality filtering, the framework targets accuracy, calibration, and cross-language parity under tight compute budgets. Across XNLI and FLORES, the hybrid approach delivers consistent gains over strong PEFT baselines while maintaining directional balance and improving probability calibration, as shown in Tables II and III. It is more resilient to lightweight orthographic variants, as shown in Table IV, and benefits additively from simple governance steps, as shown in Table V. Training footprint measurements indicate modest overhead and a favorable cost-quality frontier, as shown in Table VI and Figure 2. Together, these results show that hybrid and unitary PEFT provide a stable and accessible path to resource-efficient multilingual adaptation when paired with practical data governance.

Abstract: Understanding architectural differences in language models is challenging, especially at academic-scale pretraining (e.g., 1.3B parameters, 100B tokens), where results are often dominated by noise and randomness. To overcome this, we introduce controlled synthetic pretraining tasks that isolate and evaluate core model capabilities. Within this framework, we discover CANON LAYERS: lightweight architectural components -- named after the musical term "canon" -- that promote horizontal information flow across neighboring tokens. Canon layers compute weighted sums of nearby token representations and integrate seamlessly into Transformers, linear attention, state-space models, or any sequence architecture.
  We present 12 key results. This includes how Canon layers enhance reasoning depth (e.g., by $2\times$), reasoning breadth, knowledge manipulation, etc. They lift weak architectures like NoPE to match RoPE, and linear attention to rival SOTA linear models like Mamba2/GDN -- validated both through synthetic tasks and real-world academic-scale pretraining. This synthetic playground offers an economical, principled path to isolate core model capabilities often obscured at academic scales. Equipped with infinite high-quality data, it may even PREDICT how future architectures will behave as training pipelines improve -- e.g., through better data curation or RL-based post-training -- unlocking deeper reasoning and hierarchical inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了CulturalToM-VQA数据集，这是一个包含5095个问题的评估基准，旨在通过视觉问答探究跨文化背景下的心理理论推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在教育任务中应用广泛，但其跨文化心理理论推理能力尚未得到充分探索，需要超越西方中心基准的系统评估。

Method: 采用人类专家与视觉语言模型结合的流水线：专家收集丰富文化图像，VLM生成结构化心理理论场景描述，然后转化为涵盖六类心理理论任务和四个复杂度等级的问题-答案对。

Result: 开发出CulturalToM-VQA数据集，涵盖仪式、服饰、姿态和人际关系等文化线索，支持对心理状态归因、错误信念推理、非字面交际、社会规范违反、视角协调和多主体推理等方面的系统评估。

Conclusion: CulturalToM-VQA为评估人工智能系统的跨文化心理理论推理能力提供了新的基准，有助于推进社会智能研究。

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to attribute beliefs, desires, and emotions to others -- is fundamental for human social intelligence, yet remains a major challenge for artificial agents. Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in socially grounded tasks, but their capacity for cross-cultural ToM reasoning is largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce CulturalToM-VQA, a new evaluation benchmark containing 5095 questions designed to probe ToM reasoning across diverse cultural contexts through visual question answering. The dataset captures culturally grounded cues such as rituals, attire, gestures, and interpersonal dynamics, enabling systematic evaluation of ToM reasoning beyond Western-centric benchmarks. Our dataset is built through a VLM-assisted human-in-the-loop pipeline, where human experts first curate culturally rich images across traditions, rituals, and social interactions; a VLM then assist in generating structured ToM-focused scene descriptions, which are refined into question-answer pairs spanning a taxonomy of six ToM tasks and four graded complexity levels. The resulting dataset covers diverse theory of mind facets such as mental state attribution, false belief reasoning, non-literal communication, social norm violations, perspective coordination, and multi-agent reasoning.

Motivation: 传统集成方法多依赖同质架构，无法充分利用模型间的误差多样性；大型语言模型参数冗余且计算成本高，而精心设计的小模型集成在特定任务上可能表现更优。

Method: 集成BERT、RoBERTa、DistilBERT、DeBERTa、ELECTRA等异构小Transformer模型，保持参数低收敛以维护误差多样性；提出双重加权投票机制，结合全局可信度（验证F1）和局部置信度（实例级概率）动态加权模型贡献。

Result: 在DAIR-AI数据集上取得93.5%的宏F1分数，超越现有SOTA基准，显著优于Falcon、Mistral、Qwen、Phi等大型LLM（即使经过LoRA适配）；仅595M总参数，比7B参数模型更高效鲁棒。

Conclusion: 精心设计的异构小模型集成在情感检测等特定NLP任务上可以超越参数量大一个数量级的大型语言模型，证明参数效率与架构多样性结合的重要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a confidence-weighted, credibility-aware ensemble framework for text-based emotion detection, inspired by Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT). Unlike conventional ensembles that often rely on homogeneous architectures, our approach combines architecturally diverse small transformer-based large language models (sLLMs) - BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, DeBERTa, and ELECTRA, each fully fine-tuned for emotion classification. To preserve error diversity, we minimize parameter convergence while taking advantage of the unique biases of each model. A dual-weighted voting mechanism integrates both global credibility (validation F1 score) and local confidence (instance-level probability) to dynamically weight model contributions. Experiments on the DAIR-AI dataset demonstrate that our credibility-confidence ensemble achieves a macro F1 score of 93.5 percent, surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks and significantly outperforming large-scale LLMs, including Falcon, Mistral, Qwen, and Phi, even after task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). With only 595M parameters in total, our small LLMs ensemble proves more parameter-efficient and robust than models up to 7B parameters, establishing that carefully designed ensembles of small, fine-tuned models can outperform much larger LLMs in specialized natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as emotion detection.

Conclusion: ShareChat为研究社区提供了一个重要且及时的资源，用于理解真实环境中用户与LLM聊天机器人的交互，填补了现有数据集中缺失的平台特性和界面背景信息。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into distinct platforms with unique interface designs and capabilities, existing public datasets treat models as generic text generators, stripping away the interface context that actively shapes user interaction. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale, cross-platform corpus comprising 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns collected from publicly shared URLs across five major platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit distinct and consistent personalities that greatly impact trust and engagement. While this means that personality frameworks would be highly valuable tools to characterize and control LLMs' behavior, current approaches remain either costly (post-training) or brittle (prompt engineering). Probing and steering via linear directions has recently emerged as a cheap and efficient alternative. In this paper, we investigate whether linear directions aligned with the Big Five personality traits can be used for probing and steering model behavior. Using Llama 3.3 70B, we generate descriptions of 406 fictional characters and their Big Five trait scores. We then prompt the model with these descriptions and questions from the Alpaca questionnaire, allowing us to sample hidden activations that vary along personality traits in known, quantifiable ways. Using linear regression, we learn a set of per-layer directions in activation space, and test their effectiveness for probing and steering model behavior. Our results suggest that linear directions aligned with trait-scores are effective probes for personality detection, while their steering capabilities strongly depend on context, producing reliable effects in forced-choice tasks but limited influence in open-ended generation or when additional context is present in the prompt.

Abstract: Streaming Speech-to-Text Translation (StreamST) requires producing translations concurrently with incoming speech, imposing strict latency constraints and demanding models that balance partial-information decision-making with high translation quality. Research efforts on the topic have so far relied on the SimulEval repository, which is no longer maintained and does not support systems that revise their outputs. In addition, it has been designed for simulating the processing of short segments, rather than long-form audio streams, and it does not provide an easy method to showcase systems in a demo. As a solution, we introduce simulstream, the first open-source framework dedicated to unified evaluation and demonstration of StreamST systems. Designed for long-form speech processing, it supports not only incremental decoding approaches, but also re-translation methods, enabling for their comparison within the same framework both in terms of quality and latency. In addition, it also offers an interactive web interface to demo any system built within the tool.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音识别模型在通用转录方面表现出色，但在识别罕见或未见过的命名实体（如联系人姓名、地点）方面存在困难，而这些实体对于虚拟助手等下游应用至关重要

Method: 使用命名实体候选列表，同时预测多个未来token，让模型能够'展望未来'并对实体列表中的潜在候选进行评分，利用多token预测逻辑而不需要额外的实体编码器或交叉注意力层，显著降低了架构复杂度

Result: 在Librispeech数据集上的实验表明，相比基线AED模型，该方法在命名实体词错误率上实现了高达50.34%的相对提升

Conclusion: 该方法通过简单的多token预测机制有效提升了AED模型对命名实体的识别能力，为上下文偏置提供了更简化的解决方案

Abstract: While end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models excel at general transcription, they struggle to recognize rare or unseen named entities (e.g., contact names, locations), which are critical for downstream applications like virtual assistants. In this paper, we propose a contextual biasing method for attention based encoder decoder (AED) models using a list of candidate named entities. Instead of predicting only the next token, we simultaneously predict multiple future tokens, enabling the model to "peek into the future" and score potential candidate entities in the entity list. Moreover, our approach leverages the multi-token prediction logits directly without requiring additional entity encoders or cross-attention layers, significantly reducing architectural complexity. Experiments on Librispeech demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 50.34% relative improvement in named entity word error rate compared to the baseline AED model.

Abstract: We explore Bayesian reasoning as a means to quantify uncertainty in neural networks for question answering. Starting with a multilayer perceptron on the Iris dataset, we show how posterior inference conveys confidence in predictions. We then extend this to language models, applying Bayesian inference first to a frozen head and finally to LoRA-adapted transformers, evaluated on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art accuracy, we compare Laplace approximations against maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates to highlight uncertainty calibration and selective prediction. This allows models to abstain when confidence is low. An ``I don't know'' response not only improves interpretability but also illustrates how Bayesian methods can contribute to more responsible and ethical deployment of neural question-answering systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) is characterised by frequent use of non-standard language, from spelling errors to expressive choices such as slang, character repetitions, and emojis. This makes evaluating UGC translation particularly challenging: what counts as a "good" translation depends on the level of standardness desired in the output. To explore this, we examine the human translation guidelines of four UGC datasets, and derive a taxonomy of twelve non-standard phenomena and five translation actions (NORMALISE, COPY, TRANSFER, OMIT, CENSOR). Our analysis reveals notable differences in how UGC is treated, resulting in a spectrum of standardness in reference translations. Through a case study on large language models (LLMs), we show that translation scores are highly sensitive to prompts with explicit translation instructions for UGC, and that they improve when these align with the dataset's guidelines. We argue that when preserving UGC style is important, fair evaluation requires both models and metrics to be aware of translation guidelines. Finally, we call for clear guidelines during dataset creation and for the development of controllable, guideline-aware evaluation frameworks for UGC translation.

Abstract: Work in Computational Affective Science and Computational Social Science explores a wide variety of research questions about people, emotions, behavior, and health. Such work often relies on language data that is first labeled with relevant information, such as the use of emotion words or the age of the speaker. Although many resources and algorithms exist to enable this type of labeling, discovering, accessing, and using them remains a substantial impediment, particularly for practitioners outside of computer science. Here, we present the ABCDE dataset (Affect, Body, Cognition, Demographics, and Emotion), a large-scale collection of over 400 million text utterances drawn from social media, blogs, books, and AI-generated sources. The dataset is annotated with a wide range of features relevant to computational affective and social science. ABCDE facilitates interdisciplinary research across numerous fields, including affective science, cognitive science, the digital humanities, sociology, political science, and computational linguistics.

Abstract: Comprehension of ancient texts plays an important role in archaeology and understanding of Chinese history and civilization. The rapid development of large language models needs benchmarks that can evaluate their comprehension of ancient characters. Existing Chinese benchmarks are mostly targeted at modern Chinese and transmitted documents in ancient Chinese, but the part of excavated documents in ancient Chinese is not covered. To meet this need, we propose the AncientBench, which aims to evaluate the comprehension of ancient characters, especially in the scenario of excavated documents. The AncientBench is divided into four dimensions, which correspond to the four competencies of ancient character comprehension: glyph comprehension, pronunciation comprehension, meaning comprehension, and contextual comprehension. The benchmark also contains ten tasks, including radical, phonetic radical, homophone, cloze, translation, and more, providing a comprehensive framework for evaluation. We convened archaeological researchers to conduct experimental evaluations, proposed an ancient model as baseline, and conducted extensive experiments on the currently best-performing large language models. The experimental results reveal the great potential of large language models in ancient textual scenarios as well as the gap with humans. Our research aims to promote the development and application of large language models in the field of archaeology and ancient Chinese language.

Abstract: Medical Entity Recognition (MedER) is an essential NLP task for extracting meaningful entities from the medical corpus. Nowadays, MedER-based research outcomes can remarkably contribute to the development of automated systems in the medical sector, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes. While extensive research has been conducted on MedER in English, low-resource languages like Bangla remain underexplored. Our work aims to bridge this gap. For Bangla medical entity recognition, this study first examined a number of transformer models, including BERT, DistilBERT, ELECTRA, and RoBERTa. We also propose a novel Multi-BERT Ensemble approach that outperformed all baseline models with the highest accuracy of 89.58%. Notably, it provides an 11.80% accuracy improvement over the single-layer BERT model, demonstrating its effectiveness for this task. A major challenge in MedER for low-resource languages is the lack of annotated datasets. To address this issue, we developed a high-quality dataset tailored for the Bangla MedER task. The dataset was used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model through multiple performance metrics, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our findings highlight the potential of Multi-BERT Ensemble models in improving MedER for Bangla and set the foundation for further advancements in low-resource medical NLP.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型能够生成专业级别的研究报告，现有评估方法存在系统性问题：缺乏专业报告评估标准、依赖LLM评估可能忽略专家判断需求、以及现有事实核查只覆盖有限引用而非整体报告的可信度。

Method: 开发DEER基准测试，包含50个报告写作任务跨越13个领域，建立专家基础评估分类法（7个维度，25个子维度，130个详细评分项），提供任务特定专家指导帮助LLM评估；同时提出文档级事实核查架构，提取并验证报告中所有声明（包括未引用的），量化外部证据质量。

Conclusion: DEER基准测试为评估专业级深度研究报告提供了全面、专家基础和可解释的评估框架，解决了现有评估方法的局限性，并通过整合评估分类法和文档级事实核查提升了评估的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, deep research systems can generate expert-level reports via multi-step reasoning and evidence-based synthesis, but evaluating such reports remains challenging. Existing benchmarks often lack systematic criteria for expert reporting, evaluations that rely heavily on LLM judges can fail to capture issues that require expert judgment, and source verification typically covers only a limited subset of explicitly cited statements rather than report-wide factual reliability. We introduce DEER, a benchmark for evaluating expert-level deep research reports. DEER comprises 50 report-writing tasks spanning 13 domains and an expert-grounded evaluation taxonomy (7 dimensions, 25 sub-dimension) operationalized into 130 fine-grained rubric items. DEER further provides task-specific expert guidance to help LLM judges assess expert-level report quality more consistently. Complementing rubric-based assessment, we propose a document-level fact-checking architecture that extracts and verifies all claims across the entire report, including both cited and uncited ones, and quantifies external-evidence quality. DEER correlates closely with human expert judgments and yields interpretable diagnostics of system strengths and weaknesses.

Motivation: 传统的'线性'实体集扩展方法无法展现知识资源中更丰富的'分类'结构，而现有的基于逻辑的扩张图框架虽然支持基于知识库的分类扩展，但完整构造此类图在实际场景中可能不切实际。

Method: 形式化定义了扩张图中的推理任务，用于判断两个实体元组是否属于图中可比、不可比或相同的节点。在限定输入规模或实体描述的条件下，这些任务可以实现高效计算。

Result: 研究结果表明，在现实假设下（如限定输入或限制实体描述），这些推理任务可以高效实现。这使得能够对扩张图进行局部的增量导航，无需完整构建整个图。

Conclusion: 该方法支持实际应用中对扩张图的局部导航，避免了完整图构造的复杂度，为基于知识库的实体集分类扩展提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recognizing similarities among entities is central to both human cognition and computational intelligence. Within this broader landscape, Entity Set Expansion is one prominent task aimed at taking an initial set of (tuples of) entities and identifying additional ones that share relevant semantic properties with the former -- potentially repeating the process to form increasingly broader sets. However, this ``linear'' approach does not unveil the richer ``taxonomic'' structures present in knowledge resources. A recent logic-based framework introduces the notion of an expansion graph: a rooted directed acyclic graph where each node represents a semantic generalization labeled by a logical formula, and edges encode strict semantic inclusion. This structure supports taxonomic expansions of entity sets driven by knowledge bases. Yet, the potentially large size of such graphs may make full materialization impractical in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, we formalize reasoning tasks that check whether two tuples belong to comparable, incomparable, or the same nodes in the graph. Our results show that, under realistic assumptions -- such as bounding the input or limiting entity descriptions -- these tasks can be implemented efficiently. This enables local, incremental navigation of expansion graphs, supporting practical applications without requiring full graph construction.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in complex, multi-step workflows involving planning, tool use, reflection, and interaction with external knowledge systems. These workflows generate rapidly expanding contexts that must be curated, transformed, and compressed to maintain fidelity, avoid attention dilution, and reduce inference cost. Prior work on summarization and query-aware compression largely ignores the multi-step, plan-aware nature of agentic reasoning. In this work, we introduce PAACE (Plan-Aware Automated Context Engineering), a unified framework for optimizing the evolving state of LLM agents through next-k-task relevance modeling, plan-structure analysis, instruction co-refinement, and function-preserving compression. PAACE comprises (1) PAACE-Syn, a large-scale generator of synthetic agent workflows annotated with stepwise compression supervision, and (2) PAACE-FT, a family of distilled, plan-aware compressors trained from successful teacher demonstrations. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks (AppWorld, OfficeBench, and 8-Objective QA) demonstrate that PAACE consistently improves agent correctness while substantially reducing context load. On AppWorld, PAACE achieves higher accuracy than all baselines while lowering peak context and cumulative dependency. On OfficeBench and multi-hop QA, PAACE improves both accuracy and F1, achieving fewer steps, lower peak tokens, and reduced attention dependency.

Abstract: Despite advances in scientific AI, a coherent framework for Scientific General Intelligence (SGI)-the ability to autonomously conceive, investigate, and reason across scientific domains-remains lacking. We present an operational SGI definition grounded in the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM: Deliberation, Conception, Action, Perception) and operationalize it via four scientist-aligned tasks: deep research, idea generation, dry/wet experiments, and experimental reasoning. SGI-Bench comprises over 1,000 expert-curated, cross-disciplinary samples inspired by Science's 125 Big Questions, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs. Results reveal gaps: low exact match (10--20%) in deep research despite step-level alignment; ideas lacking feasibility and detail; high code executability but low execution result accuracy in dry experiments; low sequence fidelity in wet protocols; and persistent multimodal comparative-reasoning challenges. We further introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which optimizes retrieval-augmented novelty rewards at inference, enhancing hypothesis novelty without reference answer. Together, our PIM-grounded definition, workflow-centric benchmark, and empirical insights establish a foundation for AI systems that genuinely participate in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has traditionally focused on entity-centric queries that return a single answer entity. However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.

Abstract: Human conflict is often attributed to threats against material conditions and symbolic values, yet it remains unclear how they interact and which dominates. Progress is limited by weak causal control, ethical constraints, and scarce temporal data. We address these barriers using simulations of large language model (LLM)-driven agents in virtual societies, independently varying realistic and symbolic threat while tracking actions, language, and attitudes. Representational analyses show that the underlying LLM encodes realistic threat, symbolic threat, and hostility as distinct internal states, that our manipulations map onto them, and that steering these states causally shifts behavior. Our simulations provide a causal account of threat-driven conflict over time: realistic threat directly increases hostility, whereas symbolic threat effects are weaker, fully mediated by ingroup bias, and increase hostility only when realistic threat is absent. Non-hostile intergroup contact buffers escalation, and structural asymmetries concentrate hostility among majority groups.

Abstract: We generalize the AIXI reinforcement learning agent to admit a wider class of utility functions. Assigning a utility to each possible interaction history forces us to confront the ambiguity that some hypotheses in the agent's belief distribution only predict a finite prefix of the history, which is sometimes interpreted as implying a chance of death equal to a quantity called the semimeasure loss. This death interpretation suggests one way to assign utilities to such history prefixes. We argue that it is as natural to view the belief distributions as imprecise probability distributions, with the semimeasure loss as total ignorance. This motivates us to consider the consequences of computing expected utilities with Choquet integrals from imprecise probability theory, including an investigation of their computability level. We recover the standard recursive value function as a special case. However, our most general expected utilities under the death interpretation cannot be characterized as such Choquet integrals.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in coding assistants. While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and multi-turn interactions but struggle to continuously improve and adapt when deployed in new environments. One promising approach is implementing skill libraries that allow agents to learn, validate, and apply new skills. However, current skill library approaches rely primarily on LLM prompting, making consistent skill library implementation challenging. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approach to enhance agents' self-improvement capabilities with a skill library. Specifically, we introduce Skill Augmented GRPO for self-Evolution (SAGE), a novel RL framework that systematically incorporates skills into learning. The framework's key component, Sequential Rollout, iteratively deploys agents across a chain of similar tasks for each rollout. As agents navigate through the task chain, skills generated from previous tasks accumulate in the library and become available for subsequent tasks. Additionally, the framework enhances skill generation and utilization through a Skill-integrated Reward that complements the original outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on AppWorld demonstrate that SAGE, when applied to supervised-finetuned model with expert experience, achieves 8.9% higher Scenario Goal Completion while requiring 26% fewer interaction steps and generating 59% fewer tokens, substantially outperforming existing approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 在不确定性下的AI推理是一个关键挑战，尤其是在现实任务中，稀疏数据需要系统泛化。现有方法在评估多个候选方案时难以平衡准确性和简单性。

Method: 提出一种受Solomonoff启发的方法，该方法通过简单性和预测拟合度来加权LLM生成的假设，应用于基准任务（Mini-ARC）时，为每个单元格预测生成Solomonoff加权混合，产生保守、不确定性感知的输出。

Result: 与贝叶斯模型平均法（BMA）相比，Solomonoff评分在竞争假设之间更均匀地分布概率，而BMA将权重集中在最可能但可能有缺陷的候选方案上。

Conclusion: 在多项任务中，该方法突显了算法信息论先验对于不确定性下可解释、可靠的多假设推理的价值。

Abstract: Reasoning under uncertainty is a key challenge in AI, especially for real-world tasks, where problems with sparse data demands systematic generalisation. Existing approaches struggle to balance accuracy and simplicity when evaluating multiple candidate solutions. We propose a Solomonoff-inspired method that weights LLM-generated hypotheses by simplicity and predictive fit. Applied to benchmark (Mini-ARC) tasks, our method produces Solomonoff-weighted mixtures for per-cell predictions, yielding conservative, uncertainty-aware outputs even when hypotheses are noisy or partially incorrect. Compared to Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Solomonoff scoring spreads probability more evenly across competing hypotheses, while BMA concentrates weight on the most likely but potentially flawed candidates. Across tasks, this highlights the value of algorithmic information-theoretic priors for interpretable, reliable multi-hypothesis reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) enables highly credible generation by integrating external multi-modal knowledge, thus demonstrating impressive performance in complex multi-modal scenarios. However, existing MMRAG methods fail to clarify the reasoning logic behind retrieval and response generation, which limits the explainability of the results. To address this gap, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning into multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models through a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework to achieve explainable multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation. Specifically, in the first stage, rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning is employed to perform coarse-grained point-wise ranking of multi-modal documents, effectively filtering out those that are significantly irrelevant. In the second stage, reasoning-based reinforcement fine-tuning is utilized to jointly optimize fine-grained list-wise ranking and answer generation, guiding multi-modal large language models to output explainable reasoning logic in the MMRAG process. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on WebQA and MultimodalQA, two benchmark datasets for multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation, and its effectiveness is validated through comprehensive ablation experiments.

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding and generation has shown impressive capabilities in cutting-edge proprietary systems. However, evaluations of unified multimodal models (UMMs) remain decoupled, assessing their understanding and generation abilities separately with corresponding datasets. To address this, we propose UmniBench, a benchmark tailored for UMMs with omni-dimensional evaluation. First, UmniBench can assess the understanding, generation, and editing ability within a single evaluation process. Based on human-examined prompts and QA pairs, UmniBench leverages UMM itself to evaluate its generation and editing ability with its understanding ability. This simple but effective paradigm allows comprehensive evaluation of UMMs. Second, UmniBench covers 13 major domains and more than 200 concepts, ensuring a thorough inspection of UMMs. Moreover, UmniBench can also decouple and separately evaluate understanding, generation, and editing abilities, providing a fine-grained assessment. Based on UmniBench, we benchmark 24 popular models, including both UMMs and single-ability large models. We hope this benchmark provides a more comprehensive and objective view of unified models and logistical support for improving the performance of the community model.

Abstract: Real-time sequential control agents are often bottlenecked by inference latency. Even modest per-step planning delays can destabilize control and degrade overall performance. We propose a speculation-and-correction framework that adapts the predict-then-verify philosophy of speculative execution to model-based control with TD-MPC2. At each step, a pretrained world model and latent-space MPC planner generate a short-horizon action queue together with predicted latent rollouts, allowing the agent to execute multiple planned actions without immediate replanning. When a new observation arrives, the system measures the mismatch between the encoded real latent state and the queued predicted latent. For small to moderate mismatch, a lightweight learned corrector applies a residual update to the speculative action, distilled offline from a replanning teacher. For large mismatch, the agent safely falls back to full replanning and clears stale action queues. We study both a gated two-tower MLP corrector and a temporal Transformer corrector to address local errors and systematic drift. Experiments on the DMC Humanoid-Walk task show that our method reduces the number of planning inferences from 500 to 282, improves end-to-end step latency by 25 percent, and maintains strong control performance with only a 7.1 percent return reduction. Ablation results demonstrate that speculative execution without correction is unreliable over longer horizons, highlighting the necessity of mismatch-aware correction for robust latency reduction.

Abstract: Transfers play a pivotal role in shaping a football club's success, yet forecasting whether a transfer will succeed remains difficult due to the strong context-dependence of on-field performance. Existing evaluation practices often rely on static summary statistics or post-hoc value models, which fail to capture how a player's contribution adapts to a new tactical environment or different teammates. To address this gap, we introduce EventGPT, a player-conditioned, value-aware next-event prediction model built on a GPT-style autoregressive transformer. Our model treats match play as a sequence of discrete tokens, jointly learning to predict the next on-ball action's type, location, timing, and its estimated residual On-Ball Value (rOBV) based on the preceding context and player identity. A key contribution of this framework is the ability to perform counterfactual simulations. By substituting learned player embeddings into new event sequences, we can simulate how a player's behavioral distribution and value profile would change when placed in a different team or tactical structure. Evaluated on five seasons of Premier League event data, EventGPT outperforms existing sequence-based baselines in next-event prediction accuracy and spatial precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's practical utility for transfer analysis through case studies-such as comparing striker performance across different systems and identifying stylistic replacements for specific roles-showing that our approach provides a principled method for evaluating transfer fit.

TL;DR: 从算法信息论视角定义概念：概念是信息对象，通过其与主体经验的结构关系定义，核心是构成部分间的可逆一致性约束，避免概念脱离经验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI能否在无人类监督下从原始经验中发现人类已发现的概念。挑战在于人类概念本身是流动的（边界会变化、分裂、合并），因此需要不依赖词典标签、可修正、可比较、可在主体间对齐的概念定义。

Method: 采用算法信息论视角，将概念视为信息对象，仅通过其与主体总体经验的结构关系定义。核心约束是确定性：一组部分构成可逆一致性关系（即任一缺失部分可从其余部分恢复，考虑Kolmogorov式恒等式的对数松弛量）。为防止'概念'脱离经验，定义了信息过量来衡量将经验拆分为多个单独描述部分引入的冗余开销。基于这些定义，将辩证法形式化为优化动态：新信息块出现（或产生争议）时，竞争概念会试图通过更短的条件描述来解释它们，推动系统性扩张、收缩、分裂与合并。

Result: 提出了概念的形式化定义框架，强调可逆性约束防止概念脱离经验，并将概念存在转化为可检验的结构性主张。定义了信息过量以评估拆分的自然性，并形式化了作为优化动态的辩证法过程。最终，利用小规模基础/种子实现低成本概念传输和多主体对齐，使通讯成为具体计算与比特的权衡。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI无监督概念发现提供了基于算法信息论的形式化基础，通过可逆性约束和辩证法动态支持概念的流动性与对齐，使概念发现成为可计算的结构性问题，并为多主体间的概念共享建立了具体协议。

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence discover, from raw experience and without human supervision, concepts that humans have discovered? One challenge is that human concepts themselves are fluid: conceptual boundaries can shift, split, and merge as inquiry progresses (e.g., Pluto is no longer considered a planet). To make progress, we need a definition of "concept" that is not merely a dictionary label, but a structure that can be revised, compared, and aligned across agents. We propose an algorithmic-information viewpoint that treats a concept as an information object defined only through its structural relation to an agent's total experience. The core constraint is determination: a set of parts forms a reversible consistency relation if any missing part is recoverable from the others (up to the standard logarithmic slack in Kolmogorov-style identities). This reversibility prevents "concepts" from floating free of experience and turns concept existence into a checkable structural claim. To judge whether a decomposition is natural, we define excess information, measuring the redundancy overhead introduced by splitting experience into multiple separately described parts. On top of these definitions, we formulate dialectics as an optimization dynamics: as new patches of information appear (or become contested), competing concepts bid to explain them via shorter conditional descriptions, driving systematic expansion, contraction, splitting, and merging. Finally, we formalize low-cost concept transmission and multi-agent alignment using small grounds/seeds that allow another agent to reconstruct the same concept under a shared protocol, making communication a concrete compute-bits trade-off.

Abstract: The Rashomon effect describes the phenomenon where multiple models trained on the same data produce identical predictions while differing in which features they rely on internally. This effect has been studied extensively in classification tasks, but not in sequential decision-making, where an agent learns a policy to achieve an objective by taking actions in an environment. In this paper, we translate the Rashomon effect to sequential decision-making. We define it as multiple policies that exhibit identical behavior, visiting the same states and selecting the same actions, while differing in their internal structure, such as feature attributions. Verifying identical behavior in sequential decision-making differs from classification. In classification, predictions can be directly compared to ground-truth labels. In sequential decision-making with stochastic transitions, the same policy may succeed or fail on any single trajectory due to randomness. We address this using formal verification methods that construct and compare the complete probabilistic behavior of each policy in the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that the Rashomon effect exists in sequential decision-making. We further show that ensembles constructed from the Rashomon set exhibit greater robustness to distribution shifts than individual policies. Additionally, permissive policies derived from the Rashomon set reduce computational requirements for verification while maintaining optimal performance.

Abstract: Healthcare systems around the world are grappling with issues like inefficient diagnostics, rising costs, and limited access to specialists. These problems often lead to delays in treatment and poor health outcomes. Most current AI and deep learning diagnostic systems are not very interactive or transparent, making them less effective in real-world, patient-centered environments. This research introduces a diagnostic chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), using GPT-4o, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and explainable AI techniques. The chatbot engages patients in a dynamic conversation, helping to extract and normalize symptoms while prioritizing potential diagnoses through similarity matching and adaptive questioning. With Chain-of-Thought prompting, the system also offers more transparent reasoning behind its diagnoses. When tested against traditional machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN, the LLM-based system delivered impressive results, achieving an accuracy of 90% and Top-3 accuracy of 100%. These findings offer a promising outlook for more transparent, interactive, and clinically relevant AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Reward specification plays a central role in reinforcement learning (RL), guiding the agent's behavior. To express non-Markovian rewards, formalisms such as reward machines have been introduced to capture dependencies on histories. However, traditional reward machines lack the ability to model precise timing constraints, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. In this paper, we propose timed reward machines (TRMs), which are an extension of reward machines that incorporate timing constraints into the reward structure. TRMs enable more expressive specifications with tunable reward logic, for example, imposing costs for delays and granting rewards for timely actions. We study model-free RL frameworks (i.e., tabular Q-learning) for learning optimal policies with TRMs under digital and real-time semantics. Our algorithms integrate the TRM into learning via abstractions of timed automata, and employ counterfactual-imagining heuristics that exploit the structure of the TRM to improve the search. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our algorithm learns policies that achieve high rewards while satisfying the timing constraints specified by the TRM on popular RL benchmarks. Moreover, we conduct comparative studies of performance under different TRM semantics, along with ablations that highlight the benefits of counterfactual-imagining.

Abstract: Over a billion users across the globe interact with AI systems engineered with increasing sophistication to mimic human traits. This shift has triggered urgent debate regarding Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human characteristics to synthetic agents, and its potential to induce misplaced trust or emotional dependency. However, the causal link between more humanlike AI design and subsequent effects on engagement and trust has not been tested in realistic human-AI interactions with a global user pool. Prevailing safety frameworks continue to rely on theoretical assumptions derived from Western populations, overlooking the global diversity of AI users. Here, we address these gaps through two large-scale cross-national experiments (N=3,500) across 10 diverse nations, involving real-time and open-ended interactions with an AI system. We find that when evaluating an AI's human-likeness, users focus less on the kind of theoretical aspects often cited in policy (e.g., sentience or consciousness), but rather applied, interactional cues like conversation flow or understanding the user's perspective. We also experimentally demonstrate that humanlike design levers can causally increase anthropomorphism among users; however, we do not find that humanlike design universally increases behavioral measures for user engagement and trust, as previous theoretical work suggests. Instead, part of the connection between human-likeness and behavioral outcomes is fractured by culture: specific design choices that foster self-reported trust in AI-systems in some populations (e.g., Brazil) may trigger the opposite result in others (e.g., Japan). Our findings challenge prevailing narratives of inherent risk in humanlike AI design. Instead, we identify a nuanced, culturally mediated landscape of human-AI interaction, which demands that we move beyond a one-size-fits-all approach in AI governance.

*Junyu Zhang,Yifan Sun,Tianang Leng,Jingyan Shen,Liu Ziyin,Paul Pu Liang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了推理法则（Laws of Reasoning, LoRe）框架，用于形式化大型推理模型的内在推理模式，并通过LoRe-Bench评估模型在单调性和组合性上的表现，进而开发微调方法提升模型对计算法则的遵循度，从而改善推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型推理模型性能优越，但其推理行为常违反直觉，导致推理能力次优。为从理论上形式化期望的推理行为，需建立统一框架来刻画模型的内在推理模式。

Method: 1）提出计算法则，假设推理计算应与问题复杂度线性缩放；2）扩展准确率法则；3）通过单调性和组合性两个可处理属性检验法则；4）建立LoRe-Bench基准系统评估模型属性；5）开发微调方法强制模型遵循计算法则的组合性。

Result: 评估显示大多数推理模型具有合理的单调性但缺乏组合性。通过强制计算法则组合性的微调，模型在多个基准测试上推理性能得到持续提升，并揭示了属性和法则间的协同效应。

Conclusion: 更好地遵循推理法则能显著提升大型推理模型的推理性能，LoRe为模型推理行为提供了理论框架和实用评估工具，有助于开发更可靠的推理系统。

Abstract: Despite the superior performance of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their reasoning behaviors are often counterintuitive, leading to suboptimal reasoning capabilities. To theoretically formalize the desired reasoning behaviors, this paper presents the Laws of Reasoning (LoRe), a unified framework that characterizes intrinsic reasoning patterns in LRMs. We first propose compute law with the hypothesis that the reasoning compute should scale linearly with question complexity. Beyond compute, we extend LoRe with a supplementary accuracy law. Since the question complexity is difficult to quantify in practice, we examine these hypotheses by two properties of the laws, monotonicity and compositionality. We therefore introduce LoRe-Bench, a benchmark that systematically measures these two tractable properties for large reasoning models. Evaluation shows that most reasoning models exhibit reasonable monotonicity but lack compositionality. In response, we develop an effective finetuning approach that enforces compute-law compositionality. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that better compliance with compute laws yields consistently improved reasoning performance on multiple benchmarks, and uncovers synergistic effects across properties and laws.

### [139] [On the Role of Contextual Information and Ego States in LLM Agent Behavior for Transactional Analysis Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17060)
*Monika Zamojska,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于交互分析理论的LLM多智能体系统，通过将每个智能体划分为父母、成人、儿童三种自我状态，并加入信息检索机制，来增强智能体的心理深度和行为真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM智能体在模拟人类群体动态和社会行为时，缺乏心理深度和一致性，无法捕捉人类思维的真实模式，尤其是深层目标、情感冲突和动机等复杂心理因素。

Method: 设计了一个基于交互分析理论的多智能体系统，每个智能体包含三个自我状态（父母、成人、儿童），每个状态都有独立的知识结构和推理风格，同时通过信息检索机制获取相关上下文信息。

Result: 通过在模拟对话场景中的消融实验，对比了有无信息检索机制的智能体表现，结果显示该方法具有前景，能够提升智能体行为的真实感。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的将交互分析理论与上下文信息检索相结合的智能体架构，为探索基于心理学的智能体结构如何丰富多智能体模拟行为开辟了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are now used in many areas, from customer support to education, and there is increasing interest in their ability to act more like humans. This includes fields such as social, political, and psychological research, where the goal is to model group dynamics and social behavior. However, current LLM agents often lack the psychological depth and consistency needed to capture the real patterns of human thinking. They usually provide direct or statistically likely answers, but they miss the deeper goals, emotional conflicts, and motivations that drive real human interactions. This paper proposes a Multi-Agent System (MAS) inspired by Transactional Analysis (TA) theory. In the proposed system, each agent is divided into three ego states - Parent, Adult, and Child. The ego states are treated as separate knowledge structures with their own perspectives and reasoning styles. To enrich their response process, they have access to an information retrieval mechanism that allows them to retrieve relevant contextual information from their vector stores. This architecture is evaluated through ablation tests in a simulated dialogue scenario, comparing agents with and without information retrieval. The results are promising and open up new directions for exploring how psychologically grounded structures can enrich agent behavior. The contribution is an agent architecture that integrates Transactional Analysis theory with contextual information retrieval to enhance the realism of LLM-based multi-agent simulations.

Abstract: Spatial public goods games model collective dilemmas where individual payoffs depend on population-level strategy configurations. Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.

Abstract: As LLM-based agents grow more autonomous and multi-modal, ensuring they remain controllable, auditable, and faithful to deployer intent becomes critical. Prior benchmarks measured the propensity for misaligned behavior and showed that agent personalities and tool access significantly influence misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose a Verifiability-First architecture that (1) integrates run-time attestations of agent actions using cryptographic and symbolic methods, (2) embeds lightweight Audit Agents that continuously verify intent versus behavior using constrained reasoning, and (3) enforces challenge-response attestation protocols for high-risk operations. We introduce OPERA (Observability, Provable Execution, Red-team, Attestation), a benchmark suite and evaluation protocol designed to measure (i) detectability of misalignment, (ii) time to detection under stealthy strategies, and (iii) resilience of verifiability mechanisms to adversarial prompt and persona injection. Our approach shifts the evaluation focus from how likely misalignment is to how quickly and reliably misalignment can be detected and remediated.

Method: 开发Idea Islands VR系统作为实验平台，通过2个受控实验收集19名参与者的使用数据，比较不同交互模式的效果。

Result: 发现宏观视角有助于战略性广度探索，沉浸式体验通过具身在场维持参与度，无缝过渡支持两种模式的灵活结合。

Conclusion: 验证了该框架的设计价值，提出将信息视为可探索领域的设计建议，适用于创意、教育、知识密集型等领域的未来系统设计。

Abstract: Working with abstract information often relies on static, symbolic representations that constrain exploration. We introduce Explorable Ideas, a framework that externalizes abstract concepts into explorable environments where physical navigation coordinates conceptual exploration. To investigate its practical value, we designed Idea Islands, a VR probe for ideation tasks, and conducted two controlled studies with 19 participants. Results show that overview perspectives foster strategic breadth while immersion sustains engagement through embodied presence, and that seamless transitions enable flexible workflows combining both modes. These findings validate the framework's design considerations and yield design implications for building future systems that treat information as explorable territory across creative, educational, and knowledge-intensive domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Although serious games have been increasingly used for mental health applications, few explicitly address coping with grief as a core mechanic and narrative experience for patients. Existing grief-related digital games often focus on clinical training for medical professionals rather than immersive storytelling and agency in emotional processing for the patient. In response, we designed Road to Acceptance, a VR game that presents grief through first-person narrative and gameplay. As the next phase of evaluation, we propose a workshop-based study with 12 licensed mental health professionals to assess the therapeutic impacts of the game and the alignment with best practices in grief education and interventions. This will inform iterative game design and patient evaluation methods, ensuring that the experience is clinically appropriate. Potential findings can contribute to the design principles of grief-related virtual reality experiences, bridging the gap between interactive media, mental health interventions, and immersive storytelling.

TL;DR: 该研究发现推广型Twitter机器人的行为特征并非静态，而是在个体特征和特征间关系两个层面都随时间动态变化，这对基于历史行为特征的机器人检测系统设计有直接影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数机器人检测系统将行为特征视为静态，隐含假设机器人行为随时间平稳。本研究旨在检验推广型Twitter机器人行为的平稳性假设，探究其行为特征是否随时间变化。

Method: 使用2,615个推广型机器人账户和280万条推文，构建十个基于内容的元特征的年度时间序列。采用增广迪基-富勒检验、KPSS检验和线性趋势分析检测平稳性。按激活代际和账户年龄分层分析，并使用卡方检验和斯皮尔曼相关性分析18个可解释的二元特征间的共现关系。

Result: 所有十个元特征都是非平稳的：九个随时间增加，只有语言多样性略有下降。不同代际和年龄的机器人展现系统性差异：第二代机器人最活跃且链接使用最多；短期机器人活动密集、重复且大量使用标签/URL；长期机器人活动较少但语言更多样，表情符号使用更丰富。几乎所有特征对都存在依赖性，且相关性强度和极性随时间变化，后期代际的线索组合更加结构化。

Conclusion: 推广型社交机器人会在个体元特征和特征间依赖关系两个层面随时间适应和演化，这一发现对依赖历史行为特征的机器人检测系统的设计和评估具有直接意义，表明需要开发能捕捉行为动态变化的检测方法。

Abstract: Social bots are now deeply embedded in online platforms for promotion, persuasion, and manipulation. Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.
  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.
  Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features.

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了虚拟现实（VR）如何通过两个应用案例来支持塑料回收服务设计，分别针对回收旅程的不同阶段，展示了VR在促进学习、参与和共同意义构建方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 塑料回收依赖于日常分类实践和服务沟通方式，VR能够以情境化、交互式的方式呈现这些要素，但目前在塑料回收服务设计中的应用仍处于初级阶段，因此需要研究VR工具在此领域的贡献。

Method: 通过两个VR应用案例进行研究：1）家庭规模VR密室逃脱游戏'Clean Cabin Escape'，让玩家按当地分类规则收集和分类垃圾并获得即时反馈；2）塑料回收中心VR模拟，在服务设计工作坊中供利益相关者探索布局、标识和顾客路径。分析VR如何支持学习、参与和共同意义构建，以及如何与其他服务设计方法互动。

Result: 研究发现VR能使家庭分类任务和复杂回收中心对公民和专业人员更加具体化，但也突出了硬件访问、上手难度、视觉保真度和回收规则本地化等方面的权衡取舍。

Conclusion: 论文总结指出将VR整合到塑料回收和循环经济服务的更广泛服务设计工具集中的机会，并指明未来研究方向，包括长期影响和包容性设计等方面的探索。

Abstract: Plastics recycling depends on everyday sorting practices and on how recycling services are communicated and experienced. Virtual reality (VR) can present these practices and services in situated, interactive form, yet its role in service design for plastics recycling is still emerging. This paper examines how VR tools can contribute to designing plastics recycling services through two application cases that address different stages of the recycling journey. The first case, Clean Cabin Escape, is a household scale VR escape room where players collect and sort waste items into locally relevant categories, with immediate feedback that supports practice with plastics recycling decisions. The second case is a VR simulation of a plastics recycling center that represents a real planned site and is used in service design workshops where stakeholders explore layout, signage and customer paths for plastics fractions. Across the cases, we analyse how VR supported learning, engagement and shared sensemaking, and how it interacted with other service design methods such as workshops, customer path mapping and physical artefacts. The findings show that VR can make domestic sorting tasks and complex recycling centers more concrete for both citizens and professionals, but also highlight trade offs related to hardware access, onboarding effort, visual fidelity and localisation of recycling rules. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for integrating VR into broader service design toolsets for plastics recycling and circular economy services, and by pointing to directions for future research on long term impact and inclusive design.

Abstract: Human-AI interactions are increasingly part of everyday life, yet the interpersonal dynamics that unfold during such exchanges remain underexplored. This study investigates how emotional alignment, semantic exploration, and linguistic innovation emerge within a collaborative storytelling paradigm that paired human participants with a large language model (LLM) in a turn-taking setup. Over nine days, more than 3,000 museum visitors contributed to 27 evolving narratives, co-authored with an LLM in a naturalistic, public installation. To isolate the dynamics specific to human involvement, we compared the resulting dataset with a simulated baseline where two LLMs completed the same task. Using sentiment analysis, semantic embeddings, and information-theoretic measures of novelty and resonance, we trace how humans and models co-construct stories over time. Our results reveal that affective alignment is primarily driven by the model, with limited mutual convergence in human-AI interaction. At the same time, human participants explored a broader semantic space and introduced more novel, narratively influential contributions. These patterns were significantly reduced in the simulated AI-AI condition. Together, these findings highlight the unique role of human input in shaping narrative direction and creative divergence in co-authored texts. The methods developed here provide a scalable framework for analysing dyadic interaction and offer a new lens on creativity, emotional dynamics, and semantic coordination in human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and evaluation of a community-based artificial intelligence (AI) workflow developed for the Kaiapuni Assessment of Educational Outcomes (KĀ'EO) program, the only native language assessment used for federal accountability in the United States. The project explored whether document-grounded language models could ethically and effectively augment human analysis of item performance while preserving the cultural and linguistic integrity of the Hawaiian language. Operating under the KĀ'EO AI Policy Framework, the workflow used NotebookLM for cross-document synthesis of psychometric data and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for developer-facing interpretation, with human oversight at every stage. Fifty-eight flagged items across Hawaiian Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science were reviewed during Round 2 of the AI Lab, producing six interpretive briefs that identified systemic design issues such as linguistic ambiguity, Depth-of-Knowledge (DOK) misalignment, and structural overload. The findings demonstrate that AI can serve as an ethically bounded amplifier of human expertise, accelerating analysis while simultaneously prioritizing fairness, human expertise, and cultural authority. This work offers a replicable model for responsible AI integration in Indigenous-language educational measurement.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PILAR框架，利用预训练大语言模型为AI驱动的增强现实系统生成情境感知、个性化的解释，以提升用户体验和信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可解释AI方法在实时AR交互中存在局限性，无法提供动态、情境特定、个性化且以人为本的解释，导致用户体验碎片化。因此需要一种统一的方法来增强AR系统中的解释性和用户信任。

Method: 作者提出了PILAR框架，采用统一的大语言模型方法生成情境感知的个性化解释。该框架在真实AR应用（个性化食谱推荐）中实现原型，集成实时物体检测、食谱推荐和基于用户饮食偏好的LLM解释。

Result: 通过16名参与者的用户研究显示，LLM解释界面相比传统模板界面使任务完成速度提高40%，并显著提升了用户满意度、易用性和感知透明度。

Conclusion: PILAR框架通过LLM的统一解释方法有效解决了传统XAI在AR系统中的局限性，显著改善了用户体验和信任度，为实时AI驱动的AR系统提供了更直观可信的解释方案。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming increasingly integrated into daily life, and with this growth comes a greater need for explainability in real-time user interactions. Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字音乐工具强调精确控制，但缺乏支持基于环境交互的触觉即兴工作流，需要一种新方法来弥合感知与创作之间的鸿沟。

Method: 使用手持摄像头界面捕获视觉场景，GPT-4V分析图像生成结构化提示，用户选择乐器配置，通过Stable Audio文本到音乐管道实时生成可循环音乐片段，支持交互式分层。

Result: 开发了一个实时协同创作系统，允许用户通过具身交互进行框架化、捕获和分层音频，将生成式AI嵌入物理设备，实现了视觉、语言和声音的融合。

Conclusion: Lumia将生成式音乐重新定位为基于情境感官参与的即兴实践，而非参数调整任务，为创造性探索引入了新的感知与创作融合模态。

Abstract: Most digital music tools emphasize precision and control, but often lack support for tactile, improvisational workflows grounded in environmental interaction. Lumia addresses this by enabling users to "compose through looking"--transforming visual scenes into musical phrases using a handheld, camera-based interface and large multimodal models. A vision-language model (GPT-4V) analyzes captured imagery to generate structured prompts, which, combined with user-selected instrumentation, guide a text-to-music pipeline (Stable Audio). This real-time process allows users to frame, capture, and layer audio interactively, producing loopable musical segments through embodied interaction. The system supports a co-creative workflow where human intent and model inference shape the musical outcome. By embedding generative AI within a physical device, Lumia bridges perception and composition, introducing a new modality for creative exploration that merges vision, language, and sound. It repositions generative music not as a task of parameter tuning, but as an improvisational practice driven by contextual, sensory engagement.

Abstract: Learning Wudhu for young children requires engaging and interactive media to foster a deep understanding of the worship procedures. This study aims to develop a Wudhu learning application based on Augmented Reality (AR) as an interactive and fun educational medium. The development method used includes the stages of needs analysis, system design, implementation, and testing using Black Box Testing. The system utilizes marker-based tracking to display 3D animations of Wudhu movements in real-time when the camera detects a marker on the printed media. The test results indicate that all main functions run well, and a limited trial on children aged 5-7 years showed an increase in learning interest and a better understanding of the Wudhu sequence. Thus, the application of AR technology is proven effective in improving the quality of basic worship instruction for young children.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) based learning assistants and chatbots are increasingly integrated into higher education. While these tools are often evaluated in terms of technical performance, their successful and ethical use also depends on psychological factors such as trust, perceived risk, technology anxiety, and students general attitudes toward AI. This paper adopts a psychology oriented perspective to examine how university students form trust in AI based learning assistants. Drawing on recent literature in mental health, human AI interaction, and trust in automation, we propose a conceptual framework that organizes psychological predictors of trust into four groups: cognitive appraisals, affective reactions, social relational factors, and contextual moderators. A narrative review approach synthesizes empirical findings and derives research questions and hypotheses for future studies. The paper highlights that trust in AI is a psychological process shaped by individual differences and learning environments, with practical implications for instructors, administrators, and designers of educational AI systems.

Result: 通过篮球运动员跟腱和ACL损伤的案例研究，VAIR实现了更高效的识别和解释风险运动模式。专家反馈表明系统改善了诊断推理能力，并支持回顾性分析和主动干预规划

Conclusion: VAIR视觉分析系统为体育损伤风险评估提供了有效的工具，通过整合3D运动重建和生物力学分析，能够辅助专家识别损伤机制相关的运动模式

Abstract: Injury prevention in sports requires understanding how bio-mechanical risks emerge from movement patterns captured in real-world scenarios. However, identifying and interpreting injury prone events from raw video remains difficult and time-consuming. We present VAIR, a visual analytics system that supports injury risk analysis using 3D human motion reconstructed from sports video. VAIR combines pose estimation, bio-mechanical simulation, and synchronized visualizations to help users explore how joint-level risk indicators evolve over time. Domain experts can inspect movement segments through temporally aligned joint angles, angular velocity, and internal forces to detect patterns associated with known injury mechanisms. Through case studies involving Achilles tendon and Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in basketball, we show that VAIR enables more efficient identification and interpretation of risky movements. Expert feedback confirms that VAIR improves diagnostic reasoning and supports both retrospective analysis and proactive intervention planning.

Abstract: COVID-related closures of public and academic libraries have underlined the importance of online platforms that provide access to digitized print-based collections. However, they also have highlighted the value of in-person handling of print artefacts for sensing and making sense of them. How do existing dominant digital platforms invite and/or discourage embodied forms of exploration and sense-making? What opportunities for embodied experience might we discover if we embrace the material qualities of print-based collections when designing interfaces for digital access? In this paper, we present findings from a speculative exercise where we invited creative professionals and experts in curating and handling access to collections to reflect on existing approaches to digitized print-based collections and to speculate about alternative design opportunities and modes of engagement. We argue for digital bricolage-a design approach that values working with materials that are "on hand" and embracing our ability to "handle" them in ways that foster both casual and curious exploration.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了德语区受欢迎儿童应用中欺骗性设计模式与广告的普遍程度，发现所有应用都包含平均近6种不同的欺骗性模式且广告投放量大，尽管存在GDPR等法规框架，现有保障措施仍显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童的认知与情绪发展仍在进行中，特别易受操纵性界面与大量广告影响，可能导致屏幕时间过长、自我调节受阻及意外应用内购买等问题。

Method: 研究调查了德语区20个受欢迎的免费儿童应用，评估其欺骗性设计模式和广告的普遍程度。

Result: 所有应用均包含旨在助推、混淆或施压年轻用户的界面操纵手法，平均每应用近6种不同欺骗模式。多数应用还显示大量不可跳过广告，常嵌入核心游戏玩法中。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明现有保障措施系统性地未能保护儿童，呼吁加强监管、提高平台责任并建立以儿童为中心的设计标准。

Abstract: Mobile gaming apps are woven into children's daily lives. Given their ongoing cognitive and emotional development, children are especially vulnerable and depend on designs that safeguard their well-being. When apps feature manipulative interfaces or heavy advertising, they may exert undue influence on young users, contributing to prolonged screen time, disrupted self-regulation, and accidental in-app purchases. In this study, we examined 20 popular, free-to-download children's apps in German-speaking regions to assess the prevalence of deceptive design patterns and advertising. Despite platform policies and EU frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation and the Digital Services Act, every app contained interface manipulations intended to nudge, confuse, or pressure young users, averaging nearly six distinct deceptive patterns per app. Most also displayed high volumes of non-skippable ads, frequently embedded within core gameplay. These findings indicate a systemic failure of existing safeguards and call for stronger regulation, greater platform accountability, and child-centered design standards.

Abstract: Cognitive training for sustained attention and working memory is vital across domains relying on robust mental capacity such as education or rehabilitation. Adaptive systems are essential, dynamically matching difficulty to user ability to maintain engagement and accelerate learning. Current adaptive systems often rely on simple performance heuristics or predict visual complexity and affect instead of cognitive load. This study presents the first implementation of real-time adaptive cognitive load control in Virtual Reality cognitive training based on eye-tracking and physiological data. We developed a bidirectional LSTM model with a self-attention mechanism, trained on eye-tracking and physiological (PPG, GSR) data from 74 participants. We deployed it in real-time with 54 participants across single-task (sustained attention) and dual-task (sustained attention + mental arithmetic) paradigms. Difficulty was adjusted dynamically based on participant self-assessment or model's real-time cognitive load predictions. Participants showed a tendency to estimate the task as too difficult, even though they were objectively performing at their best. Over the course of a 10-minute session, both adaptation methods converged at equivalent difficulty in single-task scenarios, with no significant differences in subjective workload or game performance. However, in the dual-task conditions, the model successfully pushed users to higher difficulty levels without performance penalties or increased frustration, highlighting a user tendency to underestimate capacity under high cognitive load. Findings indicate that machine learning models may provide more objective cognitive capacity assessments than self-directed approaches, mitigating subjective performance biases and enabling more effective training by pushing users beyond subjective comfort zones toward physiologically-determined optimal challenge levels.

Abstract: AI video generation has lowered barriers to video creation, but current tools still struggle with inconsistency. Filmmakers often find that clips fail to match characters and backgrounds, making it difficult to build coherent sequences. A formative study with filmmakers highlighted challenges in shot composition, character motion, and camera control. We present Map2Video, a street view imagery-driven AI video generation tool grounded in real-world geographies. The system integrates Unity and ComfyUI with the VACE video generation model, as well as OpenStreetMap and Mapillary for street view imagery. Drawing on familiar filmmaking practices such as location scouting and rehearsal, Map2Video enables users to choose map locations, position actors and cameras in street view imagery, sketch movement paths, refine camera motion, and generate spatially consistent videos. We evaluated Map2Video with 12 filmmakers. Compared to an image-to-video baseline, it achieved higher spatial accuracy, required less cognitive effort, and offered stronger controllability for both scene replication and open-ended creative exploration.

Abstract: As multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in real-world workflows, users with diverse technical backgrounds are now building and refining their own agentic processes. However, these systems can fail in opaque ways, making it difficult for users to observe, understand, and correct errors. We conducted formative interviews with 12 practitioners to identify mismatches between existing observability tools and users' needs. Based on these insights, we designed XAgen, an explainability tool that supports users with varying AI expertise through three core capabilities: log visualization for glanceable workflow understanding, human-in-the-loop feedback to capture expert judgment, and automatic error detection via an LLM-as-a-judge. In a user study with 8 participants, XAgen helped users more easily locate failures, attribute to specific agents or steps, and iteratively improve configurations. Our findings surface human-centered design guidelines for explainable agentic AI development and highlights opportunities for more context-aware interactive debugging.

Abstract: Recent advances in video-language models have enabled powerful applications like video retrieval, captioning, and assembly. However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning). These results position Atom as a practical, scalable approach for efficient video-language understanding on edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽然性能强大，但其正交化步骤的超线性计算成本在高维度下带来较大开销，限制了可扩展性

Method: DION2通过在每个迭代中采样矩阵的一部分行或列，仅对这些子集进行正交化，从而减少计算和通信成本

Result: 该方法使更新变得稀疏，显著提升了Muon优化器的计算效率和可扩展性

Conclusion: DION2通过简化的采样机制有效降低了Muon的计算和通信开销，相比先前方法更为简单高效

Abstract: The Muon optimizer enjoys strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding. However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.

Conclusion: 该系统展示了可行的低成本、生物直观假肢控制路径，适合资源有限地区和全球健康应用，未来可改进3D打印外壳、自回归模型降低延迟、提升舵机扭矩等

Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

Method: 使用XGBoost梯度提升算法，仅基于表面观测数据(METAR)，通过热力学原理指导的特征工程，在11个不同气候区域的国际机场进行训练和评估

Result: 模型在3小时战术预报层面显著优于传统TAF预报，召回率提升2.5-4倍，同时降低误报率；SHAP分析显示模型能够隐式重建局地物理驱动过程

Conclusion: 基于METAR的轻量级机器学习框架能够在不需要手动配置的情况下捕捉局地物理过程，提供可解释的自动化预测，提升航空气象预报的准确性和时效性

Abstract: Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has re-emerged as a natural approach for training interactive LLM agents in real-world environments. However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.

Abstract: Non-stationary environments pose a fundamental challenge for deep reinforcement learning, as changes in dynamics or rewards invalidate learned value functions and cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose \emph{Gradient-Boosted Deep Q-Networks (GB-DQN)}, an adaptive ensemble method that addresses model drift through incremental residual learning. Instead of retraining a single Q-network, GB-DQN constructs an additive ensemble in which each new learner is trained to approximate the Bellman residual of the current ensemble after drift. We provide theoretical results showing that each boosting step reduces the empirical Bellman residual and that the ensemble converges to the post-drift optimal value function under standard assumptions. Experiments across a diverse set of control tasks with controlled dynamics changes demonstrate faster recovery, improved stability, and greater robustness compared to DQN and common non-stationary baselines.

Motivation: 在许多实际场景中，获取完全观测的样本成本过高甚至不可行，而收集部分噪声观测相对容易。本文旨在利用大量噪声样本来恢复原始分布。

Method: 将分布恢复任务框架化为单边熵最优传输问题，采用EM类算法求解；提出可恢复性测试准则；开发SFBD-OMNI框架，将SFBD推广到处理任意测量模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，在基准数据集和多样化测量设置下，该方法在定性和定量性能上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法能够有效地从噪声样本中恢复真实分布，特别是在不可恢复情况下，少量干净样本也能实现大部分恢复。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.

Abstract: Function calling agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) select external tools to automate complex tasks. On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length. However, existing retrieval methods rely on static and limited inputs, failing to capture multi-step tool dependencies and evolving task context. This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we explore strategies to integrate retrieved tools into prompts. Our results show that dynamic tool retrieval improves function calling success rates between $23\%$ and $104\%$ compared to state-of-the-art static retrievers.

Method: 通过数学分析严格证明(1)⇒(3)的蕴含关系，即在完备可分度量空间中若k最近邻分类器具有弱泛一致性，则空间满足Nagata意义上的σ-有限维性。同时对系列论文中的错误主张进行修正。

Abstract: We prove the last remaining implication allowing to claim the equivalence of the following conditions for a complete separable metric space $X$:
  (1) The $k$-nearest neighbour classifier is (weakly) universally consistent in $X$, (2) The strong Lebesgue--Besicovitch differentiation property holds in $X$ for every locally finite Borel measure, (3) $X$ is sigma-finite dimensional in the sense of Nagata.
  The equivalence (2)$\iff$(3) was announced by Preiss (1983), while a detailed proof of the implication (3)$\Rightarrow$(2) has appeared in Assouad and Quentin de Gromard (2006). The implication (2)$\Rightarrow$(1) was established by Cérou and Guyader (2006). We prove the implication (1)$\Rightarrow$(3).

<details>

Motivation: 混合专家（MoE）模型通过稀疏激活扩展能力，但增加了内存和带宽压力。现有卸载方法通过按需获取专家来缓解GPU内存问题，但token级别的路由会导致不规则传输，使推理受限于I/O。静态统一量化减少了流量，但在激进压缩下会忽略专家异构性而降低准确性。

Method: 提出了基于低秩补偿的带宽高效适配混合专家方法。该方法使用预计算的低秩补偿器进行路由器引导的精度恢复。在推理时，为每个token选择Top-n（n<k）专家传输紧凑的低秩因子，并应用补偿以恢复精度，而保持其他专家为低比特。该方法与GPU卸载系统和GPU-NDP系统集成。

Result: 该方法在带宽-准确性权衡和吞吐量方面实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过低秩补偿机制，该研究有效地解决了MoE模型在带宽受限环境下的推理效率问题，同时保持了模型准确性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale capacity via sparse activation but stress memory and bandwidth. Offloading alleviates GPU memory by fetching experts on demand, yet token-level routing causes irregular transfers that make inference I/O-bound. Static uniform quantization reduces traffic but degrades accuracy under aggressive compression by ignoring expert heterogeneity. We present Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts via Low-Rank Compensation, which performs router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators. At inference time, our method transfers compact low-rank factors with Top-n (n<k) experts per token and applies compensation to them, keeping others low-bit. Integrated with offloading on GPU and GPU-NDP systems, our method delivers a superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput.

TL;DR: 该研究表明，通过在包含故意错误的推理轨迹上进行训练，可以提升大型语言模型在数学推理中的错误检测和恢复能力，同时不降低标准问题解决性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有链式思维提示方法中，模型对早期错误非常脆弱，单个算术错误或不合理推断通常会导致最终答案错误。研究者希望探索在包含故意错误的推理轨迹上训练是否能提升模型的错误检测和恢复能力。

Method: 使用MATH竞赛级问题生成包含单一控制错误的CoT前缀（计算错误或推理错误），通过GRPO使用二元最终答案奖励对Qwen3-4B进行微调，对比研究不同错误类型的训练效果。

Result: Mixed-CoT-RL模型在干净问题上表现与标准RL相当（41% vs 41%），但在包含错误推理的问题上显著优于标准RL（24% vs 19%）。仅使用干净数据训练的RL会降低鲁棒性（19% vs 20%），混合训练在推理错误上获得最大鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: 在训练中暴露有缺陷的推理轨迹可以改善错误恢复行为而不牺牲准确性，为LLMs中更稳健的数学推理提供了可能路径。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become central to mathematical reasoning in large language models, yet models remain brittle to early errors: a single arithmetic slip or unjustified inference typically propagates uncorrected to an incorrect final answer. We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their extension as computational graphs--squared circuits--have been used as expressive distribution estimators, yet supporting closed-form marginalization. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.

Motivation: 针对具有层次结构的规划问题，传统方法在复杂环境中的适应性有限，需要更高效的规划范式融合来提升数据效率和任务成功率。

Method: 提出强化学习与MPC规划紧密结合的新方法，利用强化学习动作为MPPI采样器提供信息，自适应聚合MPPI样本进行值估计更新。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应采样策略有效融合强化学习与MPC规划，显著提高复杂规划问题的解决能力和适应性，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose a new approach for solving planning problems with a hierarchical structure, fusing reinforcement learning and MPC planning. Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.

Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have demonstrated strong performance in classifying complex time series data. However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications.

Abstract: This paper presents the first end-to-end pipeline for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for Old Nepali, a historically significant but low-resource language. We adopt a line-level transcription approach and systematically explore encoder-decoder architectures and data-centric techniques to improve recognition accuracy. Our best model achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.9\%. In addition, we implement and evaluate decoding strategies and analyze token-level confusions to better understand model behaviour and error patterns. While the dataset we used for evaluation is confidential, we release our training code, model configurations, and evaluation scripts to support further research in HTR for low-resource historical scripts.

TL;DR: 研究评估了CheXagent模型处理胸部X光图像检索中否定语句的能力，通过微调方法改善了CLIP模型对否定语言的处理，同时略微降低了正向提示的准确率，并分析了模型内部行为变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等大视觉语言模型在医疗影像任务中应用广泛，但存在解释否定语句能力不足的问题，这在医疗诊断场景中尤为重要。需要评估和改进模型处理否定临床语言的能力。

Method: 使用Stanford AIMI CheXagent模型评估带/不带否定提示的胸部X光图像检索能力，基于先前工作的微调方法改进检索准确率，并通过token attribution、t-SNE投影和attention-head ablation分析模型内部行为。

Result: 研究显示微调后CLIP模型处理否定语句的能力得到改善，但正向提示评估准确率略有下降。通过内部行为分析揭示了不同微调方法如何重塑文本编码器对否定临床语言的表示。

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于更好理解CLIP内部行为，并通过临床相关语言改进其对否定的处理能力，从而提高医疗AI设备的可靠性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出的广义原始平均（GPA）方法是一种基于Nesterov方法原始平均形式的扩展，它解决了单工作器DiLoCo和Schedule-Free等平均化优化器在内存、超参数方面的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均化优化器如单工作器DiLoCo存在内存需求大、超参数多的限制，Schedule-Free的均匀平均也有局限性。需要一种更高效、简单且理论保证强的平均化方法来提升优化器性能。

Method: 通过解耦Nesterov原始平均公式中的插值常数，GPA实现了每步对迭代的平滑平均，消除单工作器DiLoCo的双环结构，减少内存开销至单个额外缓冲区。

Result: 在Llama-160M模型上，GPA相比基线（AdamW）验证损失达到速度提升24.22%；在ImageNet ViT任务的小批量和大批量设置中，分别获得12%和27%的速度提升来达到AdamW的验证准确率。

Conclusion: GPA不仅实证上优于单工作器DiLoCo，简化了超参数调优，且理论上证明对任何具有O(√T)遗憾界的基优化器都能匹配或超越其收敛保证。

Abstract: We propose Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA), an extension of Nesterov's method in its primal averaging formulation that addresses key limitations of recent averaging-based optimizers such as single-worker DiLoCo and Schedule-Free (SF) in the non-distributed setting. These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to predict accurately over long time horizons. Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of electric vehicles as a means of addressing climate change, concerns have emerged regarding their impact on electric grid management. As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate EV charging demand forecasting across such a wide range of temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels using multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Role-playing models (RPMs) are widely used in real-world applications but underperform when deployed in the wild. This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.

TL;DR: MINPO：一个统一的记忆感知神经伪算子框架，用于高效建模由积微分方程描述的非局部时空动力学，避免传统方法对复杂核函数重复积分的计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的非局部动力学（积微分方程）求解方法需要重复计算卷积积分，成本随核函数复杂度和维度快速增加；现有神经求解器无法泛化到不同的非局部结构。需要一种统一框架来高效处理多种非局部依赖关系。

Method: 提出记忆感知神经伪算子（MINPO），使用KAN或MLP作为编码器直接学习非局部算子及其逆的神经表示，辅以轻量级的非局部一致性损失项保障算子和解之间的一致性。该框架能自然地捕获并高效求解各种IDE及其子类（包括分数阶PDE）统治的非局部时空依赖。

Result: 与经典技术、基于MLP的A-PINN/fPINN及其新开发的KAN变体A-PIKAN/fPIKAN相比，MINPO在准确性、处理不同核类型、不同核维度以及重复核积分计算的高需求方面都表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MINPO超越了问题特定公式的限制，为受非局部算子支配的系统提供了一个统一的框架，能高效且准确地建模非局部时空动力学，并为未来的神经求解器设计提供了有益的参考。

Abstract: Many physical systems exhibit nonlocal spatiotemporal behaviors described by integro-differential equations (IDEs). Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.

Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病诊断的机器学习方法面临根本性挑战：临床评估昂贵且侵入性强，导致只有小部分神经影像数据有真实标签。需要解决标注数据稀缺问题，同时利用大量未标注数据

Conclusion: 有原则的半监督学习可以释放全球积累的部分标注神经影像数据的诊断潜力，显著减少标注负担，同时保持适合临床部署的准确性

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis face a fundamental challenges. Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 论文通过因果机制验证发现上下文学习(ICL)可解耦为任务图式和绑定两个独立机制，揭示了架构通用性、先验与图式的权衡关系，并提出了实用提示工程优化方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点将上下文学习视为单一机制（检索式、梯度下降式或贝叶斯式），但缺乏对内部机制的解耦分析。需要明确验证ICL是否分解为可分离的神经机制，并探究其在不同架构中的普适性和实际应用价值

Method: 通过在9个模型（来自7个Transformer家族和Mamba架构，参数量370M-13B）上进行激活修补实验，建立了双重解耦、先验-图式权衡和架构通用性三个关键发现

Result: 1.双重解耦：任务图式通过后期MLP修补100%转移，绑定通过残差流修补62%转移，证明机制可分离
2.先验-图式权衡：图式依赖性与先验知识负相关
3.架构通用性：机制在所有测试架构（包括非Transformer的Mamba）中都有效
还发现注意机制误路由（72.7%近因偏差）而非直接输出竞争是关键瓶颈

Conclusion: 上下文学习的双过程理论得到因果证据支持：任务图式和绑定是神经可分离的独立机制。模型在先验知识缺失时依赖任务图式，而先验知识通过注意力误路由而非直接输出竞争干扰学习。这解释了为什么任意映射能成功而事实覆盖会失败，揭示了注意力而非输出层是真正瓶颈。实用意义：理解这些双重机制可优化提示工程，提高ICL系统在生产部署中的可靠性

Abstract: We provide causal mechanistic validation that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task type recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:
  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms
  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)
  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba
  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.

TL;DR: AdvJudge-Zero方法展示了大语言模型评估系统中的漏洞：低困惑度的控制令牌序列能够翻转二元判断结果，导致高误报率。通过对抗训练可以在保持评估质量的同时显著降低误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励模型和LLM-as-a-Judge系统在现代后训练流程中起着核心作用，但它们存在安全漏洞。本文旨在揭示这些系统的一个反复出现且现实的脆弱性：短序列的低困惑度控制令牌能够显著改变判断结果，这代表了在强化学习人类反馈训练中的实际奖励攻击风险。

Method: 提出AdvJudge-Zero方法，利用模型的下一个令牌分布和波束搜索探索从头发现多样化的控制令牌序列。分析发现这些序列诱导的隐藏状态扰动集中在与评估拒绝方向反对齐的低秩'软模式'中。同时展示了通过LoRA对抗训练可以在控制令牌增强的小规模数据集上显著降低误报。

Result: 实验表明，这些控制令牌在数学和推理基准上导致大型开放权重和专门化评估模型对错误答案的极高误报率。对抗训练能够在不损害评估质量的前提下显著减少这些误报。

Conclusion: LLM评估系统存在被低困惑度控制令牌操纵的脆弱性，这表明奖励攻击在实际后训练过程中是可行的风险。对抗训练是缓解这一问题的有效方法，在保持系统功能的同时增强其安全性。

Abstract: Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are central to modern post-training pipelines such as RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, where they provide scalar feedback and binary decisions that guide model selection and RL-based fine-tuning. We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) are well-suited for processing high-frequency data streams from geographically distributed sensors in smart mobility systems. However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.

Method: 1. 提出LLM-SGA框架：识别文本对抗攻击的关键不变性，确保在该框架下实例化的检测器具有强泛化能力。2. 实例化ARHOCD检测器：包含三个设计组件：(1) 集成多个基础检测器以发挥互补优势；(2) 基于样本可预测性和各基础检测器能力动态调整权重的分配方法（权重初始化使用领域知识，通过贝叶斯推理更新）；(3) 通过迭代优化基础检测器与权重分配器的新型对抗训练策略。

Result: 在涵盖仇恨言论、谣言和极端主义内容的三个数据集上评估ARHOCD，结果表明该检测器在对抗环境下具有强泛化能力并提高了检测准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的ARHOCD框架有效解决了现有对抗鲁棒性增强研究的若干局限，在对抗条件下同时实现了强泛化能力和检测准确率的提升，为社交媒体有害内容检测提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Social media platforms are plagued by harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.

Abstract: Analyzing machine learning model performance stratified by patient and recording properties is becoming the accepted norm and often yields crucial insights about important model failure modes. Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.

Motivation: 长上下文LLM推理存在注意力二次复杂度增长和KV缓存线性增长的问题。现有方法通过事后选择或淘汰来缓解，但忽视了根本低效性：无差别写入持久化内存

Method: 将KV缓存管理形式化为三个原语的因果系统：KV准入、选择和淘汰。通过Write-Gated KV实现KV准入，这是一种轻量级机制，能在token进入缓存前预测其效用性

Result: 在Llama模型上，内存使用减少46-57%，预填充速度提升3.03-3.45倍，解码速度提升1.89-2.56倍，准确率损失可忽略

Conclusion: 学习决定写入内容是实现高效长上下文推理的原理性和实用方法，Write-Gated KV与FlashAttention和分页KV系统兼容

Abstract: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

Abstract: Foundation models for protein design raise concrete biosecurity risks, yet the community lacks a simple, reproducible baseline for sequence-level hazard screening that is explicitly evaluated under homology control and runs on commodity CPUs. We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate "never-before-seen" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE. SafeBench-Seq is CPU-only, reproducible, and releases metadata only (accessions, cluster IDs, split labels), enabling rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上评估显示，相比基线前向-前向算法有显著性能改进

Conclusion: 层间协作是前向-前向学习的重要增强，适用于神经形态计算架构和能源受限AI系统

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm eliminates backpropagation's memory constraints and biological implausibility through dual forward passes with positive and negative data. However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations. These findings establish inter-layer collaboration as a fundamental enhancement to Forward-Forward learning, with immediate applicability to neuromorphic computing architectures and energy-constrained AI systems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for expensive global black-box optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

Method: 在Waymo和NuPlan数据集上系统实验，评估SRPL框架（配备未来约束违反预测模型）在不同策略优化器和数据集分布下的表现，包括零样本跨数据集评估。

Result: SRPL显著改善了奖励-安全权衡，成功率（效应量r=0.65-0.86）和成本降低（效应量r=0.70-0.83）均有统计显著提升（p<0.05），同时增强了对观测噪声的鲁棒性和跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预测性安全表示能够增强自动驾驶安全强化学习的效能，但其效果受策略优化器和数据集分布影响，展现了在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 异步协作通过模型拼接能取得竞争性结果，为数据碎片化场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be very capable at performing many real-world tasks. However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.
  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the limiting case of neural networks (NNs) architectures when the number of neurons in each hidden layer and the number of hidden layers tend to infinity thus forming a continuum, and we derive approximation errors as a function of the number of neurons and/or hidden layers. Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions. Differences and similarities with neural fields are discussed along with further possible generalizations and applications of the DiPaNet framework.

Abstract: Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a prominent paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their training strategies remain underexplored. While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE. This work provides new insights into designing hybrid training strategies to enhance the performance and robustness of PINNs.

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.

Motivation: 传统两阶段训练管道（先SFT后RL）存在关键不一致性：SFT强制刚性模仿，抑制探索并导致遗忘，限制了RL的改进潜力。这种低效性需要通过统一外部监督和自我探索的新框架来解决。

Method: TRAPO在每个训练实例中交错优化SFT损失（在专家前缀上）和RL损失（在模型自身完成上）。引入信任区域SFT（TrSFT），在信任区域内最小化前向KL散度，在区域外则衰减优化，有效转向逆向KL散度，产生稳定的、寻求模式的更新。还包含自适应的前缀选择机制，基于测量的效用分配专家指导。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试上，TRAPO始终优于标准SFT、RL、SFT-then-RL管道以及最近的最先进方法。

Conclusion: TRAPO为推理增强型大语言模型建立了强大的新范式，通过统一监督微调和强化学习，解决了传统两阶段管道的低效性问题，实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Post-training methods, especially Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), play an important role in improving large language models' (LLMs) complex reasoning abilities. However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\textbf{T}rust-\textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.

Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in Interventional Radiology and Cardiology. Therefore, we present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All used datasets as well as our training pipeline are published as open source in separate repositories.

Abstract: Selecting compact and informative gene subsets from single-cell transcriptomic data is essential for biomarker discovery, improving interpretability, and cost-effective profiling. However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical analysis of Federated SARSA (FedSARSA) with linear function approximation and local training. We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enable fast specialization of large pre-trained models to different downstream applications. However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge. We address this issue with LaLoRA, a weight-space regularization technique that applies a Laplace approximation to Low-Rank Adaptation. Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength. We further explore different loss landscape curvature approximations for estimating parameter confidence, analyze the effect of the data used for the Laplace approximation, and study robustness across hyperparameters.

Abstract: Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.

Abstract: Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is a weakly supervised framework that extends the principles of multi-instance learning (MIL) and partial-label learning (PLL) to address the challenges of inexact supervision in both instance and label spaces. However, existing MIPL approaches often suffer from poor calibration, undermining classifier reliability. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance.

Abstract: Modern Sequential Recommendation (SR) models commonly utilize modality features to represent items, motivated in large part by recent advancements in language and vision modeling. To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models currently constitute the state of the art in continuous generative modeling. These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.
  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.

Abstract: Operator learning is a data-driven approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, such as the solution operators of partial differential equations. Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.
