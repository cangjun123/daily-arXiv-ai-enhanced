Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u5bf9\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u6c47\u7f16\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u5fae\u4e4b\u5904\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5185\u5728\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6c47\u7f16\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7801\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

It supports six distinct comment styles: puns (homophones),\nrhyming, meme application, sarcasm (irony), plain humor, and content\nextraction. Powered by a multimodal large language model (MLLM), LOLGORITHM\ndirectly processes video inputs and achieves fine-grained style control through\nexplicit prompt markers and few-shot examples. To support development and\nevaluation, we construct a bilingual dataset using official APIs from Douyin\n(Chinese) and YouTube (English), covering five popular video genres: comedy\nskits, daily life jokes, funny animal clips, humorous commentary, and talk\nshows. Evaluation combines automated metrics originality, relevance, and style\nconformity with a large-scale human preference study involving 40 videos and\n105 participants. Results show that LOLGORITHM significantly outperforms\nbaseline models, achieving preference rates of over 90% on Douyin and 87.55% on\nYouTube.

We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language. Unexpectedly,\ncombining both approaches is no more effective than cultural framing with an\nEnglish prompt.

Further, we found harmful and toxic\ndepictions against women, which were more prominent for the language with the\nlargest amount of data, underscoring that quantity does not guarantee quality.\nWe hope that our work inspires further inquiry into the datasets collected for\nlow-resourced languages and prompts early mitigation of harmful content.\nWARNING: This paper contains discussion of NSFW content that some may find\ndisturbing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6027\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u63cf\u7ed8\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4f24\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Afan Oromo\u3001Amharic\u548cTigrinya\u4e09\u79cd\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6027\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u653f\u6cbb\u548c\u5b97\u6559\u6587\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5219\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u7537\u6027\u6027\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u659c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u63cf\u7ed8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u6027\u522b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u5973\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}}

Yet this assumption remains largely untested.\nExisting validation efforts rely heavily on human-judgment-based evaluations --\ntesting whether humans can distinguish AI from human output -- despite evidence\nthat such judgments are blunt and unreliable. As a result, the field lacks\nrobust tools for assessing the realism of LLM-generated text or for calibrating\nmodels to real-world data. This paper makes two contributions. First, we\nintroduce a computational Turing test: a validation framework that integrates\naggregate metrics (BERT-based detectability and semantic similarity) with\ninterpretable linguistic features (stylistic markers and topical patterns) to\nassess how closely LLMs approximate human language within a given dataset.\nSecond, we systematically compare nine open-weight LLMs across five calibration\nstrategies -- including fine-tuning, stylistic prompting, and context retrieval\n-- benchmarking their ability to reproduce user interactions on X (formerly\nTwitter), Bluesky, and Reddit. Our findings challenge core assumptions in the\nliterature. Even after calibration, LLM outputs remain clearly distinguishable\nfrom human text, particularly in affective tone and emotional expression.\nInstruction-tuned models underperform their base counterparts, and scaling up\nmodel size does not enhance human-likeness. Crucially, we identify a trade-off:\noptimizing for human-likeness often comes at the cost of semantic fidelity, and\nvice versa.

Conventional explainability techniques, such as\nSHAP, assume static data and fixed background distributions, making their\nexplanations unstable and potentially unfair when concept drift occurs. This\nstudy addresses that challenge by developing adaptive explanation frameworks\nthat recalibrate interpretability and fairness in dynamically evolving credit\nmodels. Using a multi-year credit dataset, we integrate predictive modeling via\nXGBoost with three adaptive SHAP variants: (A) per-slice explanation\nreweighting that adjusts for feature distribution shifts, (B) drift-aware SHAP\nrebaselining with sliding-window background samples, and (C) online surrogate\ncalibration using incremental Ridge regression. Each method is benchmarked\nagainst static SHAP explanations using metrics of predictive performance (AUC,\nF1), directional and rank stability (cosine, Kendall tau), and fairness\n(demographic parity and recalibration).

Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems provide a\nnatural framework for modeling decentralized control in such settings. While\nthe problem of learning in SSP has been extensively studied in single-agent\nsettings, the decentralized multi-agent variant remains largely unexplored. In\nthis work, we take a step towards addressing that gap. We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models.

Yet,\nthe computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and\nsocial interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI\nvision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos.

Building on this, In\nTraining Paired View Supervision (ITPVS) is proposed to align per Gaussian\nlogits across calibrated views during training, effectively mitigating single\nview overfitting and exposing inter view discrepancies for optimization.\nExtensive experiments on three representative benchmarks demonstrate that CaRF\nachieves average improvements of 16.8%, 4.3%, and 2.0% in mIoU over state of\nthe art methods on the Ref LERF, LERF OVS, and 3D OVS datasets, respectively.\nMoreover, this work promotes more reliable and view consistent 3D scene\nunderstanding, with potential benefits for embodied AI, AR/VR interaction, and\nautonomous perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "R3DGS\u901a\u8fc7CaRF\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b03D\u9ad8\u65af\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7ba1\u9053\u5728\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u75282D\u6e32\u67d3\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u5fae\u5206\u6846\u67b6CaRF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GFCE\u548cITPVS\u76f4\u63a5\u57283D\u9ad8\u65af\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cCaRF\u5728mIoU\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8616.8%\u30014.3%\u548c2.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To anchor research in LLF,\nhere we present two high-volume benchmark datasets-arXiv (accesses -> citations\nof 2.3M papers) and GitHub (pushes/stars -> forks of 3M repositories)-and\noutline additional domains with analogous lead-lag dynamics, including\nWikipedia (page views -> edits), Spotify (streams -> concert attendance),\ne-commerce (click-throughs -> purchases), and LinkedIn profile (views ->\nmessages). Our datasets provide ideal testbeds for lead-lag forecasting, by\ncapturing long-horizon dynamics across years, spanning the full spectrum of\noutcomes, and avoiding survivorship bias in sampling. We documented all\ntechnical details of data curation and cleaning, verified the presence of\nlead-lag dynamics through statistical and classification tests, and benchmarked\nparametric and non-parametric baselines for regression. Our study establishes\nLLF as a novel forecasting paradigm and lays an empirical foundation for its\nsystematic exploration in social and usage data.

Secondly, a unified artistic style label system with three levels\n(i.e., subjects, techniques, and emotions) is established by using large\nlanguage models, and it is further visually encoded as a new foldable nested\ndoughnut chart. Finally, a visually guided human-computer collaborative\ninteractive exploration mechanism is constructed, in which a painter cohort\nrecommendation model is designed by integrating style, identity, time, space,\nand relationships.

However, PPG signal\nquality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and\ninter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and\nclassification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects\ndemonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the\nmodel to noise and variability between subjects.

However, we show that the probe's classification accuracy alone\nis an unreliable measure of concept alignment, i.e., the degree to which a CAV\ncaptures the intended concept.

To address this severe problem, we introduce a\nnovel concept localization method based on spatial linear attribution, and\nprovide a comprehensive comparison of it to existing feature visualization\ntechniques for detecting and mitigating concept misalignment. We further\npropose three classes of metrics for quantitatively assessing concept\nalignment: hard accuracy, segmentation scores, and augmentation robustness.

In this paper, we show that batching\noffers an additional, underappreciated benefit: it regularizes model behavior\nduring multi-step reasoning for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We conduct a\ncomprehensive study across 13 diverse benchmarks and observe that batching\nimproves accuracy while substantially reducing reasoning token usage, often by\n3x-5x. Through detailed behavioral analysis, we find that batching suppresses\noverthinking, reduces hedging language (e.g., repetitive self-corrections), and\nencourages more decisive answers. Surprisingly, we also observe emergent\ncollective effects in batched inference: models often generalize patterns from\nearlier examples to solve harder ones in the same batch.

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity\ndirectly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to\ncapture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep\nrobustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and\nlinguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain\nrepresentations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned\nvisual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual\nreliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel\nuncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during\nalignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to\nenhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of\nsingle-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M\nimproves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and\ncaptioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically\nsurpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

To address these gaps, we propose a framework\nthat simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess\nthe medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate\ninquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a\ndedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725\ncontraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.\nA two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional\nquality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality\nconsultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs\nusing structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend\nsafe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current\nLLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,\nespecially when risks are implied rather than explicit.

Project page:\n  https://yhlee-add.github.io/THG", "summary": "In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free\nstrategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity\ngeneration. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance\nterm exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating\nthe classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets.

The results show that although the\nmodels achieved satisfactory scores in the knowledge test, none met the passing\nthreshold in the practical written part, and the evaluations of the\n'LLM-as-a-judge' often diverged from the judgments of the official examining\ncommittee. The authors highlight key limitations: susceptibility to\nhallucinations, incorrect citation of legal provisions, weaknesses in logical\nargumentation, and the need for close collaboration between legal experts and\ntechnical teams. The findings indicate that, despite rapid technological\nprogress, current LLMs cannot yet replace human judges or independent examiners\nin Polish public procurement adjudication.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u5170\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u4e66\u9762\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5b98\u65b9\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ce2\u5170\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0a\u8bc9\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8d44\u683c\u8003\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8003\u8bd5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e66\u9762\u90e8\u5206\u6ca1\u6709\u8fbe\u5230\u53ca\u683c\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5b98\u65b9\u8bc4\u5ba1\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5b98\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u8003\u5b98\u5728\u6ce2\u5170\u516c\u5171\u91c7\u8d2d\u88c1\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points.

Recent studies suggest that\ndiffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,\nknown as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent\nrepresentations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a\nsignal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates\nclosed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the\nlearned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.\nOperating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates\npartial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A\ntemporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a\nfeature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables\ntransparent attribution.

Under unseen conditions\n(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species\nidentification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In\ndomain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance\n(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).\n  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation\naccuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency\nanalysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model\nachieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%\nfewer labeled samples.\n  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific\nfoundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation\nefforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial\nanalysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728 herbicide \u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u519c\u4f5c\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u690d\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c herbicide \u786e\u4f24\u8bc4\u4f30\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u519c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94 herbicide \u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u635f\u4f24\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5728 herbicide \u8bd5\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a herbicide \u8bd5\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We quantify explicit uncertainty by creating an expert-validated,\nLLM-based reference ranking of common hedging phrases, and mapping each finding\nto a probability value based on this reference.

The primary issue\nlies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text\nencoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,\nwhich limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of\nprompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless\nstep instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to\nvarious pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly\nenhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module\ncalled the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden\nstates during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video\ngeneration. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can\nimplicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that\nbetter match the user's intent.

In particular, our explainable\nSR method distills a trained ``opaque'' regression model into mathematical\nexpressions that serve as explanations of its computed function.

We then evaluate the generated skeletons' performance using a\nGA-based approach to select a subset of high-quality candidates before\nincrementally merging them via a GP-based cascade procedure that preserves\ntheir original skeleton structure.

Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial\nformat, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although\nBEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through\nmultimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by\nenvironmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D\ndetection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\noutputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.\nDetection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the\nnuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera\nocclusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is\nbased only on the camera.

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails.

To address this\ngap, we introduce a theoretical analysis of the existence of SLTs within MHAs.\nWe prove that, if a randomly initialized MHA of $H$ heads and input dimension\n$d$ has the hidden dimension $O(d\\log(Hd^{3/2}))$ for the key and value, it\ncontains an SLT that approximates an arbitrary MHA with the same input\ndimension with high probability. Furthermore, by leveraging this theory for\nMHAs, we extend the SLTH to transformers without normalization layers. We\nempirically validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating that the\napproximation error between the SLT within a source model (MHA and transformer)\nand an approximate target counterpart decreases exponentially by increasing the\nhidden dimension of the source model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u5047\u8bbe\u81f3\u6ca1\u6709\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5f3a\u5f69\u7968\u7968\u636e\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002"}}

In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as\nwell as alignment with human preferences. Based on this considerations, we\nstreamline to analyze fine-grained dynamics of head, mouth, and eyebrows, as\nwell as face quality. Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by\n17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip\nsynchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and\nartifact-free details.

This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition\nbased adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for\nmulti-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term\nforecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically\nignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated\nmodules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;\na Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations\nbased on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances\nprediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network\ntraining. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates\nboth numerical and categorical features.

Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases.

To be\nbroadly useful, models operating on these data must integrate long-range\nspatial and temporal dependencies across diverse types of entities, while also\nsupporting multiple predictive tasks. However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts.

A hard stop for the implementation of rigorous conservation initiatives is\nour lack of key species data, especially occurrence data.

We present the ARETE R package, an open-source\nsoftware aiming to automate data extraction of species occurrences powered by\nlarge language models, namely using the chatGPT Application Programming\nInterface. This R package integrates all steps of the data extraction and\nvalidation process, from Optical Character Recognition to detection of outliers\nand output in tabular format. Furthermore, we validate ARETE through systematic\ncomparison between what is modelled and the work of human annotators. 3. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the approach by comparing range maps produced\nusing GBIF data and with those automatically extracted for 100 species of\nspiders. Newly extracted data allowed to expand the known Extent of Occurrence\nby a mean three orders of magnitude, revealing new areas where the species were\nfound in the past, which mayhave important implications for spatial\nconservation planning and extinction risk assessments. 4. ARETE allows faster\naccess to hitherto untapped occurrence data, a potential game changer in\nprojects requiring such data.

Classical Test Theory analysis\nreveals that 55\\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \\geq 0.40$)\nwhile 30\\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.\nQuestion 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful\ndiscriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA\nF-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance\n(0.206), accounting for 20.6\\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms\ndemonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nachieving 97.5\\% and 96.0\\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering\nidentifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\\%,\ndiverging from the institutional threshold of 55\\% and suggesting potential\noverclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits\nexceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster\npurity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:\nreplace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and\nintegrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms.
