*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICONIC-444是一个专门为OOD检测研究设计的大型工业图像数据集，包含超过310万张RGB图像和444个类别，旨在解决现有数据集在OOD类别定义、难度层次和任务粒度方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OOD检测研究的进展受到现有数据集局限性的制约，这些数据集缺乏大规模、高质量的图像数据，OOD类别定义不明确，难度层次（从近OOD到远OOD）不完整，且无法同时支持精细和粗粒度计算机视觉任务。

Method: 通过原型工业分拣机采集数据，构建ICONIC-444数据集，包含超过310万张RGB图像，涵盖444个类别。同时定义了四个参考任务来评估OOD检测方法，并为22种最先进的后处理OOD检测方法提供了基线结果。

Result: 创建了ICONIC-444数据集，这是一个专门针对OOD检测研究的大规模工业图像数据集，为评估OOD检测方法提供了结构化和多样化的数据。

Conclusion: ICONIC-444填补了现有OOD检测数据集的空白，提供了具有明确OOD类别、覆盖不同难度层次的专门数据集，能够支持严格的OOD评估和各种复杂程度的任务，将推动OOD检测研究的进一步发展。

Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.

### [2] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估GPT-4o、Florence 2和LLaVa-1.5三种领先视觉语言模型在建筑工地图像中识别工人动作和情绪的表现，发现GPT-4o在两项任务中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在建筑施工流程中的集成度提高，其理解和响应人类行为的能力对实现安全有效协作至关重要。视觉语言模型因其无需大量特定领域训练即可识别人类行为的潜力，在标注数据稀缺的建筑领域特别有吸引力。

Method: 使用包含1,000张图像的数据集（标注10种动作和10种情绪类别），通过标准化推理流程和多种评估指标评估三个模型的表现。

Result: GPT-4o在动作识别（平均F1分数0.756，准确率0.799）和情绪识别（F1分数0.712，准确率0.773）中均表现最佳。Florence 2表现中等，LLaVa-1.5表现最差。所有模型在区分语义相近类别时都存在困难。

Conclusion: 通用视觉语言模型可为建筑环境中的人类行为识别提供基础能力，但要实现实际应用的可靠性，仍需通过领域适应、时序建模或多模态感知等方法进一步改进。

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [3] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现ID准确性与OOD检测性能之间存在非线性关系：初始随准确率提升而改善，但当高精度训练方法突破基准后反而下降，且训练策略、探测器选择和OOD性能之间存在强烈相互依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OOD检测与追求ID精度最大化的现代训练流程之间的相互影响尚未充分探究，需要系统性研究这一关系以指导更可靠的机器学习系统部署。

Method: 通过固定ResNet-50架构，使用21种后处理SOTA OOD检测方法，在56个通过不同训练策略获得的ImageNet训练模型上进行评估，并在8个OOD测试集上进行测试。

Result: 揭示了ID准确性与OOD检测性能的非单调关系：初期同步提升，但高精度训练突破基准后性能下降；发现训练策略、探测器选择与OOD性能之间的强相关，无单一方法普遍最优。

Conclusion: OOD检测性能不仅取决于检测方法，还受到训练策略的显著影响，需要在模型训练时综合考虑OOD性能，而非单纯追求ID精度最大化。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [4] [Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880)
*Chongcong Jiang,Tianxingjian Ding,Chuhan Song,Jiachen Tu,Ziyang Yan,Yihua Shao,Zhenyi Wang,Yuzhang Shang,Tianyu Han,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Medical SAM3，通过对SAM3在大规模异构医·图像上进行全参数微调，构建了首个基于提示的通用医学图像分割基础模型，解决了SAM3因领域差异、缺乏空间提示和复杂解剖结构推理而难以直接应用于医学图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示型分割基础模型（如SAM3）在医学图像分割上表现出有限的应用性，主要受限于领域差异、缺少特权空间提示以及无法有效处理复杂的解剖和体素结构。这些限制导致SAM3在医学数据上性能显著下降，尤其在依赖强几何先验时。

Method: 对33个包含10种医学成像模态的数据集进行了系统分析，发现原始SAM3的性能严重依赖于几何先验（如边界框）。为解决此问题，在拥有分割掩模和文本提示的大规模异构2D和3D医学图像数据集上对SAM3进行了全参数微调，以实现领域特定表示并保持提示驱动的灵活性。

Result: 经过微调的Medical SAM3在器官、成像模态和维度上均表现出一致且显著的性能提升，特别是在语义模糊、形态复杂和长程3D上下文等具有挑战性的场景中效果显著。

Conclusion: Medical SAM3确立为一种通用的文本引导医学图像分割基础模型，突显了在严重领域偏移下实现稳健提示驱动的分割时，进行整体模型适应的重要性。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [5] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究构建了具有精细原子级、时间感知的身体部位文本标注的动作数据集，并基于此提出了FrankenMotion——一个基于扩散的、部位感知的动作生成框架，实现了对身体部位和原子动作的时空控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本提示的动作生成方法多依赖序列级或动作级描述，缺乏细粒度的部位级标注，导致难以控制单个身体部位的动作。针对这一问题，研究旨在提升动作生成的时空可控性。

Method: 1. 利用大语言模型的推理能力，构建具有原子级、时间感知的部位文本标注的高质量动作数据集；2. 提出基于扩散模型的部位感知动作生成框架FrankenMotion，其中每个身体部位由自己的时间结构文本提示引导。

Result: FrankenMotion在适应并重新训练的基线模型中表现最优，并能组合生成训练中未见过的动作。

Conclusion: 这是首个提供原子级、时间感知部位标注并实现动作生成时空控制的工作，所构建的数据集与模型将开源，有望推动细粒度可控动作生成的发展。

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

### [7] [RobuMTL: Enhancing Multi-Task Learning Robustness Against Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10921)
*Tasneem Shaffee,Sherief Reda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出RobuMTL架构，通过动态选择任务特定的分层LoRA模块和LoRA专家小组来适应视觉退化，提升多任务学习中恶劣天气条件下的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中的恶劣天气条件会严重降低多任务学习（MTL）模型的性能和可靠性，需要一种能自适应处理视觉退化的方法。

Method: 设计了RobuMTL架构，采用混合专家方式，根据输入扰动动态选择任务特定的分层LoRA模块和LoRA专家小组，实现自适应专业化。

Result: 在PASCAL数据集上，单一扰动下平均相对提升+2.8%，混合天气条件下相对提升高达+44.4%；在NYUD-v2数据集上，平均相对提升达+9.7%。

Conclusion: RobuMTL能够有效提高多任务学习模型在动态环境中的稳健性，在应对恶劣天气等视觉退化条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

*Xianliang Huang,Jiajie Gou,Shuhang Chen,Zhizhou Zhong,Jihong Guan,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个统一干扰物去除方法IDDR-NGP，可直接处理Instant-NGP，能去除多种3D场景干扰物（雪花、彩纸、落叶、花瓣等），而现有方法通常针对特定干扰物类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景干扰物去除方法通常只针对单一类型干扰物（如雪花），缺乏统一的多类型干扰物处理框架。作者旨在开发一种通用的方法，能够处理各种自然和人造干扰物，提升3D场景重建质量。

Method: 结合隐式3D表示与2D检测器，设计LPIPS损失和多视角补偿损失（MVCL）联合优化渲染结果，可聚合多视角受损图像信息，支持端到端训练。同时构建了包含合成和真实干扰物的新基准数据集。

Result: 大量实验证明IDDR-NGP能有效去除多种类型干扰物，在去雪花任务上与现有SOTA方法性能相当，并能准确去除真实和合成干扰物。

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP是首个统一的3D场景干扰物去除方法，通过隐式表示与2D检测器结合，配合专门设计的损失函数，能够处理多种干扰物类型，为隐式3D表示中的干扰物去除研究提供了新基准和有效方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

TL;DR: AIGVDBench是一个针对AI生成视频检测的综合性基准测试，覆盖31个先进生成模型、超过44万视频，对33个现有检测器执行超1500项评估，提出8个深入分析和4个新发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成视频检测领域存在两个关键限制：1）数据集规模小、生成模型过时或场景狭窄，难以捕捉现代生成技术的多样性和快速演变；2）现有基准主要停留在数据集创建阶段，缺乏对基本问题和深入分析的系统性探索。

Conclusion: AIGVDBench为推进AI生成视频检测领域提供了坚实基础，公开源代码以促进社区发展和进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.

TL;DR: 提出了物理感知的强化学习范式，首次在视频生成模型中强制应用物理碰撞规则，并扩展为完整的Mimicry-Discovery Cycle框架，构建新的物理视频生成基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的视频生成模型严重忽视物理原理，特别是在刚体运动渲染方面存在关键局限性。计算机图形学中易用的牛顿公式在现有预训练-微调范式中被丢弃，物理约束仅被视为优化过程中的次优条件，限制了视频的物理现实感

Method: 1) 提出了物理感知强化学习范式，直接在视频的高维空间强制执行物理碰撞规则，确保物理知识被严格应用而不是作为条件。2) 将其扩展为Mimicry-Discovery Cycle统一框架，允许大规模微调同时保持利用物理接地反馈的能力

Result: 构建了新的基准测试PhysRVGBench，并通过大量定性和定量实验全面评估了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该研究填补了transformer视频生成中物理原理应用的空白，通过新的强化学习范式和MDcycle框架，显著提升了生成视频的物理现实感和真实感

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

### [14] [CoDance: An Unbind-Rebind Paradigm for Robust Multi-Subject Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11096)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDance提出了一种新的Unbind-Rebind框架，用于解决多主体角色图像动画中存在的空间对齐和主体绑定问题，能够处理任意的主题数量、角色类型和空间错位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法擅长单人动画，但在处理任意主题数量、多样角色类型以及参考图像与驱动姿态之间的空间错位时表现不佳，这主要归因于过于刚性的空间绑定机制和无法准确将运动重新绑定到目标主体上。

Method: 提出Unbind-Rebind框架：Unbind模块通过姿态偏移编码器引入随机扰动，打破姿态与参考图像间的刚性空间绑定，学习位置无关的运动表示；Rebind模块利用文本提示的语义指导和主体掩码的空间指导，将学习到的运动引导至目标角色。同时创建了多主体评估基准CoDanceBench。

Result: 在CoDanceBench和现有数据集上的大量实验表明，CoDance达到了最先进的性能，在多样主体和空间布局上表现出显著的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoDance框架通过解绑-重绑机制有效解决了多主体角色动画的空间对齐和主体绑定问题，展现出了优秀的性能和泛化能力，相关代码和模型权重将开源。

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: VIGA是一个通过迭代执行与验证实现视觉反图形推理的智能体，将图像重构为可编辑的图形程序，相比一次性基准方法在多个任务和基准上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像重构为可编辑的图形程序是计算机视觉的长期目标，但现有视觉系统缺乏细粒度的空间和物理接地能力，无法一次性实现这一目标。这需要跨模态的迭代推理过程来弥补差距。

Method: 提出VIGA系统，采用闭环的编写-运行-渲染-比较-修订流程，从空白世界开始重构或编辑场景，包含技能库（生成器与验证器角色交替）和演进上下文记忆（计划、代码差异、渲染历史），任务无关且无需微调。

Result: 实验表明，VIGA在BlenderGym（提升35.32%）和SlideBench（提升117.17%）上显著优于一次性基准方法；在BlenderBench上提升124.70%，展示了其在跨模态推理和图形引擎测试中的优越性。

Conclusion: VIGA通过迭代式多模态推理成功实现了视觉反图形目标，能够处理多种任务（如3D重建、场景编辑、物理交互等），并提供了一个统一的框架来评估异构基础视觉模型。

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

TL;DR: 文章提出一种名为嵌入式无缝数据（ESD）的超轻量化30米分辨率全球地球嵌入数据库，旨在解决海量地球观测数据存储与计算难题，支持在本地工作站进行全球尺度分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星地球观测系统快速发展产生了海量数据，但全球尺度的分析面临巨大的计算和存储挑战，阻碍了行星尺度的科学研究普及。

Method: 利用Landsat系列和MODIS Terra的多传感器观测数据，通过ESDNet架构和有限标量量化（FSQ）将其转化为信息密集的量化潜在向量，压缩原始数据约340倍，将年均全球陆地表面数据压缩至约2.4TB。

Result: 验证显示高重建保真度（MAE: 0.0130；RMSE: 0.0179；CC: 0.8543）；嵌入表示在土地覆盖分类中达到79.74%的准确率（优于原始数据的76.92%），并具备强大的少样本学习能力和时间序列一致性。

Conclusion: ESD为行星尺度研究民主化和新一代地理空间人工智能发展提供了多功能基础，显著降低了全球尺度分析的门槛。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

Conclusion: BioTune能够有效解决迁移学习中的领域差异问题，通过进化优化实现了自适应微调，在多个任务和架构上表现出优越的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced image analysis across diverse domains but often depends on large, annotated datasets for success. Transfer learning addresses this challenge by utilizing pre-trained models to tackle new tasks with limited labeled data. However, discrepancies between source and target domains can hinder effective transfer learning. We introduce BioTune, a novel adaptive fine-tuning technique utilizing evolutionary optimization. BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility. Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of BioTune's key components on overall performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/davilac/BioTune.

Motivation: 针对不同场景（如分辨率变化、衣物更换等）的行人再识别系统通常需要专门的模型，缺乏统一的跨场景解决方案；希望构建能够自适应处理多种场景的统一框架。

Method: 基于CLIP预训练模型构建三阶段框架：阶段一使用场景嵌入微调图像编码器使其适应多场景；阶段二优化文本嵌入与伪标签对应，并提出多场景分离损失；阶段三使用异构匹配模块获取可靠正对，并动态更新文本表示以保持图文监督一致性。

Conclusion: ITKM框架成功地将图像-文本知识建模应用于无监督多场景行人再识别，不仅统一了不同场景的处理方式，还显著提高了系统性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution. Code and model are available at https://github.com/measty/StainQuant.git.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

TL;DR: SUG-Occ: 一种基于语义和不确定性引导的稀疏学习框架，用于3D语义占据预测，通过利用场景的固有稀疏性，在保持几何和语义完整性的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占据预测是自动驾驶领域的关键感知任务，但细粒度表示带来了高昂的计算和内存开销，阻碍了实时部署应用。为了解决这个问题，需要一种高效的方法来减少冗余计算，同时保持几何和语义的完整性。

Method: 1. 使用语义和不确定性先验在视图变换中抑制自由空间投影，并结合无符号距离编码增强几何一致性，生成结构一致的稀疏3D表示。 2. 设计级联稀疏补全模块，通过超交叉稀疏卷积和生成式上采样实现高效的从粗到细推理。 3. 提出基于对象上下文表示（OCR）的掩码解码器，聚合稀疏特征的全局语义上下文，并通过轻量级查询-上下文交互优化体素级预测，避免对体积特征进行昂贵的注意力操作。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SUG-Occ优于基线方法，准确性提高了7.34%，效率提升了57.8%。

Conclusion: SUG-Occ通过显式利用场景稀疏性和语义/不确定性先验，成功实现了高效且准确的3D语义占据预测，为自动驾驶感知任务的实际实时部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

TL;DR: WetSAM采用双分支设计的SAM框架，通过集成时间序列卫星图像和稀疏点监督实现湿地精确制图，相比现有方法有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湿地制图对生态系统监测至关重要，但密集像素级标注成本高昂，现有深度学习模型在稀疏点标注下表现不佳，季节性变化导致单时相图像不充分；SAM等基础模型缺乏时序建模能力，在湿地分割中产生碎片化结果。

Method: 提出WetSAM，基于SAM的双分支框架：时序提示分支通过分层适配器和动态时间聚合来分离湿地特征与物候变化；空间分支采用时序约束的区域生长策略生成可靠的密集伪标签；双向一致性正则化联合优化两个分支。

Result: 在八个约5000km²的全球区域进行实验，WetSAM显著超越当前最优方法，平均F1-score达85.58%，以最小标注工作量实现准确、结构一致的湿地分割。

Conclusion: WetSAM展现出强大的泛化能力和可扩展性，为实现低成本、高分辨率的全球湿地制图提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

Motivation: 现有的3D视觉语言模型在空间推理方面缺乏明确性和可解释性，难以进行精确的几何理解和关系推理。研究人员希望开发一个能够提供明确、可解释空间推理的框架，增强3D理解能力。

Method: 提出Map2Thought框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 度量认知图：结合离散网格的关系推理和连续度量尺度表示的几何理解；2) 认知链：通过向量运算、边界框距离和遮挡感知外观顺序线索等确定性操作，生成基于3D结构的可解释推理轨迹。

Conclusion: Map2Thought通过明确的几何推理和可解释的推理过程，显著提升了3D视觉语言模型的空间理解能力，特别是在少样本场景下表现优异，为可解释的3D理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

Motivation: 现有医学基础模型难以同时实现视觉理解和生成任务，因为这两个任务目标存在冲突：语义抽象与像素级重建

Method: 1. 解耦理解与生成任务：使用自回归分支进行理解，扩散分支进行生成
2. 引入跨模态自注意力机制，用理解特征动态指导生成过程
3. 结合严格的数据清洗流程和多阶段训练策略

Result: 在两个基准测试中，UniX 在理解性能上提升46.1%（Micro-F1），在生成质量上提升24.2%（FD-RadDino），仅需LLM-CXR四分之一参数

Conclusion: UniX 实现了与任务特定模型相当的性能，为医学图像理解与生成的协同提供了可扩展的范式

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

Motivation: 传统LLM在复杂推理任务中难以平衡上下文学习与计算成本，需要能够根据不确定性动态调整推理机制的自适应方法

Method: 集成上下文学习与熵引导的思维链推理，根据令牌级不确定性动态调整检索示例数量和推理路径：低不确定性时使用简洁推理最小化上下文，高不确定性时启用扩展的多路径探索

Result: 与次优算法对手进行100局游戏的实验评估显示，熵引导自适应推理将平均游戏结果从基线LLM的-11.6%提升至+9.5%（胜=+1，平=0，负=-1），同时保持较低的每个游戏查询次数

Conclusion: 令牌级熵与移动最优性呈负相关，不确定性引导的自适应推理能有效提升LLM在顺序决策环境中的表现

Abstract: We propose a novel LLM-based framework for reasoning in discrete, game-theoretic tasks, illustrated with \emph{Tic-Tac-Toe}. The method integrates in-context learning with entropy-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and adaptive context retrieval. The model dynamically adjusts both the number of retrieved examples and reasoning paths according to token-level uncertainty: concise reasoning with minimal context is used when uncertainty is low, whereas higher uncertainty triggers expanded multi-path CoT exploration. Experimental evaluation against a sub-optimal algorithmic opponent shows that entropy-aware adaptive reasoning substantially improves decision quality, increasing the average game outcome from \(-11.6\%\) with the baseline LLM to \(+9.5\%\) with entropy-guided adaptive reasoning over 100 games (win = +1, tie = 0, loss = -1), while maintaining a relatively low number of LLM queries per game. Statistical validation confirms that the improvement is significant, and correlation analysis reveals a negative association between token-level entropy and move optimality. These findings demonstrate that uncertainty-guided adaptive reasoning effectively enhances LLM performance in sequential decision-making environments.

<details>

Motivation: 全球有7000多种语言，但仅有不到100种具备足够的数字资源用于现代LLM训练，导致低资源语言使用者在模型性能、文化对齐和可访问性方面面临系统性问题。BYOL旨在弥合这一数字语言鸿沟。

Method: 1）将语言按数字足迹分为四类（极低、低、中、高资源）；2）为低资源语言设计全栈数据精炼和扩展流程：语料清洗、合成文本生成、持续预训练和监督微调；3）为极低资源语言采用翻译中介包含路径；4）通过权重空间模型合并保持英语和多语言能力。

Result: 应用于齐切瓦语和毛利语的实验显示，相比强大多语言基线获得约12%的平均提升（12个基准测试）；在因纽特语上，定制的机器翻译系统比商业基线提升4 BLEU分数；同时发布了三种语言的人类翻译版Global MMLU-Lite基准测试。

Conclusion: BYOL提供了统一、可扩展的框架，通过分层方法有效提升低资源和极低资源语言的LLM性能，同时保持现有语言能力，为减少语言数字不平等提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual capabilities, yet remain fundamentally constrained by the severe imbalance in global language resources. While over 7,000 languages are spoken worldwide, only a small subset (fewer than 100) has sufficient digital presence to meaningfully influence modern LLM training. This disparity leads to systematic underperformance, cultural misalignment, and limited accessibility for speakers of low-resource and extreme-low-resource languages. To address this gap, we introduce Bring Your Own Language (BYOL), a unified framework for scalable, language-aware LLM development tailored to each language's digital footprint. BYOL begins with a language resource classification that maps languages into four tiers (Extreme-Low, Low, Mid, High) using curated web-scale corpora, and uses this classification to select the appropriate integration pathway. For low-resource languages, we propose a full-stack data refinement and expansion pipeline that combines corpus cleaning, synthetic text generation, continual pretraining, and supervised finetuning. Applied to Chichewa and Maori, this pipeline yields language-specific LLMs that achieve approximately 12 percent average improvement over strong multilingual baselines across 12 benchmarks, while preserving English and multilingual capabilities via weight-space model merging. For extreme-low-resource languages, we introduce a translation-mediated inclusion pathway, and show on Inuktitut that a tailored machine translation system improves over a commercial baseline by 4 BLEU, enabling high-accuracy LLM access when direct language modeling is infeasible. Finally, we release human-translated versions of the Global MMLU-Lite benchmark in Chichewa, Maori, and Inuktitut, and make our codebase and models publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/byol .

Abstract: Style features such as friendly, helpful, or concise are widely used in prompts to steer the behavior of Large Language Model (LLM) conversational agents, yet their unintended side effects remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic study of cross-feature stylistic side effects. We conduct a comprehensive survey of 127 conversational agent papers from ACL Anthology and identify 12 frequently used style features. Using controlled, synthetic dialogues across task-oriented and open domain settings, we quantify how prompting for one style feature causally affects others via a pairwise LLM as a Judge evaluation framework. Our results reveal consistent and structured side effects, such as prompting for conciseness significantly reduces perceived expertise. They demonstrate that style features are deeply entangled rather than orthogonal. To support future research, we introduce CASSE (Conversational Agent Stylistic Side Effects), a dataset capturing these complex interactions. We further evaluate prompt based and activation steering based mitigation strategies and find that while they can partially restore suppressed traits, they often degrade the primary intended style. These findings challenge the assumption of faithful style control in LLMs and highlight the need for multi-objective and more principled approaches to safe, targeted stylistic steering in conversational agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities across domains, yet mechanisms underlying sophisticated reasoning remain elusive. Recent reasoning models outperform comparable instruction-tuned models on complex cognitive tasks, attributed to extended computation through longer chains of thought. Here we show that enhanced reasoning emerges not from extended computation alone, but from simulating multi-agent-like interactions -- a society of thought -- which enables diversification and debate among internal cognitive perspectives characterized by distinct personality traits and domain expertise. Through quantitative analysis and mechanistic interpretability methods applied to reasoning traces, we find that reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B exhibit much greater perspective diversity than instruction-tuned models, activating broader conflict between heterogeneous personality- and expertise-related features during reasoning. This multi-agent structure manifests in conversational behaviors, including question-answering, perspective shifts, and the reconciliation of conflicting views, and in socio-emotional roles that characterize sharp back-and-forth conversations, together accounting for the accuracy advantage in reasoning tasks. Controlled reinforcement learning experiments reveal that base models increase conversational behaviors when rewarded solely for reasoning accuracy, and fine-tuning models with conversational scaffolding accelerates reasoning improvement over base models. These findings indicate that the social organization of thought enables effective exploration of solution spaces. We suggest that reasoning models establish a computational parallel to collective intelligence in human groups, where diversity enables superior problem-solving when systematically structured, which suggests new opportunities for agent organization to harness the wisdom of crowds.

Abstract: Recent recommender systems increasingly leverage embeddings from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, such embeddings exhibit two key limitations: (1) PLMs are not explicitly optimized to produce structured and discriminative embedding spaces, and (2) their representations remain overly generic, often failing to capture the domain-specific semantics crucial for recommendation tasks. We present EncodeRec, an approach designed to align textual representations with recommendation objectives while learning compact, informative embeddings directly from item descriptions. EncodeRec keeps the language model parameters frozen during recommender system training, making it computationally efficient without sacrificing semantic fidelity. Experiments across core recommendation benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness both as a backbone for sequential recommendation models and for semantic ID tokenization, showing substantial gains over PLM-based and embedding model baselines. These results underscore the pivotal role of embedding adaptation in bridging the gap between general-purpose language models and practical recommender systems.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly used as third-party judges, yet their reliability when evaluating speakers in dialogue remains poorly understood. We show that LLMs judge identical claims differently depending on framing: the same content elicits different verdicts when presented as a statement to verify ("Is this statement correct?") versus attributed to a speaker ("Is this speaker correct?"). We call this dialogic deference and introduce DialDefer, a framework for detecting and mitigating these framing-induced judgment shifts. Our Dialogic Deference Score (DDS) captures directional shifts that aggregate accuracy obscures. Across nine domains, 3k+ instances, and four models, conversational framing induces large shifts (|DDS| up to 87pp, p < .0001) while accuracy remains stable (<2pp), with effects amplifying 2-4x on naturalistic Reddit conversations. Models can shift toward agreement (deference) or disagreement (skepticism) depending on domain -- the same model ranges from DDS = -53 on graduate-level science to +58 on social judgment. Ablations reveal that human-vs-LLM attribution drives the largest shifts (17.7pp swing), suggesting models treat disagreement with humans as more costly than with AI. Mitigation attempts reduce deference but can over-correct into skepticism, framing this as a calibration problem beyond accuracy optimization.

Abstract: Automated interlinear gloss prediction with neural networks is a promising approach to accelerate language documentation efforts. However, while state-of-the-art models like GlossLM achieve high scores on glossing benchmarks, user studies with linguists have found critical barriers to the usefulness of such models in real-world scenarios. In particular, existing models typically generate morpheme-level glosses but assign them to whole words without predicting the actual morpheme boundaries, making the predictions less interpretable and thus untrustworthy to human annotators.
  We conduct the first study on neural models that jointly predict interlinear glosses and the corresponding morphological segmentation from raw text. We run experiments to determine the optimal way to train models that balance segmentation and glossing accuracy, as well as the alignment between the two tasks. We extend the training corpus of GlossLM and pretrain PolyGloss, a family of seq2seq multilingual models for joint segmentation and glossing that outperforms GlossLM on glossing and beats various open-source LLMs on segmentation, glossing, and alignment. In addition, we demonstrate that PolyGloss can be quickly adapted to a new dataset via low-rank adaptation.

While ex-ante tests of validity (i.e., benchmarks) are often privileged in these discussions, we argue that social scientists cannot altogether avoid validating computational measures (ex-post). Replicability, in particular, is a more pressing guide for selecting language models. Being able to reliably replicate a particular finding that entails the use of a language model necessitates reliably reproducing a task. To this end, we propose starting with smaller, open models, and constructing delimited benchmarks to demonstrate the validity of the entire computational pipeline.

Abstract: The simulation of realistic clinical interactions plays a pivotal role in advancing clinical Large Language Models (LLMs) and supporting medical diagnostic education. Existing approaches and benchmarks rely on generic or LLM-generated dialogue data, which limits the authenticity and diversity of doctor-patient interactions. In this work, we propose the first Chinese patient simulation dataset (Ch-PatientSim), constructed from realistic clinical interaction scenarios to comprehensively evaluate the performance of models in emulating patient behavior. Patients are simulated based on a five-dimensional persona structure. To address issues of the persona class imbalance, a portion of the dataset is augmented using few-shot generation, followed by manual verification. We evaluate various state-of-the-art LLMs and find that most produce overly formal responses that lack individual personality. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free Multi-Stage Patient Role-Playing (MSPRP) framework, which decomposes interactions into three stages to ensure both personalization and realism in model responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across multiple dimensions of patient simulation.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练、基于推理时对数概率干预的控制生成方法，通过统计词元分数表调整解码分布，在写作复杂度、正式度和毒性三个任务上实现有效控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 统计基础的对数概率控制方法具有广泛适用性和任务无关性，能有效解决现有模型引导方法的局限性。

Abstract: Steering LLMs is essential for specialized applications such as style-sensitive text rewriting, user-adaptive communication, and toxicity mitigation. Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.

Abstract: As the cost of training large language models continues to increase and high-quality training data become increasingly scarce, selecting high-value samples or synthesizing effective training data under limited data budgets has emerged as a critical research problem. Most existing data selection methods rely on static criteria, such as difficulty, uncertainty, or heuristics, and fail to model the evolving relationship between the model and the data. Inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), we propose ZPD Detector, a data selection framework that adopts a bidirectional perspective between models and data by explicitly modeling the alignment between sample difficulty and the model's current capability. ZPD Detector integrates difficulty calibration, model capability estimation based on Item Response Theory (IRT), and a capability-difficulty matching score to dynamically identify the most informative samples at each learning stage, improving data utilization efficiency; moreover, this dynamic matching strategy provides new insights into training strategy design. All code and data will be released after our work be accepted to support reproducible researc

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅含读写动作的同步翻译策略无法充分应对实时约束下的高质量翻译需求，特别是需要在保持语义忠实的同时进行结构重组、省略和简化操作。

Method: 扩展同步翻译动作为四类自适应动作：句子切分、删除、部分概括和代词化；基于大语言模型框架实现动作自适应，并通过动作感知提示构建训练参考；开发时延感知的TTS流水线评估语义质量和单调性。

Result: 在三个英汉、英德、英日翻译基准测试中，该框架在语义指标上持续提升，相比参考翻译和现有方法延迟更低；删除和句子切分动作组合能在流畅性和延迟之间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 扩展基于大语言模型的同步翻译动作空间为解决人机口译差距提供了有前景的方向，自适应动作能有效提升实时翻译质量。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations under strict real-time constraints, which traditional policies with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space of SiMT with four adaptive actions: Sentence_Cut, Drop, Partial_Summarization and Pronominalization, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We adapt these actions in a large language model (LLM) framework and construct training references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and word-level monotonicity, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60 English-Chinese, English-German and English-Japanese benchmarks show that our framework consistently improves semantic metrics and achieves lower delay compared to reference translations and salami-based baselines. Notably, combining Drop and Sentence_Cut leads to consistent improvements in the balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

Motivation: 检索增强生成(RAG)被广泛用于提升大型语言模型的真实性，但在存在噪声检索上下文的场景中，模型置信度校准效果差——矛盾或不相关证据会引发虚假自信和严重过度自信。

Conclusion: NAACL通过弥合检索噪声与语言校准之间的差距，为实现准确且认知可靠的大型语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurately assessing model confidence is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in mission-critical factual domains. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is widely adopted to improve grounding, confidence calibration in RAG settings remains poorly understood. We conduct a systematic study across four benchmarks, revealing that LLMs exhibit poor calibration performance due to noisy retrieved contexts. Specifically, contradictory or irrelevant evidence tends to inflate the model's false certainty, leading to severe overconfidence. To address this, we propose NAACL Rules (Noise-AwAre Confidence CaLibration Rules) to provide a principled foundation for resolving overconfidence under noise. We further design NAACL, a noise-aware calibration framework that synthesizes supervision from about 2K HotpotQA examples guided by these rules. By performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with this data, NAACL equips models with intrinsic noise awareness without relying on stronger teacher models. Empirical results show that NAACL yields substantial gains, improving ECE scores by 10.9% in-domain and 8.0% out-of-domain. By bridging the gap between retrieval noise and verbal calibration, NAACL paves the way for both accurate and epistemically reliable LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently exhibit strong translation abilities, even without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the internal mechanisms governing this innate capability remain largely opaque. To demystify this process, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduce a novel framework for identifying task-specific features. Our method first recalls features that are frequently co-activated on translation inputs and then filters them for functional coherence using a PCA-based consistency metric. This framework successfully isolates a small set of **translation initiation** features. Causal interventions demonstrate that amplifying these features steers the model towards correct translation, while ablating them induces hallucinations and off-task outputs, confirming they represent a core component of the model's innate translation competency. Moving from analysis to application, we leverage this mechanistic insight to propose a new data selection strategy for efficient fine-tuning. Specifically, we prioritize training on **mechanistically hard** samples-those that fail to naturally activate the translation initiation features. Experiments show this approach significantly improves data efficiency and suppresses hallucinations. Furthermore, we find these mechanisms are transferable to larger models of the same family. Our work not only decodes a core component of the translation mechanism in LLMs but also provides a blueprint for using internal model mechanism to create more robust and efficient models. The codes are available at https://github.com/flamewei123/AAAI26-translation-Initiation-Features.

Motivation: 尽管机制可解释性研究识别了负责从上下文中检索信息的检索头，但这些检索头如何影响模型性能尚未得到探索。本研究旨在探究是否能利用检索头来增强语言模型的长文本处理能力。

Method: 提出RetMask方法：1）通过对比正常模型输出与掩码检索头的消减变体的输出生成训练信号；2）这种基于机制的方法在Llama-3.1等模型上进行实验验证；3）研究考察不同模型家族中检索头组织模式的影响。

Conclusion: 研究证实检索头在长文本处理中具有关键作用，验证了机制可解释性研究发现的可靠性，并证明可以通过机制洞察实现性能提升。不同模型家族的效果差异表明检索头组织模式对方法有效性有重要影响。

Abstract: Advances in mechanistic interpretability have identified special attention heads, known as retrieval heads, that are responsible for retrieving information from the context. However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.

Conclusion: 在有限计算预算下，随时推理框架结合自改进方法能有效提升LLMs的推理效果和效率。

Abstract: We study the reasoning behavior of large language models (LLMs) under limited computation budgets. In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.

Conclusion: 预训练权重的主导奇异方向是模型能力的关键，保护这些方向可以稳定序列知识编辑，避免通用能力退化，表明基于谱分析的编辑方法具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Sequential knowledge editing in large language models often causes catastrophic collapse of the model's general abilities, especially for parameter-modifying methods. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through heuristic constraints on parameter updates, yet the mechanisms underlying such degradation remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of sequential knowledge editing and show that a model's general abilities are closely associated with dominant singular directions of pretrained weight matrices. These directions are highly sensitive to perturbations and are progressively disrupted by repeated edits, closely tracking the collapse in both editing efficacy and general performance. Building on this insight, we propose REVIVE, a plug-and-play framework that stabilizes sequential editing by explicitly preserving the dominant singular subspace. REVIVE represents parameter updates in the spectral basis of the original weights and filters components that would interfere with the protected region. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that REVIVE consistently improves editing efficacy while substantially preserving general abilities under long-horizon sequential editing, including extreme settings with up to 20,000 edits.

Conclusion: CoG框架通过模拟直觉与审慎的相互作用，有效解决了知识图谱增强LLM的认知刚性问题，提升了推理性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities but often grapple with reliability challenges like hallucinations. While Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer explicit grounding, existing paradigms of KG-augmented LLMs typically exhibit cognitive rigidity--applying homogeneous search strategies that render them vulnerable to instability under neighborhood noise and structural misalignment leading to reasoning stagnation. To address these challenges, we propose CoG, a training-free framework inspired by Dual-Process Theory that mimics the interplay between intuition and deliberation. First, functioning as the fast, intuitive process, the Relational Blueprint Guidance module leverages relational blueprints as interpretable soft structural constraints to rapidly stabilize the search direction against noise. Second, functioning as the prudent, analytical process, the Failure-Aware Refinement module intervenes upon encountering reasoning impasses. It triggers evidence-conditioned reflection and executes controlled backtracking to overcome reasoning stagnation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that CoG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: We present a convolutional neural network approach for classifying proper names by language and entity type. Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can now solve entire exams directly from uploaded PDF assessments, raising urgent concerns about academic integrity and the reliability of grades and credentials. Existing watermarking techniques either operate at the token level or assume control over the model's decoding process, making them ineffective when students query proprietary black-box systems with instructor-provided documents. We present Integrity Shield, a document-layer watermarking system that embeds schema-aware, item-level watermarks into assessment PDFs while keeping their human-visible appearance unchanged. These watermarks consistently prevent MLLMs from answering shielded exam PDFs and encode stable, item-level signatures that can be reliably recovered from model or student responses. Across 30 exams spanning STEM, humanities, and medical reasoning, Integrity Shield achieves exceptionally high prevention (91-94% exam-level blocking) and strong detection reliability (89-93% signature retrieval) across four commercial MLLMs. Our demo showcases an interactive interface where instructors upload an exam, preview watermark behavior, and inspect pre/post AI performance & authorship evidence.

Abstract: Crawling national top-level domains has proven to be highly effective for collecting texts in less-resourced languages. This approach has been recently used for South Slavic languages and resulted in the largest general corpora for this language group: the CLASSLA-web 1.0 corpora. Building on this success, we established a continuous crawling infrastructure for iterative national top-level domain crawling across South Slavic and related webs. We present the first outcome of this crawling infrastructure - the CLASSLA-web 2.0 corpus collection, with substantially larger web corpora containing 17.0 billion words in 38.1 million texts in seven languages: Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serbian, and Slovenian. In addition to genre categories, the new version is also automatically annotated with topic labels. Comparing CLASSLA-web 2.0 with its predecessor reveals that only one-fifth of the texts overlap, showing that re-crawling after just two years yields largely new content. However, while the new web crawls bring growing gains, we also notice growing pains - a manual inspection of top domains reveals a visible degradation of web content, as machine-generated sites now contribute a significant portion of texts.

Abstract: Online disinformation poses an escalating threat to society, driven increasingly by the rapid spread of misleading content across both multimedia and multilingual platforms. While automated fact-checking methods have advanced in recent years, their effectiveness remains constrained by the scarcity of datasets that reflect these real-world complexities. To address this gap, we first present MultiCaption, a new dataset specifically designed for detecting contradictions in visual claims. Pairs of claims referring to the same image or video were labeled through multiple strategies to determine whether they contradict each other. The resulting dataset comprises 11,088 visual claims in 64 languages, offering a unique resource for building and evaluating misinformation-detection systems in truly multimodal and multilingual environments. We then provide comprehensive experiments using transformer-based architectures, natural language inference models, and large language models, establishing strong baselines for future research. The results show that MultiCaption is more challenging than standard NLI tasks, requiring task-specific finetuning for strong performance. Moreover, the gains from multilingual training and testing highlight the dataset's potential for building effective multilingual fact-checking pipelines without relying on machine translation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Output diversity is crucial for Large Language Models as it underpins pluralism and creativity. In this work, we reveal that controlling the language used during model thinking-the language of thought-provides a novel and structural source of output diversity. Our preliminary study shows that different thinking languages occupy distinct regions in a model's thinking space. Based on this observation, we study two repeated sampling strategies under multilingual thinking-Single-Language Sampling and Mixed-Language Sampling-and conduct diversity evaluation on outputs that are controlled to be in English, regardless of the thinking language used. Across extensive experiments, we demonstrate that switching the thinking language from English to non-English languages consistently increases output diversity, with a clear and consistent positive correlation such that languages farther from English in the thinking space yield larger gains. We further show that aggregating samples across multiple thinking languages yields additional improvements through compositional effects, and that scaling sampling with linguistic heterogeneity expands the model's diversity ceiling. Finally, we show that these findings translate into practical benefits in pluralistic alignment scenarios, leading to broader coverage of cultural knowledge and value orientations in LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in knowledge-intensive applications but often generate factually incorrect responses. A promising approach to rectify these flaws is correcting LLMs using feedback. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce FactCorrector, a new post-hoc correction method that adapts across domains without retraining and leverages structured feedback about the factuality of the original response to generate a correction. To support rigorous evaluations of factuality correction methods, we also develop the VELI5 benchmark, a novel dataset containing systematically injected factual errors and ground-truth corrections. Experiments on VELI5 and several popular long-form factuality datasets show that the FactCorrector approach significantly improves factual precision while preserving relevance, outperforming strong baselines. We release our code at https://ibm.biz/factcorrector.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are effective for data augmentation in classification tasks like intent detection. In some cases, they inadvertently produce examples that are ambiguous with regard to untargeted classes. We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.

TL;DR: RT-RAG通过结构化推理树和自底向上遍历显著改进RAG在复杂多跳QA中的性能，相比SOTA提升7.0% F1和6.0% EM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于RAG的迭代方法在多跳QA中存在推理不连贯和错误传播问题，主要源于不准确的查询分解。需要一种更系统的方法来处理复杂多步探索路径。

Method: RT-RAG首先通过结构化实体分析和基于共识的树状选择，将多跳问题分解为显式推理树，明确分离核心查询、已知实体和未知实体。随后采用自底向上的遍历策略，通过迭代查询重写和精化来收集高质量证据，从而减少错误传播。

Result: 在综合实验中，RT-RAG相比最先进方法显著提升7.0% F1和6.0% EM，证明了其在复杂多跳QA中的有效性。

Conclusion: RT-RAG框架通过结构化推理树分解和自底向上证据收集机制，有效解决传统迭代方法中的推理连贯性和错误传播问题，显著提升了复杂多跳QA的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant effectiveness in enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex multi-hop question answering (QA). For multi-hop QA tasks, current iterative approaches predominantly rely on LLMs to self-guide and plan multi-step exploration paths during retrieval, leading to substantial challenges in maintaining reasoning coherence across steps from inaccurate query decomposition and error propagation. To address these issues, we introduce Reasoning Tree Guided RAG (RT-RAG), a novel hierarchical framework for complex multi-hop QA. RT-RAG systematically decomposes multi-hop questions into explicit reasoning trees, minimizing inaccurate decomposition through structured entity analysis and consensus-based tree selection that clearly separates core queries, known entities, and unknown entities. Subsequently, a bottom-up traversal strategy employs iterative query rewriting and refinement to collect high-quality evidence, thereby mitigating error propagation. Comprehensive experiments show that RT-RAG substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.0% F1 and 6.0% EM, demonstrating the effectiveness of RT-RAG in complex multi-hop QA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping automated fact-checking (AFC) by enabling unified, end-to-end verification pipelines rather than isolated components. While large proprietary models achieve strong performance, their closed weights, complexity, and high costs limit sustainability. Fine-tuning smaller open weight models for individual AFC tasks can help but requires multiple specialized models resulting in high costs. We propose \textbf{multi-task learning (MTL)} as a more efficient alternative that fine-tunes a single model to perform claim detection, evidence ranking, and stance detection jointly. Using small decoder-only LLMs (e.g., Qwen3-4b), we explore three MTL strategies: classification heads, causal language modeling heads, and instruction-tuning, and evaluate them across model sizes, task orders, and standard non-LLM baselines. While multitask models do not universally surpass single-task baselines, they yield substantial improvements, achieving up to \textbf{44\%}, \textbf{54\%}, and \textbf{31\%} relative gains for claim detection, evidence re-ranking, and stance detection, respectively, over zero-/few-shot settings. Finally, we also provide practical, empirically grounded guidelines to help practitioners apply MTL with LLMs for automated fact-checking.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型成员推理攻击方法要么依赖模型内部信息（如logits）难以获取，要么在严格的仅文本黑盒设置下跨领域泛化能力差。需要开发在仅文本黑盒环境下鲁棒的MIA工具来审计LLM的训练数据。

Method: 提出了SimMIA框架，采用先进的采样策略和评分机制，专门为仅文本黑盒设置设计。同时构建了WikiMIA-25基准，用于评估现代专有LLM上的MIA性能。

Result: 实验表明，SimMIA在黑盒设置中达到了最先进的性能，结果可与利用模型内部信息的基线方法相媲美。

Conclusion: SimMIA在仅使用生成文本的黑盒设置下实现了强大的成员推理攻击性能，且WikiMIA-25基准为评估现代专有LLM的隐私泄露提供了新的评估框架。

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) act as a crucial auditing tool for the opaque training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing techniques predominantly rely on inaccessible model internals (e.g., logits) or suffer from poor generalization across domains in strict black-box settings where only generated text is available. In this work, we propose SimMIA, a robust MIA framework tailored for this text-only regime by leveraging an advanced sampling strategy and scoring mechanism. Furthermore, we present WikiMIA-25, a new benchmark curated to evaluate MIA performance on modern proprietary LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that SimMIA achieves state-of-the-art results in the black-box setting, rivaling baselines that exploit internal model information.

Abstract: Spoken conversational systems require more than accurate speech generation to have human-like conversations: to feel natural and engaging, they must produce conversational behaviour that adapts dynamically to the context. Current spoken conversational systems, however, rarely allow such customization, limiting their naturalness and usability. In this work, we present the first open, instruction-following full-duplex conversational speech model that can be trained efficiently under typical academic resource constraints. By keeping the audio encoder frozen and finetuning only the language model, our model requires just 2,000 hours of data, without relying on large-scale pretraining or multi-stage optimization. The model can follow explicit instructions to control speaker voice, conversation topic, conversational behaviour (e.g., backchanneling and interruptions), and dialogue initiation. We propose a single-stage training protocol and systematically analyze design choices. Both the model and training code will be released to enable reproducible research on controllable full-duplex speech systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在程序设计竞赛问题上的评估混淆了算法推理和代码实现，而程序设计竞赛本质上是一个问题解决任务，因此需要将问题解决与实现分离以更准确地评估模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出在生成代码之前先生成自然语言社论（问题解决方案描述），并基于社论进行评估。引入了一个包含83个ICPC风格问题、黄金社论和完整测试套件的数据集，使用专家注释比较模型生成的社论与黄金标准，并验证了基于LLM作为裁判的可扩展评估协议。

Result: 在生成代码之前生成社论可以提高某些LLM的解题率，特别是使用专家编写的黄金社论时提升更为显著。然而，即使有了黄金社论，模型在代码实现方面仍然存在困难。同时，模型生成的社论与黄金社论之间的差距揭示了在指定正确完整算法方面存在持续的问题解决瓶颈。

Conclusion: 程序设计竞赛的未来基准应该明确分离问题解决和实现，将自然语言社论作为解决方案生成和评估的核心，并提出了一个基于社论的评估框架和数据集来支持这一方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps sequentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse superior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard outputs. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that optimizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning benchmarks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in drafting responses to patient portal messages, yet their integration into clinical workflows raises various concerns, including whether they would actually save clinicians time and effort in their portal workload. We investigate LLM alignment with individual clinicians through a comprehensive evaluation of the patient message response drafting task. We develop a novel taxonomy of thematic elements in clinician responses and propose a novel evaluation framework for assessing clinician editing load of LLM-drafted responses at both content and theme levels. We release an expert-annotated dataset and conduct large-scale evaluations of local and commercial LLMs using various adaptation techniques including thematic prompting, retrieval-augmented generation, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. Our results reveal substantial epistemic uncertainty in aligning LLM drafts with clinician responses. While LLMs demonstrate capability in drafting certain thematic elements, they struggle with clinician-aligned generation in other themes, particularly question asking to elicit further information from patients. Theme-driven adaptation strategies yield improvements across most themes. Our findings underscore the necessity of adapting LLMs to individual clinician preferences to enable reliable and responsible use in patient-clinician communication workflows.

Abstract: Scientific writing is an expert-domain task that demands deep domain knowledge, task-specific requirements and reasoning capabilities that leverage the domain knowledge to satisfy the task specifications. While scientific text generation has been widely studied, its evaluation remains a challenging and open problem. It is critical to develop models that can be reliably deployed for evaluating diverse open-ended scientific writing tasks while adhering to their distinct requirements. However, existing LLM-based judges and reward models are primarily optimized for general-purpose benchmarks with fixed scoring rubrics and evaluation criteria. Consequently, they often fail to reason over sparse knowledge of scientific domains when interpreting task-dependent and multi-faceted criteria. Moreover, fine-tuning for each individual task is costly and impractical for low-resource settings. To bridge these gaps, we propose cost-efficient, open-source reward models tailored for scientific writing evaluation. We introduce a two-stage training framework that initially optimizes scientific evaluation preferences and then refines reasoning capabilities. Our multi-aspect evaluation design and joint training across diverse tasks enable fine-grained assessment and robustness to dynamic criteria and scoring rubrics. Experimental analysis shows that our training regime strongly improves LLM-based scientific writing evaluation. Our models generalize effectively across tasks and to previously unseen scientific writing evaluation settings, allowing a single trained evaluator to be reused without task-specific retraining.

Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential in recruitment applications, where decisions require reasoning over unstructured text, balancing multiple criteria, and inferring fit and competence from indirect productivity signals. Yet, it is still uncertain how LLMs assign importance to each attribute and whether such assignments are in line with economic principles, recruiter preferences or broader societal norms. We propose a framework to evaluate an LLM's decision logic in recruitment, by drawing on established economic methodologies for analyzing human hiring behavior. We build synthetic datasets from real freelancer profiles and project descriptions from a major European online freelance marketplace and apply a full factorial design to estimate how a LLM weighs different match-relevant criteria when evaluating freelancer-project fit. We identify which attributes the LLM prioritizes and analyze how these weights vary across project contexts and demographic subgroups. Finally, we explain how a comparable experimental setup could be implemented with human recruiters to assess alignment between model and human decisions. Our findings reveal that the LLM weighs core productivity signals, such as skills and experience, but interprets certain features beyond their explicit matching value. While showing minimal average discrimination against minority groups, intersectional effects reveal that productivity signals carry different weights between demographic groups.

Abstract: Hallucination is a central failure mode in large language models (LLMs). We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.

This result addresses ongoing controversies regarding how to best think of what LLMs are doing: are they a language mimic, a database, a blurry version of the Web? The ability of LLMs to recover meaning from structural patterns speaks to the unreasonable effectiveness of pattern-matching. Pattern-matching is not an alternative to "real" intelligence, but rather a key ingredient.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for enhancing large language models' question-answering capabilities through the integration of external knowledge. However, when adapting RAG systems to specialized domains, challenges arise from distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance. In this work, we propose TTARAG, a test-time adaptation method that dynamically updates the language model's parameters during inference to improve RAG system performance in specialized domains. Our method introduces a simple yet effective approach where the model learns to predict retrieved content, enabling automatic parameter adjustment to the target domain. Through extensive experiments across six specialized domains, we demonstrate that TTARAG achieves substantial performance improvements over baseline RAG systems.

Motivation: 在生成式AI时代，即使是关键的医疗任务也日益自动化，而放射学报告生成（RRG）仍依赖次优的度量指标进行质量评估。开发领域特定的指标一直是活跃的研究领域，但由于缺乏统一的、定义完善的框架来评估其在临床背景下的鲁棒性和适用性，这仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出了CTest-Metric框架，包含三个模块来评估CT RRG指标的临床可行性：写作风格泛化性（WSG）测试、合成错误注入（SEI）测试、指标vs专家相关性（MvE）测试。使用七个基于CT-CLIP编码器的LLM构建，评估了八个常用指标。

Result: 研究发现：词汇层面的NLG指标对风格变化高度敏感；GREEN Score与专家判断最一致（Spearman~0.70），而CRG呈负相关性；BERTScore-F1对事实错误注入最不敏感。

Conclusion: CTest-Metric框架为统一评估放射学报告生成指标的临床可行性提供了工具，发现不同指标在风格变化、错误检测和专家一致性方面表现各异，将发布框架、代码和允许的部分匿名评估数据以促进可复现的基准测试。

Abstract: In the generative AI era, where even critical medical tasks are increasingly automated, radiology report generation (RRG) continues to rely on suboptimal metrics for quality assessment. Developing domain-specific metrics has therefore been an active area of research, yet it remains challenging due to the lack of a unified, well-defined framework to assess their robustness and applicability in clinical contexts. To address this, we present CTest-Metric, a first unified metric assessment framework with three modules determining the clinical feasibility of metrics for CT RRG. The modules test: (i) Writing Style Generalizability (WSG) via LLM-based rephrasing; (ii) Synthetic Error Injection (SEI) at graded severities; and (iii) Metrics-vs-Expert correlation (MvE) using clinician ratings on 175 "disagreement" cases. Eight widely used metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore-F1, F1-RadGraph, RaTEScore, GREEN Score, CRG) are studied across seven LLMs built on a CT-CLIP encoder. Using our novel framework, we found that lexical NLG metrics are highly sensitive to stylistic variations; GREEN Score aligns best with expert judgments (Spearman~0.70), while CRG shows negative correlation; and BERTScore-F1 is least sensitive to factual error injection. We will release the framework, code, and allowable portion of the anonymized evaluation data (rephrased/error-injected CT reports), to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and future metric development.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) produce a textual chain of thought (CoT) in the process of solving a problem, which serves as a potentially powerful tool to understand the problem by surfacing a human-readable, natural-language explanation. However, it is unclear whether these explanations generalize, i.e. whether they capture general patterns about the underlying problem rather than patterns which are esoteric to the LRM. This is a crucial question in understanding or discovering new concepts, e.g. in AI for science. We study this generalization question by evaluating a specific notion of generalizability: whether explanations produced by one LRM induce the same behavior when given to other LRMs. We find that CoT explanations often exhibit this form of generalization (i.e. they increase consistency between LRMs) and that this increased generalization is correlated with human preference rankings and post-training with reinforcement learning. We further analyze the conditions under which explanations yield consistent answers and propose a straightforward, sentence-level ensembling strategy that improves consistency. Taken together, these results prescribe caution when using LRM explanations to yield new insights and outline a framework for characterizing LRM explanation generalization.

Motivation: 目前token被用作比较模型、估算推理成本的稳定单位，但不同模型和文本领域的token化方式存在显著差异，这使基于token的简单比较存在问题。研究旨在量化评估token化在实际使用中的变异程度。

Method: 通过全面的实证分析，探索不同文本数据分布下序列被压缩为token的情况，考察token化在不同模型和文本领域中的变化。

Result: 研究发现token化在不同模型和文本领域中存在显著变化，现有的token长度经验法则过于简化，不足以准确反映实际情况。量化分析揭示了token化在实际应用中的多样性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了关于token长度的常见经验法则，认为当前对token作为稳定比较单位的假设存在不足。建议未来使用和比较LLM时需考虑token化差异，这对更准确地进行模型比较和成本估算有重要意义。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are increasingly utilised across academia, society and industry. A commonly used unit for comparing models, their inputs and outputs, and estimating inference pricing is the token. In general, tokens are used as a stable currency, assumed to be broadly consistent across tokenizers and contexts, enabling direct comparisons. However, tokenization varies significantly across models and domains of text, making naive interpretation of token counts problematic. We quantify this variation by providing a comprehensive empirical analysis of tokenization, exploring the compression of sequences to tokens across different distributions of textual data. Our analysis challenges commonly held heuristics about token lengths, finding them to be overly simplistic. We hope the insights of our study add clarity and intuition toward tokenization in contemporary LLMs.

### [81] [TANDEM: Temporal-Aware Neural Detection for Multimodal Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11178)
*Girish A. Koushik,Helen Treharne,Diptesh Kanojia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TANDEM框架将音视频仇恨检测从二元分类转为结构化推理问题，通过视觉-语言和音频-语言模型的协同强化学习实现精准的时间定位和目标身份识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体长篇多模态内容中的有害叙事往往通过音视频和文本的复杂交互来构建。虽然自动系统能高精度识别仇恨言论，但它们通常是'黑箱'系统，无法为人工审核提供可解释的精确证据（如时间戳和目标身份）。

Method: 提出了TANDEM统一框架，采用创新的串联强化学习策略，让视觉-语言和音频-语言模型通过自约束跨模态上下文相互优化，在扩展时间序列上进行稳定推理，且无需密集的帧级监督。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，TANDEM显著优于零样本和上下文增强基线，在HateMM数据集上目标识别F1得分达到0.73（比现有最好技术提高30%），同时保持精确的时间定位。二元检测虽然稳健，但在多类别设置中区分冒犯性和仇恨性内容依然因标签模糊和数据集不平衡而具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在复杂的多模态环境中也能实现结构化的可解释对齐，这为下一代透明且可操作的在线安全审核工具提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly dominated by long-form multimodal content, where harmful narratives are constructed through a complex interplay of audio, visual, and textual cues. While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.

Abstract: Perceived trustworthiness underpins how users navigate online information, yet it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs),increasingly embedded in search, recommendation, and conversational systems, represent this construct in psychologically coherent ways. We analyze how instruction-tuned LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral 7B) encode perceived trustworthiness in web-like narratives using the PEACE-Reviews dataset annotated for cognitive appraisals, emotions, and behavioral intentions. Across models, systematic layer- and head-level activation differences distinguish high- from low-trust texts, revealing that trust cues are implicitly encoded during pretraining. Probing analyses show linearly de-codable trust signals and fine-tuning effects that refine rather than restructure these representations. Strongest associations emerge with appraisals of fairness, certainty, and accountability-self -- dimensions central to human trust formation online. These findings demonstrate that modern LLMs internalize psychologically grounded trust signals without explicit supervision, offering a representational foundation for designing credible, transparent, and trust-worthy AI systems in the web ecosystem.

*Ross Chu,Yuting Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文开发了AI智能体帮助求职者改进专业社区中的职位推荐请求写作。包含改写请求的改进智能体和评估质量的评估智能体，能提升较弱请求的预测成功率而不影响优秀请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业社区如LinkedIn中，有效的推荐请求能提高获得推荐的机会。传统方式依赖个人写作能力，AI可以帮助优化这些请求，特别是帮助写作能力较弱者提升请求质量。

Method: 使用改进智能体（LLM）改写推荐请求；评估智能体通过训练预测模型评估改写质量；结合检索增强生成（RAG）防止对优秀请求的负面修改。

Result: LLM改进使较弱请求的预测成功率显著提升（14%），优秀请求成功率不受影响。RAG防止了对优秀请求的负面修改。

Conclusion: AI智能体能有效优化推荐请求，提供低成本的质量提升信号，为后续真人实验提供基础。模型预测改进虽不能保证实际推荐增加，但提供了有价值的优化方向。

Abstract: This paper develops AI agents that help job seekers write effective requests for job referrals in a professional online community. The basic workflow consists of an improver agent that rewrites the referral request and an evaluator agent that measures the quality of revisions using a model trained to predict the probability of receiving referrals from other users. Revisions suggested by the LLM (large language model) increase predicted success rates for weaker requests while reducing them for stronger requests. Enhancing the LLM with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prevents edits that worsen stronger requests while it amplifies improvements for weaker requests. Overall, using LLM revisions with RAG increases the predicted success rate for weaker requests by 14\% without degrading performance on stronger requests. Although improvements in model-predicted success do not guarantee more referrals in the real world, they provide low-cost signals for promising features before running higher-stakes experiments on real users.

TL;DR: 本文提出了受约束时间分层架构来改进多时间尺度智能体架构，通过结构化约束恢复协调稳定性，显著减少故障级联并提升样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多时间尺度智能体架构虽能提升性能，但破坏了统一智能体系统的协调稳定性，导致层间冲突、无限错误传播和可扩展性受限。

Method: 提出受约束时间分层架构，包含三个关键约束：消息契约约束（规范层间信息流）、权威流形约束（限定各层决策空间）和仲裁解决约束（确保多层决策无冲突组合）。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效执行复杂任务，减少47%的故障级联，样本效率提升2.3倍，并具有更好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架作为时间分层架构的原则性扩展，有助于深入理解多智能体协调，为构建鲁棒自主系统指明方向。

Abstract: Recently, multi-time-scale agent architectures have extended the ubiquitous single-loop paradigm by introducing temporal hierarchies with distinct cognitive layers. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.

Abstract: An ideal embodied agent should possess lifelong learning capabilities to handle long-horizon and complex tasks, enabling continuous operation in general environments. This not only requires the agent to accurately accomplish given tasks but also to leverage long-term episodic memory to optimize decision-making. However, existing mainstream one-shot embodied tasks primarily focus on task completion results, neglecting the crucial process of exploration and memory utilization. To address this, we propose Long-term Memory Embodied Exploration (LMEE), which aims to unify the agent's exploratory cognition and decision-making behaviors to promote lifelong learning.We further construct a corresponding dataset and benchmark, LMEE-Bench, incorporating multi-goal navigation and memory-based question answering to comprehensively evaluate both the process and outcome of embodied exploration. To enhance the agent's memory recall and proactive exploration capabilities, we propose MemoryExplorer, a novel method that fine-tunes a multimodal large language model through reinforcement learning to encourage active memory querying. By incorporating a multi-task reward function that includes action prediction, frontier selection, and question answering, our model achieves proactive exploration. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art embodied exploration models demonstrate that our approach achieves significant advantages in long-horizon embodied tasks.

Abstract: This paper investigates complex product-innovation processes using models grounded in a set of heuristics. Each heuristic is expressed through simple trends -- increasing, decreasing, or constant -- which serve as minimally information-intensive quantifiers, avoiding reliance on numerical values or rough sets. A solution to a trend model is defined as a set of scenarios with possible transitions between them, represented by a transition graph. Any possible future or past behaviour of the system under study can thus be depicted by a path within this graph.

TL;DR: NeurIPS 2025 DCVLR挑战赛研究：在固定模型和训练协议下，通过基于难度的数据筛选策略构建小型数据集，获得最佳性能，揭示了数据对齐和难度筛选在数据高效多模态推理中的核心作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索在固定模型和训练协议的多模态推理场景下，数据选择策略如何影响性能，特别是分析不同数据筛选方法对模型效果的影响。

Method: 主要使用了基于难度的样本选择方法，从一个对齐的基础数据集（主要是Walton Multimodal Cold Start）中构建小型精炼数据集，并通过消融实验对比了增加数据量、多样性启发式和合成增强等方法的有效性。

Result: 基于难度的样本选择是性能提升的主要驱动因素；增加数据量不能稳定提高平均准确率，但能降低运行间方差；常用的多样性启发式和合成增强方法不仅没有额外收益，反而往往降低性能。

Conclusion: DCVLR挑战赛展示了一种饱和状态评估，强调了对齐和难度筛选在数据高效多模态推理中的核心重要性，特别是在模型和训练协议固定的情况下。

Abstract: We study data curation for multimodal reasoning through the NeurIPS 2025 Data Curation for Vision-Language Reasoning (DCVLR) challenge, which isolates dataset selection by fixing the model and training protocol. Using a compact curated dataset derived primarily from Walton Multimodal Cold Start, our submission placed first in the challenge. Through post-competition ablations, we show that difficulty-based example selection on an aligned base dataset is the dominant driver of performance gains. Increasing dataset size does not reliably improve mean accuracy under the fixed training recipe, but mainly reduces run-to-run variance, while commonly used diversity and synthetic augmentation heuristics provide no additional benefit and often degrade performance. These results characterize DCVLR as a saturation-regime evaluation and highlight the central role of alignment and difficulty in data-efficient multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: RL-based agentic search enables LLMs to solve complex questions via dynamic planning and external search. While this approach significantly enhances accuracy with agent policies optimized via large-scale reinforcement learning, we identify a critical gap in reliability: these agents fail to recognize their reasoning boundaries and rarely admit ``I DON'T KNOW'' (IDK) even when evidence is insufficient or reasoning reaches its limit. The lack of reliability often leads to plausible but unreliable answers, introducing significant risks in many real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose Boundary-Aware Policy Optimization (BAPO), a novel RL framework designed to cultivate reliable boundary awareness without compromising accuracy. BAPO introduces two key components: (i) a group-based boundary-aware reward that encourages an IDK response only when the reasoning reaches its limit, and (ii) an adaptive reward modulator that strategically suspends this reward during early exploration, preventing the model from exploiting IDK as a shortcut. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that BAPO substantially enhances the overall reliability of agentic search.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) based autonomous agents demonstrate multifaceted capabilities to contribute substantially to economic production. However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model agents are reshaping the industrial landscape. However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.

Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的多智能体系统的工作流生成方法包括任务级和查询级两种。前者计算成本高昂且评估不可靠，后者未必总是必要。需要一种成本收益更优的方案。

Method: 结合自我演进思想和生成式奖励建模，提出了 SCALE 框架，即少量校准下的自我预测优化器，避免全执行验证。通过生成评估来代替昂贵的全执行验证。

Result: SCALE在维持与现有方法竞争性的前提下，平均性能仅下降0.61%，同时将总体 token 使用量最多减少83%。

Conclusion: 任务级工作流生成配合 SCALE 的低成本评估框架，可以在节省大量计算成本的同时，几乎不损失系统性能，为多智能体系统提供了一种实用高效的方案。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) built on large language models typically solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents through workflows. Existing approaches generates workflows either at task level or query level, but their relative costs and benefits remain unclear. After rethinking and empirical analyses, we show that query-level workflow generation is not always necessary, since a small set of top-K best task-level workflows together already covers equivalent or even more queries. We further find that exhaustive execution-based task-level evaluation is both extremely token-costly and frequently unreliable. Inspired by the idea of self-evolution and generative reward modeling, we propose a low-cost task-level generation framework \textbf{SCALE}, which means \underline{\textbf{S}}elf prediction of the optimizer with few shot \underline{\textbf{CAL}}ibration for \underline{\textbf{E}}valuation instead of full validation execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{SCALE} maintains competitive performance, with an average degradation of just 0.61\% compared to existing approach across multiple datasets, while cutting overall token usage by up to 83\%.

Conclusion: Think-with-Me范式能有效提升推理效率和质量，在安全和创造性任务中也表现出益处

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at multi-step reasoning but often suffer from inefficient reasoning processes like overthinking and overshoot, where excessive or misdirected reasoning increases computational cost and degrades performance. Existing efficient reasoning methods operate in a closed-loop manner, lacking mechanisms for external intervention to guide the reasoning process. To address this, we propose Think-with-Me, a novel test-time interactive reasoning paradigm that introduces external feedback intervention into the reasoning process. Our key insights are that transitional conjunctions serve as natural points for intervention, signaling phases of self-validation or exploration and using transitional words appropriately to prolong the reasoning enhances performance, while excessive use affects performance. Building on these insights, Think-with-Me pauses reasoning at these points for external feedback, adaptively extending or terminating reasoning to reduce redundancy while preserving accuracy. The feedback is generated via a multi-criteria evaluation (rationality and completeness) and comes from either human or LLM proxies. We train the target model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to adapt to this interactive mode. Experiments show that Think-with-Me achieves a superior balance between accuracy and reasoning length under limited context windows. On AIME24, Think-with-Me outperforms QwQ-32B by 7.19% in accuracy while reducing average reasoning length by 81% under an 8K window. The paradigm also benefits security and creative tasks.

Motivation: 传统评估方法（如准确率、F1值）仅关注结果一致性，无法解释AI决策机制与人类的差异。需要一种能揭示底层决策逻辑、识别亚组间异质性对齐的方法。

Method: 提出XChoice框架：拟合基于机制的决策模型到人类数据和LLM生成决策，恢复可解释参数（决策因素相对重要性、约束敏感性、隐含权衡）。通过对参数向量的跨模型/选项/亚组比较评估对齐度。使用美国时间使用调查（ATUS）作为人类基准验证，并进行不变性分析和RAG干预的针对性缓解。

Result: 在美国人日常时间分配的评估中，揭示了模型和活动间的异质性对齐，突出显示黑人和已婚群体的显著错位。不变性分析验证了鲁棒性，RAG干预展示了针对性改进潜力。

Conclusion: XChoice提供了基于机制的度量指标，能够诊断错位并支持超越表面结果匹配的知情改进，为AI-人类对齐评估提供了更深入的分析工具。

Abstract: We present XChoice, an explainable framework for evaluating AI-human alignment in constrained decision making. Moving beyond outcome agreement such as accuracy and F1 score, XChoice fits a mechanism-based decision model to human data and LLM-generated decisions, recovering interpretable parameters that capture the relative importance of decision factors, constraint sensitivity, and implied trade-offs. Alignment is assessed by comparing these parameter vectors across models, options, and subgroups. We demonstrate XChoice on Americans' daily time allocation using the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) as human ground truth, revealing heterogeneous alignment across models and activities and salient misalignment concentrated in Black and married groups. We further validate robustness of XChoice via an invariance analysis and evaluate targeted mitigation with a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) intervention. Overall, XChoice provides mechanism-based metrics that diagnose misalignment and support informed improvements beyond surface outcome matching.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as generalist planners capable of reasoning and acting across diverse tasks. However, existing agent benchmarks largely focus on symbolic or weakly grounded environments, leaving their performance in physics-constrained real-world domains underexplored. We introduce AstroReason-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating agentic planning in Space Planning Problems (SPP), a family of high-stakes problems with heterogeneous objectives, strict physical constraints, and long-horizon decision-making. AstroReason-Bench integrates multiple scheduling regimes, including ground station communication and agile Earth observation, and provides a unified agent-oriented interaction protocol. Evaluating on a range of state-of-the-art open- and closed-source agentic LLM systems, we find that current agents substantially underperform specialized solvers, highlighting key limitations of generalist planning under realistic constraints. AstroReason-Bench offers a challenging and diagnostic testbed for future agentic research.

Abstract: The performance of constraint programming solvers is highly sensitive to the choice of their hyperparameters. Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time.
  We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations.
  Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.

Abstract: Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is upgrading health posts to improve access to essential services, particularly in rural areas. Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees. Experiments on real-world data from three Ethiopian regions demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and its potential to inform equitable, data-driven health system planning.

TL;DR: BoxMind是一个用于拳击战术分析的闭环AI专家系统，将比赛视频解析为层次化技术-战术指标，并通过图基预测模型结合显式指标与隐式嵌入来预测比赛结果，进而生成战术建议


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拳击等格斗类运动因动作动态复杂且缺乏结构化战术表示，在AI驱动的战术分析方面发展不足，需要开发能够分析复杂动作动态并提供战术建议的系统

Method: 通过定义具有精确时间边界和空间技术属性的原子击打事件，将比赛视频解析为18个层次化技术-战术指标；提出图基预测模型融合这些显式技术-战术特征与可学习的时变隐式嵌入来捕获拳手匹配动态；将比赛结果建模为技术-战术指标的可微函数

Result: 结果预测模型在BoxerGraph测试集上达到69.8%准确率，在奥运比赛中达到87.5%；生成的战略建议表现出与人类专家相当的能力；系统在2024年巴黎奥运会闭环部署，助力中国国家队取得三金两银的历史性成就

Conclusion: BoxMind建立了将非结构化视频数据转化为战略情报的可复制范式，弥合了计算机视觉与竞技体育决策支持之间的差距

Abstract: Competitive sports require sophisticated tactical analysis, yet combat disciplines like boxing remain underdeveloped in AI-driven analytics due to the complexity of action dynamics and the lack of structured tactical representations. To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals. BoxMind establishes a replicable paradigm for transforming unstructured video data into strategic intelligence, bridging the gap between computer vision and decision support in competitive sports.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种解析可逆的双射变换族（有理三次、双曲正弦、三次多项式），它们全局光滑、定义在全实数域、具有闭式解析逆，能够替代现有流模型中的变换层。此外，作者还提出了径向流架构，该架构通过径向坐标变换实现几何可解释的稳定训练，在具有径向结构的目标上能以极少的参数达到耦合流的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计归一化流的关键挑战在于寻找既表达力强又保持可逆性和易处理雅可比矩阵的标量双射。现有方法存在各种权衡：仿射变换光滑且解析可逆但缺乏表达力；单调样条提供局部控制但仅分段光滑且定义在有界域上；残差流实现光滑性但需要数值求逆。需要一种结合各种方法优点的解决方案。

Method: 1. 引入三种解析双射族：有理三次、双曲正弦、三次多项式，它们全局光滑（C∞）、定义在全实数域、具有闭式解析逆。
2. 这些双射可作为耦合流中的即插即用替代品。

Abstract: A key challenge in designing normalizing flows is finding expressive scalar bijections that remain invertible with tractable Jacobians. Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\infty$), defined on all of $\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $φ^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.

Conclusion: UOWQ框架通过联合优化权重和转移数量有效提升了多源迁移学习性能，理论和实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Transfer learning plays a vital role in improving model performance in data-scarce scenarios. However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in code generation models have unlocked unprecedented opportunities for automating feature engineering, yet their adoption in real-world ML teams remains constrained by critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of datasets capturing the iterative and complex coding processes of production-level feature engineering, (ii) limited integration and personalization of widely used coding agents, such as CoPilot and Devin, with a team's unique tools, codebases, workflows, and practices, and (iii) suboptimal human-AI collaboration due to poorly timed or insufficient feedback. We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively. In practice, when building features for recommendation models serving over 120 million users, our approach has delivered real-world impact by reducing feature engineering cycles from three weeks to a single day.

Abstract: Value level parallelism (VLP) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of large-batch, low-precision general matrix multiply (GEMM) between symmetric activations and weights. In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.

Abstract: Inverse design tools such as Topology Optimization (TO) can achieve new levels of improvement for high-performance engineered structures. However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.

Abstract: Traditional time series forecasting methods optimize for accuracy alone. This objective neglects temporal consistency, in other words, how consistently a model predicts the same future event as the forecast origin changes. We introduce the forecast accuracy and coherence score (forecast AC score for short) for measuring the quality of probabilistic multi-horizon forecasts in a way that accounts for both multi-horizon accuracy and stability. Our score additionally provides for user-specified weights to balance accuracy and consistency requirements. As an example application, we implement the score as a differentiable objective function for training seasonal ARIMA models and evaluate it on the M4 Hourly benchmark dataset. Results demonstrate substantial improvements over traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Our AC-optimized models achieve a 75\% reduction in forecast volatility for the same target timestamps while maintaining comparable or improved point forecast accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型在离线强化学习和基于模型的强化学习中至关重要，特别是在与真实环境交互成本高、危险或不切实际的场景中。现有世界模型的效能和可解释性严重依赖于训练数据质量，需要一种客观公正的数据选择方法。

Method: 提出Action Shapley作为与模型无关的度量标准，用于训练数据的明智且无偏选择。为了计算Action Shapley，设计了一种随机动态算法来缓解传统Shapley值计算的指数复杂度问题。

Result: 提出的算法在五个数据受限的真实世界案例研究中验证，相比传统的指数时间计算，计算效率提升超过80%。基于Action Shapley的训练数据选择策略持续优于临时性数据选择方法。

Conclusion: Action Shapley及其高效计算算法为世界模型训练提供了可靠的数据选择框架，在保证模型性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Numerous offline and model-based reinforcement learning systems incorporate world models to emulate the inherent environments. A world model is particularly important in scenarios where direct interactions with the real environment is costly, dangerous, or impractical. The efficacy and interpretability of such world models are notably contingent upon the quality of the underlying training data. In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data. To facilitate the computation of Action Shapley, we present a randomized dynamic algorithm specifically designed to mitigate the exponential complexity inherent in traditional Shapley value computations. Through empirical validation across five data-constrained real-world case studies, the algorithm demonstrates a computational efficiency improvement exceeding 80\% in comparison to conventional exponential time computations. Furthermore, our Action Shapley-based training data selection policy consistently outperforms ad-hoc training data selection.

TL;DR: 提出 FAConvLSTM（因子化注意力ConvLSTM），作为ConvLSTM2D的替代方案，通过分解门计算、多尺度深度卷积和轴向注意力机制，在提高效率的同时增强空间表达能力和物理可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ConvLSTM在处理高分辨率多元地球观测数据时面临计算成本高、局部感受野有限、难以捕捉长程遥相关性等挑战，需要更高效且具有物理意义的时空表示学习方法。

Method: 1. 使用轻量级1×1瓶颈和共享深度空间混合分解循环门计算，降低通道复杂度；2. 多尺度扩张深度卷积分支和挤压激励重校准实现跨尺度物理过程建模；3. 稀疏时间轴向空间注意力捕获遥相关依赖；4. 专用子空间头结合固定季节性位置编码的时间自注意力生成紧凑时间步嵌入。

Conclusion: FAConvLSTM通过创新设计有效解决了ConvLSTM在效率、空间表达和物理可解释性方面的局限，为地球观测数据分析提供了更优的深度学习架构。

Abstract: Learning physically meaningful spatiotemporal representations from high-resolution multivariate Earth observation data is challenging due to strong local dynamics, long-range teleconnections, multi-scale interactions, and nonstationarity. While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.

*Aakriti,Zhe Li,Dandan Liang,Chao Huang,Rui Li,Haibo Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOSL提出了一种混合阶次的分割学习框架，在客户端使用零阶优化以节省内存，服务器端使用一阶优化以保证性能，从而平衡内存效率与优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割学习系统主要依赖一阶优化，要求客户端存储中间量（如激活值），导致内存开销大，抵消了模型分割的优势。零阶优化虽减少内存使用，但收敛慢且性能下降。因此需要在内存效率和优化效果间取得平衡。

Method: HOSL框架在客户端采用内存高效的零阶梯度假计，消除反向传播和激活值存储；服务器端使用一阶优化确保快速收敛。理论分析表明收敛速率取决于客户端模型维度而非全模型维度。

Result: 在OPT模型（125M和1.3B参数）的6个任务上实验显示，HOSL相比一阶方法减少客户端GPU内存达3.7倍，同时准确率仅比基线低0.20%-4.23%；相比零阶基线性能提升达15.55%。

Conclusion: HOSL通过混合阶次优化策略有效解决了分割学习中内存效率与优化效果的权衡问题，为边缘设备上的内存高效训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGD的噪声通过形成有效势能驱动学习轨迹离开尖锐低谷、转向平坦区域，并通过瞬态冻结机制最终稳定在平坦极小值，这为理解SGD偏好平坦解的动力学机制提供了物理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中随机梯度下降（SGD）为何偏好更平坦、更具泛化能力的解，其动力学根源尚不清楚。研究旨在揭示SGD选择平坦解的非平衡机制，理解学习动态、损失景观几何与泛化之间的内在联系。

Method: 通过数值实验分析SGD学习动态，观察其轨迹在损失景观中的行为；建立可处理的物理模型，证明SGD噪声会重塑景观形成有效势能；分析能量壁垒增长导致的瞬态冻结机制，研究噪声强度对冻结时间和收敛到平坦极小值的影响。

Result: 数值实验发现SGD存在短暂的探索阶段，轨迹反复逃离尖锐低谷并转向平坦区域；理论分析表明SGD噪声形成的有效势能偏好平坦解；识别出瞬态冻结机制——随着训练进行，增大的能量壁垒会抑制山谷间转换，最终将动态困在单一盆地中；提高SGD噪声强度可延迟冻结，增强向平坦极小值的收敛。

Conclusion: 这些结果为理解SGD偏好平坦解的动力学机制提供了统一的物理框架，揭示了学习动态、损失景观几何与泛化之间的内在联系，并为设计更有效的优化算法提供了原理性指导。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is central to deep learning, yet the dynamical origin of its preference for flatter, more generalizable solutions remains unclear. Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.

*Zain ul Abdeen,Waris Gill,Ming Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MGF-RL框架，这是一种元引导的无梯度强化学习框架，旨在学习可迁移的初始化策略，以快速适应新的停电配置和可再生能源模式，从而实现分布电网的弹性恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于极端事件后，恢复关键负荷需要自适应控制来维持分布电网的弹性，但可再生能源发电的不确定性、可调度资源的有限性以及非线性动态使得有效恢复变得困难。传统强化学习方法在新的停电配置或发电模式下泛化能力差，且需要大量重新训练。

Method: MGF-RL结合一阶元学习和进化策略，学习了历史停电经验中的可迁移初始化策略，无需梯度计算就能进行可扩展的策略搜索，并且能够处理非线性、受约束的分布系统动态。

Result: 在IEEE 13总线和IEEE 123总线测试系统上的实验表明，MGF-RL在可靠性、恢复速度和适应效率方面均优于标准RL、基于MAML的元RL和模型预测控制，尤其在存在可再生能源预测误差时表现突出。该方法能够泛化到未见过的停电和可再生能源模式，且比传统RL需要更少的微调次数。

Conclusion: MGF-RL框架提供了次线性遗憾界限，将适应效率与任务相似性和环境变化联系起来，支持了其经验优势，并表明该方法适用于可再生能源丰富的分布电网中的实时负荷恢复。

Abstract: Restoring critical loads after extreme events demands adaptive control to maintain distribution-grid resilience, yet uncertainty in renewable generation, limited dispatchable resources, and nonlinear dynamics make effective restoration difficult. Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.

Motivation: 小型代码模型适合资源受限环境，但它们通常只输出单一预测，难以确定是否真正理解了程序结构而非仅依赖浅层关联

Method: 提出推理蒸馏方法：使用大型教师模型提供结构化符号推理标签（捕捉错误的高层因果特性）和修复类型标签；在IntroClass基准上训练CodeT5学生模型，比较纯标签监督和推理蒸馏两种设置

Conclusion: 符号推理蒸馏是提升轻量级程序修复模型可解释性和鲁棒性的实用方法

Abstract: We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.

### [111] [Constant Metric Scaling in Riemannian Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10992)
*Kisung You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇笔记阐述了黎曼度量的常数缩放对几何量（如距离、体积）的影响，并区分了在缩放下保持不变的关键几何概念（如联络、测地线）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在计算设置中经常出现的黎曼度量常数缩放操作，其影响在实践中并不总是清晰，容易与曲率、流形结构或坐标表示的变化混淆。本文旨在澄清这一基本操作对几何量的影响，并明确区分那些在缩放下保持不变的几何概念。

Method: 提供了关于任意黎曼流形上常数度量缩放的简明、自包含阐述，通过理论分析区分了在缩放下变化的量（范数、距离、体积元、梯度大小）和不变的几何对象（Levi-Civita联络、测地线、指数映射、对数映射、平行移动）。

Result: 明确了常数度量缩放不会改变流形的内在几何结构，而只影响相关的度量量。这种缩放可以解释为步长的全局重新标定，而非底层几何的修改。

Conclusion: 笔记阐明了在黎曼计算中引入全局度量尺度参数时，如何在不改变方法所依赖的几何结构的前提下进行操作，为黎曼优化等相关计算提供了概念澄清。

Abstract: Constant rescaling of a Riemannian metric appears in many computational settings, often through a global scale parameter that is introduced either explicitly or implicitly. Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has become a leading self- supervised approach to representation learning across domains, including vision, multimodal settings, graphs, and federated learning. However, recent studies have shown that contrastive learning is susceptible to backdoor and data poisoning attacks. In these attacks, adversaries can manipulate pretraining data or model updates to insert hidden malicious behavior. This paper offers a thorough and comparative review of backdoor attacks in contrastive learning. It analyzes threat models, attack methods, target domains, and available defenses. We summarize recent advancements in this area, underline the specific vulnerabilities inherent to contrastive learning, and discuss the challenges and future research directions. Our findings have significant implications for the secure deployment of systems in industrial and distributed environments.

Abstract: Interpretable graph learning has recently emerged as a popular research topic in machine learning. The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.
  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.

Abstract: The accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is crucial for novel drug development. However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions. AVP-Pro provides a powerful and interpretable new tool for the high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. To further enhance accessibility for users, we have developed a user-friendly web interface, which is available at https://wwwy1031-avp-pro.hf.space.

Abstract: Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is one of the most fundamental problems in service computing and personalized recommendation. In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.
  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves competitive results.

A learning algorithm of the Soft-BCT is proposed based on the variational inference. For some real-world datasets, the Soft-BCT demonstrates almost the same or superior performance to the previous BCT.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on downstream tasks is crucial for realizing their cross-domain potential but often relies on sensitive data, raising privacy concerns. Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental tool that has garnered significant interest across a wide range of applications including text analysis. To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance. The results show that our method achieves clustering accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing the number of LLM queries by more than 20 times.

Abstract: Shape-morphing soft materials can enable diverse target morphologies through voxel-level material distribution design, offering significant potential for various applications. Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.

Method: 联邦生存学习框架（FSL-BDP），结合贝叶斯差分隐私，在不集中敏感数据的情况下联合学习风险动态，提供数据依赖的差分隐私保证

Result: 在三个真实信用数据集上的实验表明：联邦学习改变隐私机制相对有效性；贝叶斯DP在联邦设置中表现显著优于经典DP（+7.0% vs +1.4%），达到接近非私有性能水平，在大多数参与客户中优于经典DP

Conclusion: 隐私机制选择应在目标部署架构中评估而非集中式基准；为受监管多机构环境中设计隐私保护决策支持系统提供实用指导

Abstract: Credit risk models are a critical decision-support tool for financial institutions, yet tightening data-protection rules (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) increasingly prohibit cross-border sharing of borrower data, even as these models benefit from cross-institution learning. Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\% vs +1.4\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks. These findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners designing privacy-preserving decision support systems in regulated, multi-institutional environments.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.

Abstract: Unplanned engine failures in helicopters can lead to severe operational disruptions, safety hazards, and costly repairs. To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.

Abstract: The computation of resistance distance is pivotal in a wide range of graph analysis applications, including graph clustering, link prediction, and graph neural networks. Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $κ$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $κ$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\tilde{O}(\sqrtκ m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\sqrtκ$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\tilde{O}(κ^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $κ^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets of varying sizes and statistical properties, demonstrating that Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push significantly outperform SOTA methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.
  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.
  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning. So, there is still much room for improvement.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation tackles the problem that domain shifts between training and test data impair the performance of neural networks in many real-world applications. Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Abstract: Unplanned failures in industrial hydraulic pumps can halt production and incur substantial costs. We explore two unsupervised autoencoder (AE) schemes for early fault detection: a feed-forward model that analyses individual sensor snapshots and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model that captures short temporal windows. Both networks are trained only on healthy data drawn from a minute-level log of 52 sensor channels; evaluation uses a separate set that contains seven annotated fault intervals. Despite the absence of fault samples during training, the models achieve high reliability.

Abstract: Generative modeling offers a promising solution to data scarcity and privacy challenges in time series analysis. However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods. Notably, our model achieves strong performance with a significantly reduced parameter count and exhibits superior capability in generating high-quality long-term sequences. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TimeMAR-BC5B.

Abstract: Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an efficient numerical compression scheme for deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices, the representativeness and universality of calibration data remain a core bottleneck in determining the accuracy of quantization parameters. Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) for large language models (LLMs) has attracted increasing attention as a way to enable privacy-preserving adaptation over distributed data. Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module. Experiments on GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that SDFLoRA outperforms representative federated LoRA baselines and achieves a better utility-privacy trade-off.

Abstract: For linear partial differential equations with known fundamental solutions, this work introduces a novel operator learning framework that relies exclusively on domain boundary data, including solution values and normal derivatives, rather than full-domain sampling. By integrating the previously developed Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) method, which enforces physical consistency, all training data are synthesized directly from the fundamental solutions of the target problems, resulting in a fully data-driven pipeline without the need for external measurements or numerical simulations. We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms. The proposed method is validated on benchmark operator learning tasks for two-dimensional Laplace, Poisson, and Helmholtz equations, where it achieves accuracy comparable to or better than existing neural operator approaches while significantly reducing training time. The framework is naturally extensible to three-dimensional problems and complex geometries.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face the "knowledge cutoff" challenge, where their frozen parametric memory prevents direct internalization of new information. While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.

Abstract: Boosting is a powerful method that turns weak learners, which perform only slightly better than random guessing, into strong learners with high accuracy. While boosting is well understood in the classic setting, it is less so in the agnostic case, where no assumptions are made about the data. Indeed, only recently was the sample complexity of agnostic boosting nearly settled arXiv:2503.09384, but the known algorithm achieving this bound has exponential running time. In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with limited objective diagnostic tools, highlighting the urgent need for objective, biology-based diagnostic frameworks in precision psychiatry. We integrate urinary metabolomics with an interpretable machine learning framework to identify biochemical signatures associated with ADHD. Targeted metabolomic profiles from 52 ADHD and 46 control participants were analyzed using a Closest Resemblance (CR) classifier with embedded feature selection. The CR model outperformed Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, achieving an AUC > 0.97 based on a reduced panel of 14 metabolites. These metabolites including dopamine 4-sulfate, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, and citrulline map to dopaminergic neurotransmission and amino acid metabolism pathways, offering mechanistic insight into ADHD pathophysiology. The CR classifier's transparent decision boundaries and low computational cost support integration into targeted metabolomic assays and future point of care diagnostic platforms. Overall, this work demonstrates a translational framework combining metabolomics and interpretable machine learning to advance objective, biologically informed diagnostic strategies for ADHD.

Abstract: Tabular data high-stakes critical decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific discovery. Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is fundamental in industrial domains like manufacturing and smart factories. As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.

Abstract: Energy efficiency has become an integral aspect of modern computing infrastructure design, impacting the performance, cost, scalability, and durability of production systems. The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.
  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.
  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.

Abstract: Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).

Abstract: This work describes a novel data-driven latent space inference framework built on paired autoencoders to handle observational inconsistencies when solving inverse problems. Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.

Abstract: Credit assignment is a core challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), especially in large-scale systems with structured, local interactions. Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown strong performance in learning solution maps of partial differential equations (PDEs), but their robustness under distribution shifts, long-horizon rollouts, and structural perturbations remains poorly understood. We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.

Abstract: Urban wind flow reconstruction is essential for assessing air quality, heat dispersion, and pedestrian comfort, yet remains challenging when only sparse sensor data are available. We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes. Experiments are conducted on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a real urban neighbourhood in Bristol, United Kingdom, at a characteristic Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}\approx2\times10^{7}$, featuring complex building geometry and irregular terrain. The proposed framework provides a scalable path toward generative, geometry-aware data assimilation for environmental monitoring in complex domains.

Abstract: Transformer pretraining is increasingly constrained by memory and compute requirements, with the key-value (KV) cache emerging as a dominant bottleneck during training and autoregressive decoding. We propose \textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.
  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \textbf{20-25\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization. Together, these results establish LRKV as a practical and effective attention mechanism for scaling Transformer pretraining under memory- and compute-constrained regimes.

Abstract: Extractive summarization (ES) aims to generate a concise summary by selecting a subset of sentences from a document while maximizing relevance and minimizing redundancy. Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.

Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.

Abstract: This paper addresses the joint optimization of trajectories and bandwidth allocation for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance energy efficiency in the cooperative data collection problem. We focus on an important yet underestimated aspect of the system, where action synchronization across all UAVs is impossible. Since most existing learning-based solutions are not designed to learn in this asynchronous environment, we formulate the trajectory planning problem as a Decentralized Partially Observable Semi-Markov Decision Process and introduce an asynchronous multi-agent learning algorithm to learn UAVs' cooperative policies. Once the UAVs' trajectory policies are learned, the bandwidth allocation can be optimally solved based on local observations at each collection point. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over other learning-based and heuristic baselines in terms of both energy efficiency and mission completion time. Additionally, the learned policies exhibit robustness under varying environmental conditions.

Abstract: This report studies whether small, tool-augmented agents can match or outperform larger monolithic models on the GAIA benchmark. Using Qwen3 models (4B-32B) within an adapted Agentic-Reasoning framework, we isolate the effects of model scale, explicit thinking (no thinking, planner-only, or full), and tool use (search, code, mind-map). Tool augmentation provides the largest and most consistent gains. Using tools, 4B models can outperform 32B models without tool access on GAIA in our experimental setup. In contrast, explicit thinking is highly configuration- and difficulty-dependent: planner-only thinking can improve decomposition and constraint tracking, while unrestricted full thinking often degrades performance by destabilizing tool orchestration, leading to skipped verification steps, excessive tool calls, non-termination, and output-format drift.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Social robots hold promise for reducing job interview anxiety, yet designing agents that provide both psychological safety and instructional guidance remains challenging. Through a three-phase iterative design study (N = 8), we empirically mapped this tension. Phase I revealed a "Safety-Guidance Gap": while a Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) robot established safety (d = 3.27), users felt insufficiently coached. Phase II identified a "Scaffolding Paradox": rigid feedback caused cognitive overload, while delayed feedback lacked specificity. In Phase III, we resolved these tensions by developing an Agency-Driven Interaction Layer. Synthesizing our empirical findings, we propose the Adaptive Scaffolding Ecosystem, a conceptual framework that redefines robotic coaching not as a static script, but as a dynamic balance between affective support and instructional challenge, mediated by user agency.

Method: 对60位视障TikTok用户（称为"盲人抖音用户"）进行访谈研究，分析其职业发展经验、目标、策略和挑战。

Result: 发现盲人抖音用户的实践展现了一种比传统模式更灵活、包容、个性化和多样化的替代性职业发展途径，这些实践突出了新兴数字技能。

Conclusion: 研究拓展了职业发展研究，突出了新兴数字技能的重要性，并提出了促进更公平和包容性职业机会的设计建议。

Abstract: One's profession is an essential part of modern life. Traditionally, professional development has been criticized for excluding people with disabilities. People with visual impairments, for example, face disproportionately low employment rates, highlighting persistent gaps in professional opportunities. Recently, there has been growing research on social media platforms as spaces for more equitable career development approaches. In this paper, we present an interview study on the professional development experiences of 60 people with visual impairments on TikTok (also known as "BlindTokers"). We report BlindTokers' goals, strategies, and challenges, supported by detailed examples and in-depth analysis. Based on the findings, we identify that BlindTokers' practices reveal an alternative professional development approach that is more flexible, inclusive, personalized, and diversified than traditional models. Our study also extends professional development research by foregrounding emerging digital skills and proposing design implications to foster more equitable and inclusive professional opportunities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present Haptic Light-Emitting Diodes (HLEDs), luminous thermopneumatic actuators that directly convert pulsed light into mechanical forces and displacements. Each device packages a miniature surface-mount LED in a gas-filled cavity that contains a low-inertia graphite photoabsorber. The cavity is sealed by an elastic membrane, which functions as a working diaphragm. Brief optical pulses heat the photoabsorber, which heats the gas. The resulting rapid pressure increases generate forces and displacements at the working diaphragm. Millimeter-scale HLEDs produce forces exceeding 0.4 N and displacements of 1 mm at low voltages, with 5 to 100 ms response times, making them attractive as actuators providing tactile feedback in human-machine interfaces. Perceptual testing revealed that the strength of tactile feedback increased linearly with optical power. HLEDs devices are mechanically simple and efficient to fabricate. Unusually, these actuators are also light-emitting, as a fraction of optical energy is transmitted through the membrane. These opto-mechanical actuators have many potential applications in tactile displays, human interface engineering, wearable computing, and other areas.

Abstract: We present our first stage results from deploying an LLM-augmented visualization software in a classroom setting to engage primary school children with earth-related datasets. Motivated by the growing interest in conversational AI as a means to support inquiry-based learning, we investigate children's expectations, engagement, and evaluation of a spoken LLM interface with a shared, immersive visualization system in a formal educational context. Our system integrates a speech-capable large language model with an interactive spherical display. It enables children to ask natural-language questions and receive coordinated verbal explanations and visual responses through the LLM-augmented visualization updating in real time based on spoken queries. We report on a classroom study with Swedish children aged 9-10, combining structured observation and small-group discussions to capture expectations prior to interaction, interaction patterns during facilitated sessions, and children's reflections on their encounter afterward. Our results provide empirical insights into children's initial encounters with an LLM-enabled visualization platform within a classroom setting and their expectations, interactions, and evaluations of the system. These findings inform the technology's potential for educational use and highlight important directions for future research.

Conclusion: 贡献了人类-AI协作声明可视化方案及其评估，并警示可视化设计可能会改变人们对AI在新闻创作中实际角色的认知

Abstract: Within journalistic editorial processes, disclosing AI usage is currently limited to simplistic labels, which misses the nuance of how humans and AI collaborated on a news article. Through co-design sessions (N=10), we elicited 69 disclosure designs and implemented four prototypes that visually disclose human-AI collaboration in journalism. We then ran a within-subjects lab study (N=32) to examine how disclosure visualizations (Textual, Role-based Timeline, Task-based Timeline, Chatbot) and collaboration ratios (Primarily Human vs. Primarily AI) influenced visualization perceptions, gaze patterns, and post-experience responses. We found that textual disclosures were least effective in communicating human-AI collaboration, whereas Chatbot offered the most in-depth information. Furthermore, while role-based timelines amplified AI contribution in primarily human articles, task-based timeline shifted perceptions toward human involvement in primarily AI articles. We contribute Human-AI collaboration disclosure visualizations and their evaluation, and cautionary considerations on how visualizations can alter perceptions of AI's actual role during news article creation.

Method: AI Twin 將學習者的語句重述為更流利英語，以學習者聲音輸出，隱性反饋保持對話流暢；通過內部受試研究，比較顯性糾錯與非個性化重述。

Result: 20名成人ESL學習者中，AI Twin 顯著提升情感投入與動機，參與者反饋更積極，凸顯個性化、心理基礎支持的效果。

Conclusion: 基於自我表徵的AI（如AI Twin），在ESL學習中提供個性化、心理學基礎支持，具有潛在價值，強調隱性反饋與理想L2自我的結合。

Abstract: Advances in AI have enabled ESL learners to practice speaking through conversational systems. However, most tools rely on explicit correction, which can interrupt the conversation and undermine confidence. Grounded in second language acquisition and motivational psychology, we present AI Twin, a system that rephrases learner utterances into more fluent English and delivers them in the learner's voice. Embodying a more confident and proficient version of the learner, AI Twin reinforces motivation through alignment with their aspirational Ideal L2 Self. Also, its use of implicit feedback through rephrasing preserves conversational flow and fosters an emotionally supportive environment. In a within-subject study with 20 adult ESL learners, we compared AI Twin with explicit correction and a non-personalized rephrasing agent. Results show that AI Twin elicited higher emotional engagement, with participants describing the experience as more motivating. These findings highlight the potential of self-representative AI for personalized, psychologically grounded support in ESL learning.

Abstract: The high-level structure of a graph is a crucial ingredient for the analysis and visualization of relational data. However, discovering the salient graph patterns that form this structure is notoriously difficult for two reasons. (1) Finding important patterns, such as cliques and bicliques, is computationally hard. (2) Real-world graphs contain noise, and therefore do not always exhibit patterns in their pure form. Defining meaningful noisy patterns and detecting them efficiently is a currently unsolved challenge. In this paper, we propose to use well-ordered matrices as a tool to both define and effectively detect noisy patterns. Specifically, we represent a graph as its adjacency matrix and optimally order it using Moran's $I$. Standard graph patterns (cliques, bicliques, and stars) now translate to rectangular submatrices. Using Moran's $I$, we define a permitted level of noise for such patterns. A combination of exact algorithms and heuristics allows us to efficiently decompose the matrix into noisy patterns. We also introduce a novel motif simplification that visualizes noisy patterns while explicitly encoding the level of noise. We showcase our techniques on several real-world data sets.

Abstract: Accessing video games is challenging for people with upper-limb impairments, especially when multiple inputs are required in rapid succession. Human cooperation, where a copilot assists the main player, has been proposed as a solution, but relying on a human assistant poses limitations in terms of availability and co-location. An alternative solution is to use partial automation, where the player is assisted by a software agent. In this work, we present a study with 13 participants with upper-limb impairments, comparatively evaluating how participants collaborate with their copilot in human cooperation and partial automation. The experiment is supported by GamePals, a modular framework that enables both human cooperation and partial automation on existing third-party video games.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了一个LLM驱动的对话副驾驶系统，旨在通过脚手架式提问来培养用户信息评估能力而非提供答案。研究发现用户与系统进行了深入的元认知反思，但未能显著提升答案准确性或搜索参与度，主要受限于‘聊天时间与探索时间’的权衡以及用户对正面信息的偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式AI工具存在过度依赖风险，可能削弱独立验证和推理能力。研究者认为AI系统不应取代用户的认知工作，而应支持和搭建其认知过程，因此开发了这种教学型副驾驶来提升数字素养。

Method: 采用预注册随机对照试验（N=261），比较三种界面条件（包括聊天副驾驶）。通过混合方法分析，定量评估答案正确性和搜索参与度，定性分析用户交互模式。

Result: 用户深度参与副驾驶对话并展现出元认知反思，但副驾驶未显著提高答案正确性或搜索参与度。关键障碍包括时间分配权衡（聊天vs探索）和用户对正面信息的认知偏见。

Conclusion: 教学型副驾驶在促进反思方面具有潜力，但也面临效率与素养培养目标的张力。未来设计需平衡教学目标和用户对效率的需求，开发更有效的数字素养培养工具。

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) tools are transforming information seeking, but their fluent, authoritative responses risk overreliance and discourage independent verification and reasoning. Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a "time-on-chat vs. exploration" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information. Qualitative findings reveal tension between the copilot's Socratic approach and users' desire for efficiency. These results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of pedagogical copilots, and we outline design pathways to reconcile literacy goals with efficiency demands.

Motivation: 许多用户在进行在线搜索和批判性评估时存在困难，特别是在健康等高风险领域，且经常高估自己的数字素养，需要一种轻量级辅助工具来提升搜索素养。

Method: 开发了一个交互式搜索助手，在现有搜索引擎结果页面上提供情境感知提示，包括澄清信息需求、改进查询表述、鼓励结果探索和减轻偏见等策略，采用受控实现而非实时LLM自适应。

Result: 用户研究表明，该助手成功鼓励了更主动和探索性的搜索行为：用户提交的查询数量增加75%，查看的结果数量约增加一倍，在困难任务中表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 轻量级的情境引导可以通过微学习机会增强搜索素养并赋能用户，这为未来实现实时LLM自适应搜索辅助提供了基础。

Abstract: Many users struggle with effective online search and critical evaluation, especially in high-stakes domains like health, while often overestimating their digital literacy. Thus, in this demo, we present an interactive search companion that seamlessly integrates expert search strategies into existing search engine result pages. Providing context-aware tips on clarifying information needs, improving query formulation, encouraging result exploration, and mitigating biases, our companion aims to foster reflective search behaviour while minimising cognitive burden. A user study demonstrates the companion's successful encouragement of more active and exploratory search, leading users to submit 75 % more queries and view roughly twice as many results, as well as performance gains in difficult tasks. This demo illustrates how lightweight, contextual guidance can enhance search literacy and empower users through micro-learning opportunities. While the vision involves real-time LLM adaptivity, this study utilises a controlled implementation to test the underlying intervention strategies.

Motivation: 目前教学机器人多使用机身屏幕呈现内容，但在边走边学的场景中，屏幕会分散学习者对真实物体的注意力，增加额外的认知负荷。人机交互领域缺乏对投影与屏幕两种方式的实证比较，也缺乏相关设计知识。

Method: 研究开发了ProjecTA——一个半人形、具备手势能力的教学机器人，通过投影在物体附近显示内容，并与语音和手势协调配合。在大学的创客空间对24名参与者进行了混合方法研究，比较了ProjecTA与屏幕式机器人的效果。

Result: ProjecTA显著降低了额外认知负荷，在感知可用性、视觉显示的有用性和跨模态互补性方面均优于屏幕式机器人。定性分析显示，ProjecTA的协调投影、手势和语音将解释锚定在特定地点和时间，以屏幕无法实现的方式增强了理解。

Conclusion: 研究为未来利用空间投影支持物理环境中移动学习的教学机器人提出了关键设计启示。

Abstract: Robotic teaching assistants (TAs) often use body-mounted screens to deliver content. In nomadic, walk-and-talk learning, such as tours in makerspaces, these screens can distract learners from real-world objects, increasing extraneous cognitive load. HCI research lacks empirical comparisons of potential alternatives, such as robots with in-situ projection versus screen-based counterparts; little knowledge has been derived for designing such alternatives. We introduce ProjecTA, a semi-humanoid, gesture-capable TA that guides learners while projecting near-object overlays coordinated with speech and gestures. In a mixed-method study (N=24) in a university makerspace, ProjecTA significantly reduced extraneous load and outperformed its screen-based counterpart in perceived usability, usefulness of visual display, and cross-modal complementarity. Qualitative analyses revealed how ProjecTA's coordinated projections, gestures, and speech anchored explanations in place and time, enhancing understanding in ways a screen could not. We derive key design implications for future robotic TAs leveraging spatial projection to support mobile learning in physical environments.

Abstract: It has been ten years since the term ''Immersive Analytics'' (IA) was coined and research interest in the topic remains strong. Researchers in this field have produced practical and conceptual knowledge concerning the use of emerging immersive spatial display and interaction technologies for sense-making tasks through a number of papers, surveys, and books. However, a lack of truly physically and psychologically ergonomic techniques, as well as standardized human-centric validation protocols for these, remains a significant barrier to wider acceptance of practical IA systems in ubiquitous applications. Building upon a series of workshops on immersive analytics at various conferences, this workshop aims to explore new approaches and establish standard practices for evaluating immersive analytics systems from a human factors perspective. We will gather immersive analytics researchers and practitioners to look closely at these human factors -- including cognitive and physical functions as well as behaviour and performance -- to see how they inform the design and deployment of immersive analytics techniques and applications and to inform future research.

Motivation: 尽管大量研究关注AI解释在复杂信息搜索任务（如事实核查）中的支持作用，但证据的作用却鲜有研究。本文旨在探究证据在用户评估AI系统预测中的作用，以及如何结合解释和证据来支持决策。

Method: 研究者系统性地改变了解释类型、AI预测确定性和AI系统建议的正确性，让非专家参与者评估声明的真实性以及AI系统预测。参与者可以选择轻松检查底层证据，并通过定量和定性方法分析他们的行为。

Result: 研究发现参与者在所有实验条件下始终依赖证据来验证AI主张。当提供自然语言解释时，参与者使用证据的频率较低，但当解释显得不足或有缺陷时，他们仍然会依赖证据。定性数据表明，参与者试图推断证据来源的可靠性，尽管来源身份被故意隐藏。

Conclusion: 证据是评估AI系统信息可靠性的关键成分，与自然语言解释相结合，可以为决策制定提供有价值的支持。迫切需要进一步研究证据应如何呈现以及用户在实践中如何与证据互动。

Abstract: Although much research has focused on AI explanations to support decisions in complex information-seeking tasks such as fact-checking, the role of evidence is surprisingly under-researched. In our study, we systematically varied explanation type, AI prediction certainty, and correctness of AI system advice for non-expert participants, who evaluated the veracity of claims and AI system predictions. Participants were provided the option of easily inspecting the underlying evidence. We found that participants consistently relied on evidence to validate AI claims across all experimental conditions. When participants were presented with natural language explanations, evidence was used less frequently although they relied on it when these explanations seemed insufficient or flawed. Qualitative data suggests that participants attempted to infer evidence source reliability, despite source identities being deliberately omitted. Our results demonstrate that evidence is a key ingredient in how people evaluate the reliability of information presented by an AI system and, in combination with natural language explanations, offers valuable support for decision-making. Further research is urgently needed to understand how evidence ought to be presented and how people engage with it in practice.

Abstract: Sociotechnical challenges of machine learning in healthcare and social welfare are mismatches between how a machine learning tool functions and the structure of care practices. While prior research has documented many such issues, existing accounts often attribute them either to designers' limited social understanding or to inherent technical constraints, offering limited support for systematic description and comparison across settings. In this paper, we present a framework for conceptualizing sociotechnical challenges of machine learning grounded in qualitative fieldwork, a review of longitudinal deployment studies, and co-design workshops with healthcare and social welfare practitioners. The framework comprises (1) a categorization of eleven sociotechnical challenges organized along an ML-enabled care pathway, and (2) a process-oriented account of the conditions through which these challenges emerge across design and use. By providing a parsimonious vocabulary and an explanatory lens focused on practice, this work supports more precise analysis of how machine learning tools function and malfunction within real-world care delivery.
